Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. It was a simple machine that changed my life.Before that time, I had never been away from my home in Malawi. I had never used a computer. I had never seen an Internet. On the stage that day, I was so nervous. My English lost, I wanted to vomit. (Laughter) I had never been surrounded by so many azungu, white people. (Laughter)There was a story I wouldn't tell you then. But well, I'm feeling good right now. I would like to share that story today. We have seven children in my family. All sisters, excepting me. This is me with my dad when I was a little boy. Before I discovered the wonders of science, I was just a simple farmer in a country of poor farmers. Like everyone else, we grew maize.One year our fortune turned very bad. In 2001 we experienced an awful famine. Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death. My family ate one meal per day, at night. Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us. The food passes through our bodies. We drop down to nothing.In Malawi, the secondary school, you have to pay school fees. Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school. I looked at my father and looked at those dry fields. It was the future I couldn't accept.I felt very happy to be at the secondary school, so I was determined to do anything possible to receive education. So I went to a library. I read books, science books, especially physics. I couldn't read English that well. I used diagrams and pictures to learn the words around them.Another book put that knowledge in my hands. It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity. Pump water meant irrigation, a defense against hunger, which we were experiencing by that time. So I decided I would build one windmill for myself. But I didn't have materials to use, so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials. Many people, including my mother, said I was crazy. (Laughter)I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes. Using a bicycle frame and an old bicycle dynamo, I built my machine. It was one light at first. And then four lights, with switches, and even a circuit breaker, modeled after an electric bell. Another machine pumps water for irrigation.Queues of people start lining up at my house (Laughter) to charge their mobile phone. (Applause) I could not get rid of them. (Laughter) And the reporters came too, which lead to bloggers and which lead to a call from something called TED. I had never seen an airplane before. I had never slept in a hotel. So, on stage that day in Arusha, my English lost, I said something like, \"I tried. And I made it.\"So I would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the Africans, and the poor who are struggling with your dreams. God bless. Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet. I say to you, trust yourself and believe. Whatever happens, don't give up. Thank you.

It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia. And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.And it read \u2014 I'm just going to read a key sentence: \"Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to.\"Photography threatens fantasy. They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth. But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.Over a five year period following September 11th, when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders, most notably weapons of mass destruction, I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America's foundation, mythology and daily functioning. I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information. And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph. And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders. And the outsider can never really reach the core.I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series. It's titled, \"An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,\" and it's comprised of nearly 70 images. In this context I'll just show you a few. This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State, where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water. A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly. And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America, which you can see here.And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text. So I create these two poles. Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text. And what I'm most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image, and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image. So, at best, the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy. And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground. But in this context I'm just going to read an abridged version of those texts.This is a cryopreservation unit, and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger, who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health, with advancements in science and technology, all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty. Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state, allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage. So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen, allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse, to simulate the loss of virginity.This is a jury simulation deliberation room, and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror. And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they're hoping for. This process costs 60,000 dollars.This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room, a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport. On that table you can see 48 hours' worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States. There is a pig's head and African cane rats. And part of my photographic work is I'm not just documenting what's there. I do take certain liberties and intervene. And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting, so I spent some time with the smells and items.This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building. And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts. And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics. And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency, and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility, and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition. And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene.This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States. It's a research crop marijuana grow room.And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things \u2014 they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security \u2014 and you can't completely understand how information is being distributed.These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, connecting North America to Europe. They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations, and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability. This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut. But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn't necessarily progressed.This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. (Laughter) And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired, and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity. And Playboy is always in the top few. (Laughter) But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text. (Laughter)This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine, where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza. This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead. And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States. And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film. And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding \u2014 that would be mother to son, father to daughter, sister to brother \u2014 to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger. Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose. And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth. It's a very violent process that is little known. And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment. Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood. He has since passed away, but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.This, on a lighter note, is at George Lucas' personal archive. This is the Death Star. And it's shown here in its true orientation. In the context of \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,\" its mirror image is presented. They flip the negative. And you can see the photoetched brass detailing, and the painted acrylic facade. In the context of the film, this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire, capable of annihilating planets and civilizations, and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet. (Laughter)This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site. Essentially they've simulated a city for urban combat, and this is one of the structures that exists in that city. It's called the World Church of God. It's supposed to be a generic site of worship. And after I took this photograph, they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq. And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice. And we put that wall around the World Church of God, and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army. And I put them into my photograph.This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity.And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world. It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free. However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States. And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.Now I'm going to move on to another project I did. It's titled \"The Innocents.\" And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy. Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie. I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction, and its influence on memory, which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences. For the men in these photographs, the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification. A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement's use of images. But through exposure to composite sketches, Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups, eyewitness testimony can change.I'll give you an example from a case. A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker. She saw some similarities in one of the photographs, but couldn't quite make a positive identification. Days later, she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs, except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array. And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory, if there ever was an actual memory.Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals, and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications.Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location, where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime. He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft. And he served 10 years of a life sentence. Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison. But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young girl walking to school. He served 18 years of a death sentence. I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho. And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction. The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification, the alibi location. And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place to which he's never been, but changed his life forever. So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction, in both his life and in photography.Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder. He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest, where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana, in this very room to hide from the police. He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery. The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification, days later, from a photo array.Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival. He is photographed at his alibi location.Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club, and served 11 years of a death sentence. I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's to play professional baseball just before his conviction. And the state's key witness in Ron's case was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman. I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary. He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime, was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence, for several charges of rape and robbery. He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia. He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery, and served seven years of a 47 year sentence. Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old. The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait. And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived. That's it. Thank you.

phone calls\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nto access my subjects,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nwhich can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nto a hibernating black bear in its cave\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin West Virginia.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd oddly, the most notable\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nletter of rejection I ever received\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\ncame from Walt Disney World,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\na seemingly innocuous site.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\n\"Especially during these violent times,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI personally believe\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthat the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nis particularly important to protect\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand helps to provide them with an important fantasy\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthey can escape to.\"\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nPhotography threatens fantasy.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThey didn't want to let my camera in\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nbecause it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand provides what appears to be\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nevidence of a truth.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut there are multiple truths attached to every image,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\ndepending on the creator's intention, the viewer\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nand the context in which it is presented.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nOver a five year period following September 11th,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwhen the American media and government were seeking\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nhidden and unknown sites\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nbeyond its borders,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nmost notably weapons of mass destruction,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nI chose to look inward at that which was integral\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nto America's foundation,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nmythology and daily functioning.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nI wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nself-imposed and real,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand confront the divide between privileged\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand public access to knowledge.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nIt was a critical moment in American history\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand global history\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwhere one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAnd I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbut what I came away with is a photograph.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd it's just another place from which to observe,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the understanding that\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthere are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd the outsider can never really reach the core.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nI'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nIt's titled, \"An American Index\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nof the Hidden and Unfamiliar,\"\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand it's comprised of nearly 70 images.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIn this context I'll just show you a few.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThis is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nat Hanford site in Washington State,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhere there are over 1,900\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nstainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nsubmerged in water.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nA human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd I found one section amongst all of these\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat actually resembled the outline\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nof the United States of America,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich you can see here.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd a big part of the work that is\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nsort of absent in this context is text.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo I create these two poles.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nEvery image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd what I'm most interested in\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nis the invisible space between a text\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand its accompanying image,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand how the image is transformed by the text\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand the text by the image.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo, at best, the image is meant to float away\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\ninto abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd then the text functions as this cruel anchor\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthat kind of nails it to the ground.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut in this context I'm just going to read\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nan abridged version of those texts.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThis is a cryopreservation unit,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand it holds the bodies of the wife and mother\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nof cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwho hoped to be awoken one day to extended life\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin good health, with advancements in science and technology,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nall for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThis is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nundergoing hymenoplasty.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nHymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nallowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nregarding virginity and marriage.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nallowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto simulate the loss of virginity.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis is a jury simulation deliberation room,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand you can see beyond that two-way mirror\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\njury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd they observe deliberations\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nafter mock trial proceedings\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nso that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nto have the outcome that they're hoping for.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThis process costs 60,000 dollars.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\na contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nOn that table you can see 48 hours' worth\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nof seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThere is a pig's head and African cane rats.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd part of my photographic work\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nis I'm not just documenting what's there.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI do take certain liberties and intervene.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd in this I really wanted it to resemble\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nan early still-life painting,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nso I spent some time with the smells and items.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThis is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nin Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd the CIA has had a long history\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwith both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwas designed to counter Soviet communism\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand promote what it considered to be pro-American\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthoughts and aesthetics.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThis is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand on a six acre plot\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthere are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nthat are being studied by forensic anthropologists\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand researchers who are interested in monitoring\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\na rate of corpse decomposition.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd in this particular photograph the body of a young boy\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nhas been used to reenact a crime scene.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThis is the only federally funded site\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhere it is legal to cultivate cannabis\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nfor scientific research in the United States.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt's a research crop marijuana grow room.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd part of the work that I hope for\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nis that there is a sort of disorienting entropy\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhere you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthey sort of awkwardly jump from government to science\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nto religion to security --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand you can't completely understand\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nhow information is being distributed.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThese are transatlantic submarine communication cables\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nconnecting North America to Europe.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand in a lot of the government and technology sites\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthere was just this very apparent vulnerability.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThis one is almost humorous because it feels like I could\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\njust snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBut stuff did feel like it could have been taken\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\n30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand hadn't necessarily progressed.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThis is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd this is ... a division of the Library of Congress\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nproduces a free national library service\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nfor the blind and visually impaired,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand the publications they choose to publish\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nare based on reader popularity.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd Playboy is always in the top few.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs.

brass detailing,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand the painted acrylic facade.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIn the context of the film,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthis is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ncapable of annihilating planets and civilizations,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThis is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nIt's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nEssentially they've simulated a city\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nfor urban combat,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand this is one of the structures that exists in that city.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nIt's called the World Church of God.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIt's supposed to be a generic site of worship.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd after I took this photograph,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nthey constructed a wall around the World Church of God\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nto mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd I worked with Mehta Vihar\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwho creates virtual simulations for the army\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nfor tactical practice.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd we put that wall around the World Church of God,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand also used the characters and vehicles and explosions\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthat are offered in the video games for the army.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I put them into my photograph.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThis is live HIV virus\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nat Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nto develop sterilizing immunity.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nArabic language television

free.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nHowever, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nAnd in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nwhich specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand is broadcast to Iraq.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nNow I'm going to move on to another project I did.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt's titled \"The Innocents.\"\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd for the men in these photographs,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nphotography had been used to create a fantasy.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nContradicting its function as evidence of a truth,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nin these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nI traveled across the United States\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nphotographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nof crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nI investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand its influence on memory,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwhich can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nFor the men in these photographs,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nthe primary cause of their wrongful conviction\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nwas mistaken identification.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nA victim or eyewitness identifies\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\na suspected perpetrator\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nthrough law enforcement's use of images.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nBut through exposure to composite sketches,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nPolaroids, mug shots and line-ups,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\neyewitness testimony can change.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nI'll give you an example from a case.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nA woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nfrom which to identify her attacker.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nShe saw some similarities in one of the photographs,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nbut couldn't quite make a positive identification.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nDays later, she is presented with another photo array\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nof all new photographs,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nexcept that one photograph that she had some draw to\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nfrom the earlier array is repeated in the second array.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd a positive identification is made\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbecause the photograph replaced the memory,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nif there ever was an actual memory.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nPhotography offered the criminal justice system\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof relying on photographic identifications.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nFrederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhere 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nHe was convicted by an all-white jury\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nof rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd he served 10 years of a life sentence.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nNow DNA exonerated Frederick\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nand it also implicated another man\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwho was serving time in prison.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut the victim refused to press charges\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbecause she claimed that law enforcement\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nhad permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nCharles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nof a young girl walking to school.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nHe served 18 years of a death sentence.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nI photographed him at the scene of the crime\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nat the Snake River in Idaho.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nat sites that came to particular significance\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nin the history of their wrongful conviction.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthe alibi location.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd here, the scene of the crime, it's this place\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nto which he's never been, but changed his life forever.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo photographing there, I was hoping to highlight\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthe tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nin both his life and in photography.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nCalvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nHe served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nLarry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nwhere he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nin this very room to hide from the police.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nHe ended up serving 18 and a half years\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nof an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe victim failed to identify Larry\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nin two live lineups\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand then made a positive identification, days later,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nfrom a photo array.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nLarry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence\n\n00:15:05.958

Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us, and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive. Because of some of technologies we've been talking about. Because of the resources, the skills, and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world, with the mindset to create change. And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen, who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower, but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.And by definition, every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul, a global citizen. You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another. And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies. On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out. And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid. And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems. We call it patient capital.The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption? They use Mobutu as metaphor. And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable, focus on the capital markets, invest, don't give anything away.On the other side, as I said, there are those who say the problem is that we need more money. That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out and we'll hand a lot of aid, but when it comes to our poor brethren, we want little to do with it. They point to the successes of aid: the eradication of smallpox, and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals. Both sides are right. And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other. Even more problematic, they're not listening to poor people themselves.After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation, it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people. They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations. And so we need both the market and we need aid.Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both. It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact. It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons. First, they tend to work in markets where people make one, two, three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level. Second, the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure \u2014 no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption. Third, they are often creating markets.Even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages, it is something new. And so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time, takes a lot of patience. It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance. Not only to build the systems, the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way, but to connect those business to other markets, to governments, to corporations \u2014 real partnerships if we want to get to scale.I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation. In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India, who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet. And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether, despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day. They were creating subsidies either for large farms, or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use, rather than that the farmers wanted to use.At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel. It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant. And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green. But the market also had bypassed low income farmers, because these systems were both too expensive, and they were constructed for fields that were too large. The average small village farmer works on two acres or less.And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have. And he used three fundamental principles.The first one was miniaturization. The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake. Second, it had to be extremely affordable. In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk. And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable. What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight. In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants to research, to experiment, to fail, to innovate and try again. And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers, that's when patient capital could come in. And we helped him build a company, for profit, that would build on IDE's knowledge, and start looking at sales and exports, and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries. And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan. And while, again, you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan, just to get the permits, over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono, who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert, which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country. And though that company has just started, our assumption is that there too we'll see the impact on millions.But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation. We're starting to see these happening all around the world. In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us, with UNICEF, with the Global Fund, to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women. And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world.Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality, affordable maternal health care to low-income women, and it's been so successful that it's currently building a new hospital every 35 days.And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry, building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth, a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access, and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption. So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder, and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership. They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances, and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India.This idea of scale is critical. Because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people. But that's obviously not enough. And it's where the idea of partnership becomes so important. Whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets, government itself, or partner with major corporations, there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.President Obama understands that. He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country, and look at how we can scale it. And I would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations, not only for their country, but ones that we can use in the developed world as well. Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance. And then measure the returns, both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective.When we think about new approaches to aid, it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan. We've had a rocky relationship with that country and, in all fairness, the United States has not always been a very reliable partner. But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen. And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund, we could use this time to invest not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing, nor in international experts, but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country.People like Rashani Zafar, who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country, and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country. And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way called incremental housing, where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe, affordable community housing. Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country. It's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban.I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now, and those of you who've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population, and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. I would say that the converse is true. That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day, provide real pathways to hope. And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan, while we need to strengthen the judiciary, build greater stability, we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world.On one of my last visits to Pakistan, I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert. And we left Karachi one morning before dawn. It was about 115 degrees. And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color, lots of heat, very little discussion, because we were exhausted.And finally, at the end of the journey, I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon. And as we got closer, its significance became apparent. That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall. Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life. His name was Raja, and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father.And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day. Because he was building these crops. And with the money he earned he could stay this year. And for the first time ever in three generations, his children would go to school.We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons. And he said, \"Of course I will. Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\" When we think about solutions to poverty, we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity. Because at the end of the day, dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth. And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity. Because that is where dignity really starts.Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental, and that power without love is reckless and abusive. Our generation has seen both approaches tried, and often fail. But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power. For that is what we'll need, as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us, and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now. I can only talk from my own experience, but in eight years of running Acumen fund, I've seen the power of patient capital. Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking, but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet. I know it works. But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work, in whatever job you do, to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we're trying to help. Rather than what we think that they might need. It will take embracing the world with both arms. And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability, with a sense of integrity and perseverance. And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations. And there is so much good that we can do. Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert. Thank you.

And you've seen the best and the worst\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat human beings can do for one another and to one another.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd no matter what country you live or work in,\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nyou've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\neven in their most ordinariness.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nToday there is a raging debate\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nas to how best we lift people out of poverty,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nhow best we release their energies.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOn the one hand, we have people that say\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nthe aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd on the other we have people who say\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nthe problem is that we need more aid.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWe call it patient capital.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThe critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nin Africa since 1970\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand say, and what do we have but environmental degradation\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nThey use Mobutu as metaphor.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd their policy prescription is to\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nmake government more accountable,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nfocus on the capital markets,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\ninvest, don't give anything away.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nOn the other side, as I said, there are those who say\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthe problem is that we need more money.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThat when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand we'll hand a lot of aid,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nbut when it comes to our poor brethren,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nwe want little to do with it.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nThey point to the successes of aid:\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthe eradication of smallpox,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand the distribution of tens of millions\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nof malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nBoth sides are right.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nEven more problematic, they're not listening to\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\npoor people themselves.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAfter 25 years of working on issues of\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\npoverty and innovation,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nit's true that there are probably no more market-oriented\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nindividuals on the planet\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthan low-income people.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey must navigate markets daily,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nmaking micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nto move their way through society,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand yet if a single catastrophic health problem\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nimpacts their family,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthey could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd so we need both the market\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nand we need aid.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nPatient capital works between,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand tries to take the best of both.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nIt's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand are building solutions\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nto healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbut as individual customers, consumers, clients,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\npeople who want to make decisions in their own lives.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nPatient capital requires that we have\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nincredible tolerance for risk,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\na long time horizon in terms of allowing those\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nentrepreneurs time to experiment,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto use the market as the best listening device that we have,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand the expectation of below-market returns,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nbut outsized social impact.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIt recognizes that the market has its limitation,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand so patient capital also works\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwith smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nto include all people.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNow, entrepreneurs need patient capital\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nfor three reasons.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nFirst, they tend to work in markets\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwhere people make one, two, three dollars a day\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand they are making all of their decisions within that income level.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSecond, the geographies in which they work\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nhave terrible infrastructure --\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nno roads to speak of, sporadic electricity\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand high levels of corruption.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThird, they are often creating markets.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nEven if you're bringing clean water\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nfor the first time into rural villages, it is something new.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd so many low-income people\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nhave seen so many failed promises broken\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat building trust takes a lot of time,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ntakes a lot of patience.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nIt also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nNot only to build the systems,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthe business models that allow us\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto reach low income people in a sustainable way,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nbut to connect those business\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nto other markets, to governments, to corporations --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nreal partnerships if we want to get to scale.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nI want to share one story\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout an innovation called drip irrigation.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIn 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nnamed Amitabha Sadangi from India,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwho'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd he was expressing his frustration\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ndespite the fact that 200 million farmers\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nalone in India make under a dollar a day.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThey were creating subsidies\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\neither for large farms,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nor they were giving inputs to the farmers\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nthat they thought they should use, rather than\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat the farmers wanted to use.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAt the same time Amitabha was\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nobsessed with this drip irrigation technology\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat had been invented in Israel.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nIt was a way of bringing small amounts of water\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\ndirectly to the stalk of the plant.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd it could transform\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nswaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nBut the market also had bypassed low income farmers,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbecause these systems were both too expensive,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand they were constructed for fields that were too large.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThe average small village farmer\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nworks on two acres or less.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand he would redesign it from the perspective\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof the poor farmers themselves,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nbecause he spent so many years listening to what they needed\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nnot what he thought that they should have.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd he used three fundamental principles.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThe first one was miniaturization.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe drip irrigation system\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nhad to be small enough that a farmer only had\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nto risk a quarter acre,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\neven if he had two,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nbecause it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSecond, it had to be extremely affordable.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIn other words, that risk on the quarter acre\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nneeded to be repaid in a single harvest,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nor else they wouldn't take the risk.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd third, it had to be what Amitabha calls\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ninfinitely expandable.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWhat I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthe farmers could buy a second\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand a third and a fourth.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAs of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nhas sold over 300,000 farmers these systems\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand has seen their yields and incomes\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\ndouble or triple on average,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut this didn't happen overnight.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn fact, when you go back to the beginning,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nthere were no private investors\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwho would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nfor a market class that made under a dollar a day,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd so we needed grants. And he used significant grants\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nto research, to experiment, to fail,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto innovate and try again.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd when he had a prototype\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthat's when patient capital could come in.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd we helped him build a company, for profit,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat would build on IDE's knowledge,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand start looking at sales and exports,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand be able to tap into other kinds of capital.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSecondarily, we wanted to see if we could export\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthis drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd while, again, you needed patience\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto move a technology for the poor\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nin India into Pakistan,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\njust to get the permits,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nover time we were able to start a company\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwith Dr. Sono, who runs a large\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ncommunity development organization in the Thar Desert,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwhich is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd though that company has just started,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nour assumption is that there too\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nwe'll see the impact on millions.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nBut drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWe're starting to see these happening all around the world.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIn Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nhas worked in partnership with us,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwith UNICEF, with the Global Fund,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nto create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nfor Africans around the world.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nLifespring Hospital\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nto bring quality, affordable maternal health care\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nto low-income women,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand it's been so successful that it's currently building\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.958\na new hospital every 35 days.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nreinvent a completely broken industry,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbuilding an ambulance service in Bombay\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat would use the technology of Google Earth,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\na sliding scale pricing system\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nso that all people could have access,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand a severe and public decision\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nnot to engage in any form of corruption.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo that in the terrorist attacks of November\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nthey were the first responder,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThey've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nin India.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nThis idea of scale is critical.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBecause we're starting to see these enterprises\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nreach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nhave reached at least a quarter million people.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBut that's obviously not enough.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd it's where the idea of partnership\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nbecomes so important.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWhether it's by finding those innovations\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat can access the capital markets,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\ngovernment itself, or partner with major corporations,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthere is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nPresident Obama understands that.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nto focus on what works in this country,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand look at how we can scale it.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd I would submit that it's time to consider\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\na global innovation fund\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthat would find these entrepreneurs around the world\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwho really have innovations, not only for their country,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nbut ones that we can use in the developed world as well.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nInvest financial assistance, but also management assistance.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd then measure the returns,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nboth from a financial perspective\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand from a social impact perspective.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWhen we think about new approaches to aid,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nit's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nWe've had a rocky relationship with that country\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand, in all fairness,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthe United States has not always been a very reliable partner.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nBut again I would say that this is our moment\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nfor extraordinary things to happen.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwe could use this time to invest\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nnot directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nnor in international experts,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nbut in the many existing entrepreneurs\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand civil society leaders\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwho already are building wonderful innovations\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthat are reaching people all across the country.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nPeople like Rashani Zafar,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nwho created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\ncalled incremental housing,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhere he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\ninto safe, affordable community housing.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nEducational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nthat are building schools across the country.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's not hyperbole\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto say that these civil society institutions\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand these social entrepreneurs\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nare building real alternatives to the Taliban.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nI've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nand those of you who've also worked there\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ncan attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nPresident Kennedy said that\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nthose who make peaceful revolution impossible\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nmake violent revolution inevitable.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI would say that the converse is true.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThat these social leaders\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nwho really are looking at innovation\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand extending opportunity\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nto the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nprovide real pathways to hope.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nwhile we need to strengthen the judiciary,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbuild greater stability,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwe also need to think about lifting those leaders\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwho can be role models for the rest of the world.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nOn one of my last visits to Pakistan,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI asked Dr. Sono if he would take me\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd we left Karachi one morning before dawn.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt was about 115 degrees.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd we drove for eight hours\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nalong this moonscape-like landscape\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwith very little color, lots of heat,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nvery little discussion, because we were exhausted.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAnd finally, at the end of the journey,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nI could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd as we got closer, its significance became apparent.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThat there in the desert\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwas a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nBecause one of the poorest farmers on Earth\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nhad gotten access to a technology\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat had allowed him to change his own life.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nHis name was Raja,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand warm expressive hands\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat reminded me of my father.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd he said it was the first dry season\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nin his entire life that he hadn't taken\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nhis 12 children and 50 grandchildren\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\non a two day journey across the desert\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nto work as day laborers at a commercial farm\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nfor about 50 cents a day.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nBecause he was building these crops.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd with the money he earned he could stay this year.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd for the first time ever in three generations,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nhis children would go to school.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nWe asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd he said, \"Of course I will.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nBecause I don't want them discriminated against anymore.\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWhen we think about solutions to poverty,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwe cannot deny individuals\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\ntheir fundamental dignity.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBecause at the end of the day,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\ndignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nwho are building innovations that recognize\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthat what people want is freedom\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand choice and opportunity.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nBecause that is where dignity really starts.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nMartin Luther King said that\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nlove without power is anemic and sentimental,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nand that power without love\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nis reckless and abusive.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nOur generation has seen both approaches tried,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nand often fail.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBut I think our generation also might be the first\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto have the courage to embrace both love and power.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nFor that is what we'll need, as we move forward\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nto dream and imagine what it will really take\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nto build a global economy that includes all of us,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand to finally extend that fundamental proposition\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthat all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThe time for us to begin innovating\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nI can only talk from my own experience,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbut in eight years of running Acumen fund,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nI've seen the power of patient capital.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nNot only to inspire innovation and risk taking,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nbut to truly build systems that have created\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nmore than 25,000 jobs\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand delivered tens of millions of services and products\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nto some of the poorest people on the planet.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nI know it works.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nBut I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nin whatever job you do,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nto start thinking about how we might\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nbuild solutions that start\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nfrom the perspective of those we're trying to help.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nRather than what we think that they might need.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nIt will take embracing the world with both arms.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAnd it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nwith a sense of integrity and perseverance.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd yet these are the very qualities\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nfor which men and women have been honored\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nthroughout the generations.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd there is so much good that we can do.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nJust think of all those sunflowers in the desert.\n\n00:16:51.958 -->

Before you answer that, have a look at this map. Contemporary political map shows that we have over 200 countries in the world today. That's probably more than at any time in centuries. Now, many of you will object. For you this would be a more appropriate map. You could call it TEDistan. In TEDistan, there are no borders, just connected spaces and unconnected spaces. Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots on this screen, of the many more that represent 90 percent of the world economy.But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population that will never leave the place in which they were born. For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal, and often violently. Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe. Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved: our basic political geography. How do we distribute ourselves around the world?Now this is important, because border conflicts justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex. Border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here. So I think we need a deeper understanding of how people, money, power, religion, culture, technology interact to change the map of the world. And we can try to anticipate those changes, and shape them in a more constructive direction.So we're going to look at some maps of the past, the present and some maps you haven't seen in order to get a sense of where things are going. Let's start with the world of 1945. 1945 there were just 100 countries in the world. After World War II, Europe was devastated, but still held large overseas colonies: French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth. Then over the late '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s, waves of decolonization took place. Over 50 new countries were born. You can see that Africa has been fragmented. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created. Then came the end of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe, the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans, and the 'stans of central Asia.Today we have 200 countries in the world. The entire planet is covered by sovereign, independent nation-states. Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss? Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world, Eastern Eurasia. As you can see on this map, Russia is still the largest country in the world. And as you know, China is the most populous. And they share a lengthy land border.What you don't see on this map is that most of Russia's 150 million people are concentrated in its western provinces and areas that are close to Europe. And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas. In fact, the World Bank predicts that Russia's population is declining towards about 120 million peopleAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map. Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders forced Russians out to the far east to be in gulags, labor camps, nuclear cities, whatever the case was. But as oil prices rose, Russian governments have invested in infrastructure to unite the country, east and west. But nothing has more perversely impacted Russia's demographic distribution, because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway, have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west. As a result, in the Russian far east today, which is twice the size of India, you have exactly six million Russians.So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world. We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia. Why do they call it that? Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate and own most of the mines \u2014 copper, zinc, gold \u2014 and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China. China isn't conquering Mongolia. It's buying it. Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.So let's apply this principle to Siberia. Siberia most of you probably think of as a cold, desolate, unlivable place. But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures, all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia. But who is it going to feed? Well, just on the other side of the Amo River, in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China, you have over 100 million people. That's larger than the entire population of Russia.Every single year, for at least a decade or more, [60,000] of them have been voting with their feet, crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain. They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics. They've taken over the timber industry and been shipping the lumber east, back into China. Again, like Mongolia, China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it. That's what I call globalization Chinese style.Now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years. But hold on. This map is 700 years old. This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it does rhyme.This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world. Again, globalization Chinese style. Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography. So, the history of East Asia in fact, people don't think about nations and borders. They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies, usually Chinese or Japanese.Well it's China's turn again. So let's look at how China is re-establishing that hierarchy in the far East. It starts with the global hubs. Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map that show the hubs of the global economy? East Asia today has more of those global hubs than any other region in the world. Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney. These are the filters and funnels of global capital. Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region, so much of it being invested into China.Then there is trade. These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger trade relationships that China has with every country in the region. Specifically, it targets Japan and Korea and Australia, countries that are strong allies of the United States. Australia, for example, is heavily dependent on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China. For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply and become dependent on exporting to China as well.And now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to China to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world. The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific. So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy. China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region. It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions such as the East Asian Community. Some of these organizations don't even have the United States as a member. There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries, such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States, most countries vow to just sit it out, including American allies like Korea and Australia.Another pillar of the strategy, like Russia, is demographic. China exports business people, nannies, students, teachers to teach Chinese around the region, to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies. Already ethnic Chinese people in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia are the real key factors and drivers in the economies there. Chinese pride is resurgent in the region as a result. Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education. Now it encourages it.If you add it all up what do you get? Well, if you remember before World War II, Japan had a vision for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere. What's emerging today is what you might call a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere. So no matter what the lines on the map tell you in terms of nations and borders, what you really have emerging in the far east are national cultures, but in a much more fluid, imperial zone. All of this is happening without firing a shot.That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East where countries are still very uncomfortable in the borders left behind by European colonialists. So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world? What lines on the map should we focus on? What I want to present to you is what I call state building, day by day.Let's start with Iraq. Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality. Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together; now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration. The reason is Kurdistan. The Kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence, and now is their chance to finally have it. These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan, which is an oil-rich region.And today, if you go to Kurdistan, you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army. But what are they guarding? Is it really a border on the map? No. It's the pipelines. If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms of their own statehood. Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq? I don't believe we should. Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world, behind Saudi Arabia. And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute. Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked. It has no choice but to behave. In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria, and other countries, and Iraq itself. And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region. That is, of course, in Palestine. Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel. 30 years of rose garden diplomacy have not delivered us peace in this conflict. What might? I believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure. Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this. These two arrows are an arc, an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure that link the West Bank and Gaza.If Gaza can have a functioning port and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state, Palestinian economy. That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict. The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine is that independence alone, without infrastructure, is futile.Now what might this entire region look like if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders, when the insecurities might abate? The last time that was the case was actually a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire. This is the Hejaz Railway. The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus. It even had an offshoot running to Haifa in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea. But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins. If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map, infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders, I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.Now let's look at another part of the world, the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans. These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees. He purposely did not want these countries to make sense. He wanted ethnicities to mingle in ways that would allow him to divide and rule. Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.Now I know some of you may be thinking, \"Oil, oil, oil. Why is it all he's talking about is oil?\" Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now. Before it was, how do we control their oil? Now it's their oil for their own purposes. And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists. Here are just some of the pipeline projections and possibilities and scenarios and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades. A great deal of them.For a number of countries in this part of the world, having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy and for having some meaning besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves. Just take Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses, but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey, it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of as a frozen basket case. But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea to provide for Europe, and even a potentially Turkmen- Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before. It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union. Today most people recognize Kazakhstan as an emerging geopolitical player. Why? Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian, north through Russia, and even east to China. More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game. The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other. Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust. The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have, and the less of a dominant Great Game competition we'll have in the 21st century.Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders, and how that has enhanced its strength. And that is, of course, Europe. The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries, and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany to happen in a peaceful way. But then eventually it grew into 12 countries, and those are the 12 stars on the European flag. The E.U. also became a currency block, and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world. On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year since the end of the Cold War. In fact most of that happened on just one day. In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U. and now you have what most people consider a zone of peace spanning 27 countries and 450 million people.So what is next? What is the future of the European Union? Well in light blue, you see the zones or the regions that are at least two-thirds or more dependent on the European Union for trade and investment. What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is. Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U., they are becoming part of its sphere of influence. Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet. But you can get on a German ICE train and make it almost to Albania. In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already, and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa. On average, every year or two, a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean, connecting North Africa to Europe. That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance on Russia for energy, but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East. So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus. I mentioned Azerbaijan before. That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus has become the conduit for 20 percent of Europe's energy supply. So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union? I don't think it does. I think it's already part of a Euro-Turkish superpower.So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change and new countries born? Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia is a very good place to start. Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan there is still a tremendous amount of instability. Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of Pashtun nationalism. This is the flag that flies in the minds of 20 million Pashtuns who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south, Balochistan. Two weeks ago, Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison, and this was the flag that they raised over it. The post-colonial entropy that is happening around the world is accelerating, and I expect more such changes to occur in the map as the states fragment.Of course, we can't forget Africa. 53 countries, and by far the most number of suspiciously straight lines on the map. If we were to look at all of Africa we could most certainly acknowledge far more, tribal divisions and so forth. But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa. It has three ongoing civil wars, the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about, the civil war in the east of the country, and south Sudan. South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011 in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle. There is a great race on for energy resources under the Arctic seabed. Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States? Actually Greenland. Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people voted themselves self-governance rights from Denmark. So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.What is the lesson from all of this? Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline. It's constantly morphing and changing the world, like climate change. And like our relationship with the ecosystem we're always searching for equilibrium in how we divide ourselves across the planet. Now we fear changes on the map. We fear civil wars, death tolls, having to learn the names of new countries. But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today is far worse and far more violent.The question is how do we change those borders, and what lines do we focus on? I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders, the infrastructure lines. Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one. Thank you.

million people are in its eastern areas.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nIn fact, the World Bank predicts\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthat Russia's population is declining\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\ntowards about 120 million people\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd there is another thing that you don't see on this map.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nStalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nforced Russians out to the far east\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto be in gulags, labor camps,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nnuclear cities, whatever the case was.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBut as oil prices rose,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nRussian governments have invested in infrastructure\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto unite the country, east and west.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut nothing has more perversely impacted\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nRussia's demographic distribution,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nhave gotten on those trains and roads\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand gone back to the west.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAs a result, in the Russian far east today,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhich is twice the size of India,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nyou have exactly six million Russians.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nSo let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nWe can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWhy do they call it that?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBecause in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nChina isn't conquering Mongolia.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's buying it.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nColonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nSo let's apply this principle to Siberia.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nSiberia most of you probably think of\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nas a cold, desolate, unlivable place.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nall of a sudden you have vast wheat fields\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nBut who is it going to feed?\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nWell, just on the other side of the Amo River,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nin the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nyou have over 100 million people.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThat's larger than the entire population of Russia.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nEvery single year, for at least a decade or more,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ncrossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThey set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThey've taken over the timber industry\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand been shipping the lumber east, back into China.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAgain, like Mongolia,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nChina isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThat's what I call globalization Chinese style.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nNow maybe this is what the map of the region\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nmight look like in 10 to 20 years.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nBut hold on. This map is 700 years old.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThis is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nled by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut it does rhyme.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThis is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAgain, globalization Chinese style.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBecause globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nundermine and change the way we think about political geography.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, the history of East Asia in fact,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\npeople don't think about nations and borders.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThey think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nusually Chinese or Japanese.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nWell it's China's turn again.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nSo let's look at how China is re-establishing\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nthat hierarchy in the far East.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIt starts with the global hubs.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nRemember the 40 dots on the nighttime map\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat show the hubs of the global economy?\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nEast Asia today has more of those global hubs\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthan any other region in the world.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nTokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThese are the filters and funnels of global capital.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nTrillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nso much of it being invested into China.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThen there is trade.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThese vectors and arrows represent ever stronger\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\ntrade relationships that China has\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwith every country in the region.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSpecifically, it targets Japan\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand Korea and Australia,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ncountries that are strong allies of the United States.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nAustralia, for example, is heavily dependent\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\non exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nFor poorer countries, China reduces tariffs\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nso that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nand become dependent on exporting to China as well.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd now many of you have been reading in the news\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nhow people are looking to China\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nto lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nnow has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnother pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nChina has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIt has become the hub of diplomatic institutions\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nsuch as the East Asian Community.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSome of these organizations don't even have\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe United States as a member.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThere is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nsuch that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nmost countries vow to just sit it out,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nincluding American allies like Korea and Australia.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnother pillar of the strategy,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nlike Russia, is demographic.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nChina exports business people, nannies, students,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nteachers to teach Chinese around the region,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nto intermarry and to occupy ever greater\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\ncommanding heights of the economies.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAlready ethnic Chinese people\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nin Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nare the real key factors and drivers\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nin the economies there.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nChinese pride is resurgent in the region\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nas a result.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSingapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow it encourages it.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIf you add it all up what do you get?\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWell, if you remember before World War II,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nJapan had a vision\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nfor a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWhat's emerging today is what you might call\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\na greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo no matter what the lines on the map tell you\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nin terms of nations and borders,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nwhat you really have emerging in the far east\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nare national cultures,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nbut in a much more fluid, imperial zone.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAll of this is happening without firing a shot.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThat's most certainly not the case in the Middle East\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nwhere countries are still very uncomfortable\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the borders left behind by European colonialists.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhat lines on the map should we focus on?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWhat I want to present to you is what I call\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nstate building, day by day.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nLet's start with Iraq.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSix years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthe country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nOil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nnow it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThe reason is Kurdistan.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nThe Kurds for 3,000 years\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nhave been waging a struggle for independence,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand now is their chance to finally have it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThese are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nwhich is an oil-rich region.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd today, if you go to Kurdistan,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nyou'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nare squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBut what are they guarding?\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nIs it really a border on the map?\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nNo. It's the pipelines.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIf the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nof their own statehood.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nNow should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nI don't believe we should.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nIraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nbehind Saudi Arabia.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow remember Kurdistan is landlocked.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt has no choice but to behave.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nIn order to profit from its oil\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nit has to export it through Turkey or Syria,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nand other countries, and Iraq itself.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nAnd therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nNow lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat is, of course, in Palestine.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nPalestine is something of a cartographic anomaly\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\n30 years of rose garden diplomacy\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nhave not delivered us peace in this conflict.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nWhat might? I believe that what might\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nsolve the problem is infrastructure.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nToday donors are spending billions of dollars on this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThese two arrows are an arc,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nan arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat link the West Bank and Gaza.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIf Gaza can have a functioning port\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nPalestinian economy.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThat, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThe lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nis that independence alone, without infrastructure,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nis futile.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNow what might this entire region look like\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nif in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwhen the insecurities might abate?\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThe last time that was the case was actually\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\na century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThis is the Hejaz Railway.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThe Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nIt even had an offshoot running to Haifa\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nin what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nBut today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nIf we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\ninfrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow let's look at another part of the world,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nthe former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nThese countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nHe purposely did not want these countries to make sense.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nHe wanted ethnicities to mingle\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nin ways that would allow him to divide and rule.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nFortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nwere discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nNow I know some of you may be thinking, \"Oil, oil, oil.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWhy is it all he's talking about is oil?\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand the way we're talking about it now.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nBefore it was, how do we control their oil?\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow it's their oil for their own purposes.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd I assure you it's every bit as important to them\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nas it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHere are just some of the pipeline projections\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand possibilities and scenarios\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nA great deal of them.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nFor a number of countries in this part of the world,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nhaving pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand for having some meaning\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbesides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nJust take Azerbaijan.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAzerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nbut now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nit has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThen there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nas a frozen basket case.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nto provide for Europe,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nand even a potentially Turkmen-\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAfghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThen there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nIt was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nToday most people recognize Kazakhstan\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nas an emerging geopolitical player. Why?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nBecause it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nnorth through Russia, and even east to China.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nMore pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThe Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nSilk road connotes independence and mutual trust.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThe more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand the less of a dominant Great Game competition\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nwe'll have in the 21st century.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nNow let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand how that has enhanced its strength.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd that is, of course, Europe.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThe European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nand their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nto happen in a peaceful way.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut then eventually it grew into 12 countries,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand those are the 12 stars on the European flag.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThe E.U. also became a currency block,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nOn average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nsince the end of the Cold War.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nIn fact most of that happened on just one day.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIn 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand now you have what most people consider\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\na zone of peace spanning 27 countries\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand 450 million people.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo what is next? What is the future of the European Union?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nWell in light blue, you see the zones\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nor the regions that are at least two-thirds\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nor more dependent on the European Union\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nfor trade and investment.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nWhat does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthat Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nEven if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthey are becoming part of its sphere of influence.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nJust take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nBosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut you can get on a German ICE train\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand make it almost to Albania.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIn Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nOn average, every year or two,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\na new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nconnecting North Africa to Europe.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nThat not only helps Europe diminish its reliance\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\non Russia for energy,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthat they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nSo in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nis right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nNow let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nI mentioned Azerbaijan before.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThat corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nhas become the conduit for 20 percent\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nof Europe's energy supply.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nSo does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nI don't think it does. I think it's already part of\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\na Euro-Turkish superpower.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nSo what's next? Where are we going to see borders change\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nand new countries born?\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWell, South Central Asia, South West Asia\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nis a very good place to start.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nEight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthere is still a tremendous amount of instability.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nPakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nthat neither of them have dealt constructively\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nwith the problem of Pashtun nationalism.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nThis is the flag that flies in the minds\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nof 20 million Pashtuns\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nwho live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nLet's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nBalochistan. Two weeks ago,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nBalochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand this was the flag that they raised over it.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nThe post-colonial entropy\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nthat is happening around the world is accelerating,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nand I expect more such changes to occur in the map\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nas the states fragment.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nOf course, we can't forget Africa.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\n53 countries, and by far the most number\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nof suspiciously straight lines on the map.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nIf we were to look at all of Africa\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nwe could most certainly acknowledge far more,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\ntribal divisions and so forth.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nBut let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nIt has three ongoing civil wars,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nthe genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nthe civil war in the east of the country,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand south Sudan.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nSouth Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nin which it is very likely to vote itself independence.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nNow let's go up to the Arctic Circle.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nThere is a great race on for energy resources\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nunder the Arctic seabed.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nWho will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nActually Greenland.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nSeveral weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nvoted themselves self-governance rights\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nfrom Denmark.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nSo Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nWhat is the lesson from all of this?\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nGeopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nIt's constantly morphing and changing the world,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nlike climate change.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nAnd like our relationship with the ecosystem\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nwe're always searching for equilibrium\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nin how we divide ourselves across the planet.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nNow we fear changes on the map.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nWe fear civil wars, death tolls,\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nhaving to learn the names of new countries.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nBut I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nis far worse and far more violent.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nThe question is how do we change those borders,\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand what lines do we focus on?\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nI believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nthe infrastructure lines.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThen we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:44.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Designers -- think big!", "duration": "1010", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_brown_urges_designers_to_think_big", "transcript": "I'd like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking. Now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project I was ever hired to do, something like 25 years ago. It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one, and my task was to make this thing a little bit more modern, a little bit easier to use. I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job. Unfortunately, not very long afterwards the company went out of business.This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine. I put an attractive shell around some new technology. Again, 18 months later, the product was obsolete. And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete. Now, I'm a fairly slow learner, but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn't all that important \u2014 making things more attractive, making them a bit easier to use, making them more marketable. By focusing on a design, maybe just a single product, I was being incremental and not having much of an impact.But I think this small view of design is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century as design became a tool of consumerism. So when we talk about design today, and particularly when we read about it in the popular press, we're often talking about products like these. Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe. Important? Not so very.But this wasn't always the way. And I'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design, and focus less on the object and more on design thinking as an approach, that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact. Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, designed many great things in his career in the 19th century, including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe. Both great designs and actually very innovative too. His greatest creation runs actually right through here in Oxford. It's called the Great Western Railway.And as a kid I grew up very close to here, and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past. You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting, \"Rain, Steam and Speed\". Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers was the experience of floating across the countryside.Now, this was back in the 19th century. And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made, which meant building long viaducts across river valleys \u2014 this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead \u2014 and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire. But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey. He imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in London and disembark from a ship in New York. One journey from London to New York. This is the S.S. Great Western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey.Now, Brunel was working 100 years before the emergence of the design profession, but I think he was using design thinking to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations. Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin, the business school professor at the University of Toronto, calls integrative thinking. And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions. In the case of design, that means balancing desirability, what humans need, with technical feasibility, and economic viability. With innovations like the Great Western, we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.So somehow, we went from this to this. Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world, to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things. As our industrial society matured, so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics, image and fashion. Now I'm not trying to throw stones here. I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood, and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses. There we go. But I do think that perhaps design is getting big again. And that's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems \u2014 to global warming, to education, healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems, there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful. And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes. The first of those is that design is human-centered. It may integrate technology and economics, but it starts with what humans need, or might need. What makes life easier, more enjoyable? What makes technology useful and usable? But that is more than simply good ergonomics, putting the buttons in the right place. It's often about understanding culture and context before we even know where to start to have ideas.So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India, they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents. Conversion Sound has developed a high quality, ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world. Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians to fit these hearing aids. In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist. So it took a team working in India with patients and community health workers to understand how a PDA and an application on a PDA might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service.Instead of starting with technology, the team started with people and culture. So if human need is the place to start, then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making. Instead of thinking about what to build, building in order to think. Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation, because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses. And the faster we do that, the faster our ideas evolve.Now, much has been said and written about the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India. They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay to cross-subsidize those who cannot. Now, they are very efficient, but they are also very innovative. When I visited them a few years ago, what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early.This is the manufacturing facility for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs. They make their own intraocular lenses. These are the lenses that replace those that are damaged by cataracts. And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough. Because they brought the cost down from $200 a pair, down to just $4 a pair. Partly they did this by instead of building a fancy new factory, they used the basement of one of their hospitals. And instead of installing the large-scale machines used by western producers, they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology. They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world and have recently moved into a custom factory.So if human need is the place to start, and prototyping, a vehicle for progress, then there are also some questions to ask about the destination. Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption, design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation \u2014 the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful, productive and profitable.So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about, this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things, and take that a little bit further and say that I think the design of participatory systems, in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured, is going to be the major theme, not only for design, but also for our economy as we go forward.So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942, created what became Britain's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well-being. By the time he wrote his third report, he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater, and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation, and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0, they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state. So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle, they worked with residents in Southwark, South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks. Designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year.We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone. Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system Kaiser Permanente study the topic of improving the patient experience, and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift. Through a program of observational research, brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping, they've developed a completely new way to change shift.They went from retreating to the nurse's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients, to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients, using a simple software tool. By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average. They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness. When you multiply that by all the nurses in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system, it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.And this is just one of thousands of opportunities in healthcare alone. So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they're being applied to. But I'd like to go back to Brunel here, and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now, and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool. And that connection is change. In times of change we need new alternatives, new ideas.Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution, when all of life and our economy was being reinvented. Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course, and indeed they are part of the problem today. But, again, we are in the midst of massive change. And that change is forcing us to question quite fundamental aspects of our society \u2014 how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves, how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure. And in these times of change, we need these new choices because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.So why design thinking? Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems. Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach where we make the best choice out of available alternatives, it encourages us to take a divergent approach, to explore new alternatives, new solutions, new ideas that have not existed before. But before we go through that process of divergence, there is actually quite an important first step. And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer? What's the design brief? Now Brunel may have asked a question like this, \"How do I take a train from London to New York?\" But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently. And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund, in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. How might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world's poorest people, and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers?So instead of having a bunch of American designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate, we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach. We teamed designers and investment experts up with 11 water organizations across India. And through workshops they developed innovative new products, services, and business models.We hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations to develop their ideas. So they developed and iterated these ideas. And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns, community outreach strategies, business models, new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water. Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market. And the same process is just getting underway with NGOs in East Africa.So for me, this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that I was working on at the beginning of my career. That by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly, by getting the process out of the hands of designers, and by getting the active participation of the community, we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions. And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems, we can have a bigger impact. So that's one thing that we've been working on.I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on. What kinds of questions do we think design thinking could be used to tackle? And if you've got any ideas then feel free, you can post them to Twitter. There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ. And the list looked something like this a little while ago. And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in by using the same hash code.So I'd like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference, that it can help create new ideas and new innovations, beyond the latest High Street products. To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design, more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood. And the first step is to start asking the right questions. Thank you very much.

It's a fax machine.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nI put an attractive shell around some new technology.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAgain, 18 months later,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nthe product was obsolete.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, I'm a fairly slow learner,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nbut eventually it occurred to me that\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nmaybe what passed for design\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nwasn't all that important --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nmaking things more attractive,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nmaking them a bit easier to use,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nmaking them more marketable.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBy focusing on a design,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nmaybe just a single product,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI was being incremental\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand not having much of an impact.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nBut I think this small view of design\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nis a relatively recent phenomenon,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand in fact really emerged\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nin the latter half of the 20th century\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nas design became a tool of consumerism.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nSo when we talk about design today,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand particularly when we read about it in the popular press,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwe're often talking about products like these.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAmusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nImportant? Not so very.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nBut this wasn't always the way.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd I'd like to suggest that if we take\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\na different view of design,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand focus less on the object\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand more on design thinking as an approach,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthat we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNow this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\ndesigned many great things in his career in the 19th century,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nincluding the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nBoth great designs and actually very innovative too.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nHis greatest creation\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nruns actually right through here in Oxford.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt's called the Great Western Railway.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd as a kid I grew up very close to here,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand one of my favorite things to do\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwas to cycle along by the side of the railway\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwaiting for the great big express trains to roar past.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nYou can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n\"Rain, Steam and Speed\".\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwas the experience of floating across the countryside.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nNow, this was back in the 19th century.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd to do that meant creating the flattest gradients\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat had ever yet been made,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich meant building long viaducts across river valleys --\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nthis is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nBut he didn't stop there. He didn't stop\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwith just trying to design the best railway journey.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nHe imagined an integrated transportation system\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nin which it would be possible for a passenger to embark\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\non a train in London\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand disembark from a ship in New York.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nOne journey from London to New York.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThis is the S.S. Great Western that he built\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nto take care of the second half of that journey.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, Brunel was working 100 years before\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthe emergence of the design profession,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nbut I think he was using design thinking\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nto solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nNow, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nthe business school professor at the University of Toronto,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\ncalls integrative thinking.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand opposing constraints\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nto create new solutions.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nIn the case of design, that means\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nbalancing desirability, what humans need,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwith technical feasibility,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand economic viability.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nWith innovations like the Great Western,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwe can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo somehow, we went from this to this.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSystems thinkers who were reinventing the world,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nto a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nworking on small things.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAs our industrial society matured,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nso design became a profession\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand it focused on an ever smaller canvas\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nuntil it came to stand for aesthetics,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nimage and fashion.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow I'm not trying to throw stones here.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nI'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nThere we go.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut I do think that perhaps design\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nis getting big again.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd that's happening through\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthe application of design thinking\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nto new kinds of problems --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nto global warming, to education,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nhealthcare, security, clean water, whatever.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd as we see this reemergence of design thinking\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthere are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd I'd like to talk about some of those\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\njust for the next few minutes.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe first of those is that design is\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nhuman-centered.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nIt may integrate technology and economics,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nbut it starts with what humans need, or might need.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nWhat makes life easier, more enjoyable?\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWhat makes technology useful and usable?\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nBut that is more than simply good ergonomics,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nputting the buttons in the right place.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIt's often about understanding culture and context\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbefore we even know where to start to have ideas.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nthey wanted to understand what the aspirations\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand motivations were of these school children\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto understand how they might play a role\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nin screening their parents.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nConversion Sound has developed a high quality,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nultra-low-cost digital hearing aid\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfor the developing world.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nNow, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nto fit these hearing aids.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nSo it took a team working in India\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwith patients and community health workers\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nto understand how a PDA\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand an application on a PDA\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nmight replace those technicians\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nin a fitting and diagnostic service.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nInstead of starting with technology,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthe team started with people and culture.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo if human need is the place to start,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthen design thinking rapidly moves on to\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nlearning by making.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nInstead of thinking about what to build,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbuilding in order to think.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nNow, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbecause it is only when we put our ideas out into the world\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthat we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd the faster we do that,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthe faster our ideas evolve.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nNow, much has been said and written about\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthe Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThey do an incredible job of serving very poor patients\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nby taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nto cross-subsidize those who cannot.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nNow, they are very efficient,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nbut they are also very innovative.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nWhen I visited them a few years ago,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwhat really impressed me was their willingness\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nto prototype their ideas very early.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThis is the manufacturing facility\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfor one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThey make their own intraocular lenses.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThese are the lenses that replace those\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthat are damaged by cataracts.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd I think it's partly their prototyping mentality\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nBecause they brought the cost down\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nfrom $200 a pair,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ndown to just $4 a pair.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nPartly they did this by instead of building\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\na fancy new factory,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthey used the basement of one of their hospitals.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd instead of installing the large-scale machines\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nused by western producers,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthey used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThey are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nand have recently moved into a custom factory.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo if human need is the place to start,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand prototyping, a vehicle for progress,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nthen there are also some questions to ask about the destination.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nInstead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ndesign thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthe shift from a passive relationship\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nbetween consumer and producer\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nto the active engagement of everyone\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nin experiences that are meaningful,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nproductive and profitable.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthis notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand take that a little bit further and say that\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI think the design of participatory systems,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nin which many more forms of value\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbeyond simply cash\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nare both created and measured,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nis going to be the major theme, not only for design,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbut also for our economy as we go forward.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ncreated what became Britain's welfare state\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nin which he hoped that every citizen\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwould be an active participant\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin their own social well-being.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBy the time he wrote his third report,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nhe confessed that he had failed\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand instead had created a society of welfare consumers.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nHilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand Hugo Manassei of Participle\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nhave taken this idea of participation,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthey are suggesting a framework\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nfor reinventing the welfare state.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSo in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthey worked with residents in Southwark, South London\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand a small team of designers\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nto develop a new membership organization\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nto help the elderly with household tasks.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nDesigns were refined and developed\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwith 150 older people and their families\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbefore the service was launched earlier this year.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nWe can take this idea of participation\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nperhaps to its logical conclusion\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nand say that design may have its greatest impact\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhen it's taken out of the hands of designers\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand put into the hands of everyone.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nNurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nKaiser Permanente\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nstudy the topic of improving the patient experience,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand change shift.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nThrough a program of observational research,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbrainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthey've developed a completely new way to change shift.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThey went from retreating to the nurse's station\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nto discuss the various states and needs of patients,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nto developing a system that happened on the ward\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nin front of patients, using a simple software tool.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nBy doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\ndown from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThey increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWhen you multiply that by all the nurses\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nit resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd this is just one of thousands\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nof opportunities in healthcare alone.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo these are just some of the kind of basic ideas\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\naround design thinking\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand some of the new kinds of projects\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthat they're being applied to.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut I'd like to go back to Brunel here,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd that connection is change.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIn times of change we need\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nnew alternatives, new ideas.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhen all of life and our economy\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nwas being reinvented.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nNow the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand indeed they are part of the problem today.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nBut, again, we are in the midst of massive change.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd that change is forcing us to question\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nquite fundamental aspects of our society --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhow we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nhow we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd in these times of change, we need these new choices\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbecause our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo why design thinking?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nBecause it gives us a new way of tackling problems.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nInstead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwhere we make the best choice out of available alternatives,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nit encourages us to take a divergent approach,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nto explore new alternatives, new solutions,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nnew ideas that have not existed before.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nBut before we go through that process of divergence,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthere is actually quite an important first step.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nWhat's the design brief?\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nNow Brunel may have asked a question like this,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\n\"How do I take a train from London to New York?\"\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nBut what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nSo these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nHow might we improve access to safe drinking water\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nfor the world's poorest people,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand at the same time stimulate innovation\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\namongst local water providers?\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo instead of having a bunch of American designers\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ncome up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwe took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe teamed designers and investment experts up with\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n11 water organizations across India.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd through workshops they developed\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ninnovative new products, services, and business models.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe hosted a competition\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand then funded five of those organizations\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nto develop their ideas.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nSo they developed and iterated these ideas.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAnd then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nto help design new social marketing campaigns,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\ncommunity outreach strategies, business models,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nnew water vessels for storing water\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand carts for delivering water.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSome of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd the same process is just getting underway\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nwith NGOs in East Africa.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nSo for me, this project shows\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nkind of how far we can go from\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nsome of those sort of small things\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nthat I was working on\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nat the beginning of my career.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThat by focusing on the needs of humans\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nand by using prototypes\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nto move ideas along quickly,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nby getting the process out of the hands of designers,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand by getting the active participation of the community,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nwe can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nwe can have a bigger impact.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nSo that's one thing that we've been working on.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto know what this community thinks we could work on.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWhat kinds of questions do we think\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\ndesign thinking could be used to tackle?\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd if you've got any ideas\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthen feel free, you can post them to Twitter.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nThere is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd the list looked something like this a little while ago.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nby using the same hash code.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nSo I'd like to believe that design thinking\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nactually can make a

been feeling frustrated, because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths. Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule. Sometimes it comes in a positive version \u2014 \"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.\" And equally important is the negative version \u2014 \"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.\" Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works. People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said, \"all day and every day,\" not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism, but to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself. And it brings you into the presence of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao. Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence.But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time, that this was so central to the religious life. Because with a few wonderful exceptions, very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort. Often people don't really want to be compassionate. I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead. And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.Now why was I so grateful to TED? Because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived. Because I feel an urgency about this. If we don't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally, so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves, I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.The task of our time, one of the great tasks of our time, is to build a global society, as I said, where people can live together in peace. And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem. And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule. This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.And so we have a choice, it seems to me. We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can go back to the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus, who, when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg, said, \"That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary.\"And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate. And we need to revive that spirit. And it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down. We have to make this happen, and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced. Already I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.In Singapore, we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society, and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically. In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people, young people, and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art. Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions, are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths.But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch. Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines. Religious teaching must always lead to action. And I intend to work on this till my dying day. And I want to continue with our partners to do two things \u2014 educate and stimulate compassionate thinking. Education because we've so dropped out of compassion. People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody. But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it. You also have to do it.I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people, which are dividing us from one another. The same applies to educators. I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle. And also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions. And perhaps above all, to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking, so that because people have this Charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them, they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders, from the captains of industry. Because we can change the world, we have the ability.I would never have thought of putting the Charter online. I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement. And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas. Because that is what is so wonderful about TED. In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together, we could change the world. And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author whom I don't quote very often, C.S. Lewis. But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl. It's in his book \"The Four Loves.\" He said that he distinguished between erotic love, when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes. And then he compared that to friendship, when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder, with their eyes fixed on a common goal.We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends. And I am convinced. I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey, that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences melt away. And we learn amity. And we learn to live together and to get to know one another. Thank you very much.

I'm a spectroscopist. I have to talk about astronomy without showing you any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc. because my job is spectroscopy. I never deal with images. But I'll try to convince you that spectroscopy is actually something which can change this world. Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, \"Is there anybody out there?\" Are we alone? SETI. It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.One of my colleagues in Bulgaria, Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years studying these profiles. And she published 42 articles just dedicated to the subject. Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking, observing, the same star for 20 years is incredible. But we are crazy. We do these things. (Laughter)And I'm not that far. I spent about eight months working on these profiles. Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars. And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star, which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet. Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars. But you have it in planets and asteroids. So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids, you will have this Lithium-6 isotope in the spectrum of the star. So I invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star.And actually it's amazing, because I got phone calls from many reporters asking, \"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?\" Because they thought that if you are having a telescope, you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope. And you might have seen the planet going into a star. And I was saying, \"No, excuse me. What I see is this one.\" (Laughter) It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really. I bet that there were very few people who really understood what I'm talking about. Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star. It's amazing.The power of spectroscopy was actually realized by Pink Floyd already in 1973. (Laughter) Because they actually said that you can get any color you like in a spectrum. And all you need is time and money to make your spectrograph. This is the number one high resolution, most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS, which is actually used to detect extrasolar planets and sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.How we get spectra? I'm sure most of you know from school physics that it's basically splitting a white light into colors. And if you have a liquid hot mass, it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum. A hot gas is producing emission lines only, no continuum. And if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source, you will see certain patterns which we call absorption lines. Which is used actually to identify chemical elements in a cool matter, which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.Now, what we can do with the spectra? We can actually study line-of-sight velocities of cosmic objects. And we can also study chemical composition and physical parameters of stars, galaxies, nebulae. A star is the most simple object. In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on, creating chemical elements. And we have a cool atmosphere. It's cool for me. Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees. My colleagues in infra-red astronomy call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them. But you know, everything is relative. So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool. (Laughter)This is the spectrum of the Sun \u2014 24,000 spectral lines, and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified. It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century, and we still cannot properly understand the spectrum of the sun. Sometimes we have to deal with just one tiny, weak spectral line to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere. For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun. And we use this weak feature to measure the composition of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.And now this is a work in progress. We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature, which belongs to osmium. It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae. It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium. Just comparing the composition of osmium in one of the planet host stars, we want to understand why there is so much of this element. Perhaps we even think that maybe supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars. It can be an indication.The other day, my colleague from Berkeley, Gibor Basri, emailed me a very interesting spectrum, asking me, \"Can you have a look at this?\" And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks, when I saw the huge amount of oxygen and other elements in the spectrum of the stars. I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy. It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system, which polluted the atmosphere of this star. And later a black hole was formed in a binary system, which is still there with a mass of about five solar masses. This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from supernovae explosions.My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements in different galactic stars, actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy. It's amazing that you can go so far simply studying the chemical composition of stars. They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy. There is interaction of galaxies. We know this. And sometimes they just capture stars.You've heard about solar flares. We were very surprised to discover a super flare, a flare which is thousands of millions of times more powerful than those we see in the Sun. In one of the binary stars in our galaxy called FH Leo, we discovered the super flare. And later we went to study the spectral stars to see is there anything strange with these objects. And we found that everything is normal. These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal. So this is a mystery. It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares. And there are six or seven similar cases reported in the literature.Now to go ahead with this, we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe. It's very complicated. I don't really want you to try to understand what is here. (Laughter) But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story of the production of chemical elements. You have two channels \u2014 the massive stars and low-mass stars \u2014 producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe. And doing this for 14 billion years, we end up with this picture, which is a very important graph, showing relative abundances of chemical elements in sun-like stars and in the interstellar medium.So which means that it's really impossible to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon, five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible. And if you find one, I will say that this is something related to SETI, because naturally you can't do it. Doppler Effect is something very important from fundamental physics. And this is related to the change of the frequency of a moving source. The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.The precision which we need to discover a Jupiter-like planet around a sun-like star is something like 28.4 meters per second. And we need nine centimeters per second to detect an Earth-like planet. This can be done with the future spectrographs. I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team which is developing a CODEX, high resolution, future generation spectrograph for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope. And this is going to be an instrument to detect Earth-like planets around sun-like stars. It is an amazing tool called astroseismology where we can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of stars.This is the sound of an Alpha Cen. We can detect sound waves in the atmospheres of sun-like stars. Those waves have frequencies in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain. Coming back to the most important question, \"Is there anybody out there?\" This is closely related to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets. Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity, without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.How to measure, if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small, so those planets are tectonically dead, there cannot be life. If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium, probably, again, there would be no life. Because can you imagine everything boiling? It's too much energy on a planet. Now, we have been measuring abundance of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets. It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.We are actually trying to measure this profile and to detect thorium. It's very tough. It's very tough. And you have to, first you have to convince yourself. Then you have to convince your colleagues. And then you have to convince the whole world that you have actually detected something like this in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here. It's really difficult. But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets, you have to do this job. Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have in those systems.The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals. If you receive something interesting, well that's what SETI does actually, what SETI has been doing for many years. I think the most promising way is to go for biomarkers. You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum, and that is a very clear signal. The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge, is a detection of vegetated area. It's amazing that we can detect vegetation from a spectrum. Now imagine doing this test for other planets.Now very recently, very recently, I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months, water, methane, carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system. It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy. You can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far, far, far from solar system. We have to detect oxygen or ozone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life.Cosmic miracles are something which can be related to SETI. Now imagine an object, amazing object, or something which we cannot explain when we just stand up and say, \"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.\" So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say, \"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow.\"And with the known physics etc, it's something actually which has been pointed out by Frank Drake, many years ago, and Shklovsky. If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star, if you see strange chemical elements, it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it. They want to actually signal their presence through these spectral lines, in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.There can be different ways doing this. One is, for instance, technetium is a radioactive element with a decay time of 4.2 million years. If you suddenly observe technetium in a sun-like star, you can be sure that somebody has put this element in the atmosphere, because in a natural way it is impossible to do this. Now we are reviewing the spectra of about 300 stars with extrasolar planets. And we are doing this job since 2000 and it's a very heavy project. We have been working very hard. And we have some interesting cases, candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain. And I hope in the near future we can confirm this.So the main question: \"Are we alone?\" I think it will not come from UFOs. It will not come from radio signals. I think it will come from a spectrum like this. It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth, showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide, as a clear signal of life, and oxygen and ozone. If, one day, and I think it will be within 15 years from now, or 20 years. If we discover a spectrum like this we can be sure that there is life on that planet. In about five years we will discover planets like Earth, around sun-like stars, the same distance as the Earth from the Sun. It will take about five years. And then we will need another 10, 15 years with space projects to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you. And if we see the nitrogen dioxide and oxygen, I think we have the perfect E.T. Thank you very much.

The only conclusion we could make from this\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nis clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin this system, which polluted the atmosphere\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof this star.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd later a black hole was formed\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nin a binary system,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhich is still there with a mass of about\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nfive solar masses.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis was considered as first evidence that actually black holes\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\ncome from supernovae explosions.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nMy colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nin different galactic stars,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nactually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt's amazing that you can go so far\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nsimply studying the chemical composition of stars.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThey actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nis an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThere is interaction of galaxies. We know this.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd sometimes they just capture stars.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou've heard about solar flares.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nWe were very surprised to discover\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\na super flare,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\na flare which is thousands of millions of times\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmore powerful than those we see in the Sun.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn one of the binary stars in our galaxy\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\ncalled FH Leo,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwe discovered the super flare.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd later we went to study the spectral stars\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nto see is there anything strange with these objects.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd we found that everything is normal.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThese stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo this is a mystery.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd there are six or seven similar cases\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nreported in the literature.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nNow to go ahead with this,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nwe really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIt's very complicated. I don't really want you to\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\ntry to understand what is here.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:07:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut it's to show you how complicated is the whole story\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nof the production of chemical elements.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nYou have two channels --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthe massive stars and low-mass stars --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nproducing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd doing this for 14 billion years,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nwe end up with this picture,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhich is a very important graph,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nshowing relative abundances of chemical elements\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nin sun-like stars\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand in the interstellar medium.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nSo which means that it's really impossible\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nto find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfive times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd if you find one, I will say that\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nthis is something related to SETI,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nbecause naturally you can't do it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nDoppler Effect is something very important\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nfrom fundamental physics.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd this is related to the change of the frequency\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nof a moving source.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nThe precision which we need\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nto discover a Jupiter-like planet\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\naround a sun-like star\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis something like 28.4 meters per second.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd we need nine centimeters per second\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nto detect an Earth-like planet.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nThis can be done with the future spectrographs.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nI, myself, I'm actually involved in the team\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhich is developing a CODEX,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nhigh resolution, future generation spectrograph\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nfor the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd this is going to be an instrument\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nto detect Earth-like planets\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\naround sun-like stars.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIt is an amazing tool called astroseismology\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nwhere we can detect sound waves\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nin the atmospheres of stars.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThis is the sound of an Alpha Cen.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWe can detect sound waves\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin the atmospheres of sun-like stars.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThose waves have frequencies\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nin infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nComing back to the most important question,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\n\"Is there anybody out there?\"\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nThis is closely related\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nto tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nConnection between life\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand radioactive nuclei\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nis straightforward.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nNo life without tectonic activity,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwithout volcanic activity.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd we know very well that geothermal energy\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nis mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nHow to measure, if we have planets\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwhere the amount of those elements is small,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nso those planets are tectonically dead,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthere cannot be life.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nIf there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nprobably, again, there would be no life.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nBecause can you imagine everything boiling?\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nIt's too much energy on a planet.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nNow, we have been measuring abundance\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nof thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nIt's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe are actually trying to measure this profile\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand to detect thorium.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIt's very tough. It's very tough.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd you have to, first you have to convince yourself.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThen you have to convince your colleagues.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd then you have to convince the whole world\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthat you have actually detected something like this\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nin the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nhost star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nIt's really difficult.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nBut if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nyou have to do this job.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBecause you have to know how much of radioactive element you have\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nin those systems.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe one way to discover about aliens\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nis to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nIf you receive something interesting,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwell that's what SETI does actually,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nwhat SETI has been doing for many years.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI think the most promising way\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis to go for biomarkers.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nYou can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand that is a very clear signal.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThe slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nis a detection of vegetated area.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt's amazing that we can detect vegetation\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nfrom a spectrum.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nNow imagine doing this test\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nfor other planets.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nNow very recently, very recently,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwater, methane, carbon dioxide\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nhave been detected in the spectrum\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nof a planet outside the solar system.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIt's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nYou can actually go and detect\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nand study a chemical composition of planets\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfar, far, far from solar system.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nWe have to detect oxygen or ozone\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto make sure that we have all necessary conditions\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nto have life.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nCosmic miracles are something\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhich can be related to SETI.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nNow imagine an object, amazing object,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nor something which we cannot explain\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nwhen we just stand up and say,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n\"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.\"\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nSo it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n\"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow.\"\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd with the known physics etc,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nit's something actually which has been pointed out\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nby Frank Drake,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nmany years ago, and Shklovsky.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIf you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nif you see strange chemical elements,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nit can be a signal from a civilization\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwhich is there and they want to signal about it.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey want to actually signal their presence\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nthrough these spectral lines,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nin the spectrum of a star, in different ways.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThere can be different ways doing this.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nOne is, for instance, technetium\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nis a radioactive element\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwith a decay time of 4.2 million years.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIf you suddenly observe technetium\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin a sun-like star,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nyou can be sure that somebody has put this\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nelement in the atmosphere,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nbecause in a natural way it is impossible to do this.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nNow we are reviewing the spectra of about\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n300 stars with extrasolar planets.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd we are doing this job since 2000\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand it's a very heavy project.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nWe have been working very hard.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we have some interesting cases,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\ncandidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd I hope in the near future\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwe can confirm this.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo the main question: \"Are we alone?\"\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nI think it will not come from UFOs.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIt will not come from radio signals.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nI think it will come from a spectrum like this.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nIt is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nshowing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nas a clear signal of life,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nand oxygen and ozone.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIf, one day, and I think it will be\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwithin 15 years from now, or 20 years.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nIf we discover a spectrum like this\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwe can be sure that there is life on that planet.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIn about five years we will discover\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nplanets like Earth, around sun-like stars,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nthe same distance as the Earth from the Sun.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nIt will take about five years.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd then we will need another 10, 15 years\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwith space projects\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nto get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd if we see the nitrogen dioxide\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand oxygen,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nI think we have the perfect E.T.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The power of time off", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off", "transcript": "I run a design studio in New York. Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year. In that year, we are not available for any of our clients. We are totally closed. And as you can imagine, it is a lovely and very energetic time.I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves, music and design. And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know, and for even more that you've never heard of. As I realized, just like with many many things in my life that I actually love, I adapt to it. And I get, over time, bored by them. And for sure, in our case, our work started to look the same. You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book. Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged in a book, in a die cut. So I decided to close it down for one year.Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning, then there is another 40 years that's really reserved for working. And then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement. And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years. (Applause) That's clearly enjoyable for myself. But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large, rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago, Jonathan Haidt, who defined his work into three different levels. And they rang very true for me. I can see my work as a job. I do it for money. I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays. And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism. In a career I'm definitely more engaged. But at the same time, there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while? While in the third one, in the calling, very much likely I would do it also if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.I am not a religious person myself, but I did look for nature. I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City. Looked for something different for the second one. Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing because I knew them too well. So Asia it was. The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali. Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was. It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.I arrived there in September 2008, and pretty much started to work right away. There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself. However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily. And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house, and attacked me during my morning walks. So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts. Every single dog on one tee shirt. As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message (Laughter) on the back of the shirt. (Laughter)Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio. And then just leave it all to them. And I don't have to do anything. So I looked for furniture. And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked, I couldn't afford. And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like. So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture. This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs. It's not quite finished yet. And I think by the time this lamp came about, (Laughter) I had finally made peace with those dogs. (Laughter)Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table. It's called Be Here Now. It includes 330 compasses. And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside, and make those compasses go crazy, always centering on them. Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair. I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali. And at the same time, I'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses. So I will not really go too far into it.Many of you will know this TEDster, Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually, I got it through the TED book club. I think it took me four years to finally read it, while on sabbatical. And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical. And I'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.This is Ferran Adria. Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli. His restaurant is open seven months every year. He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff. His latest numbers are fairly impressive. He can seat, throughout the year, he can seat 8,000 people. And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical, it's 12.5 percent of my time. And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine, 3M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want. There is some good successes. Scotch tape came out of this program, as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M. Google, of course, very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects.Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical? That's about five percent of everybody. So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up. Talk to them about if it was successful or not. I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future, my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it.When I had the idea of doing one, the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book. And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on. (Laughter)In the beginning, on the first sabbatical, it was rather disastrous. I had thought that I should do this without any plan, that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation. It was not. I just, without a plan, I just reacted to little requests, not work requests, those I all said no to, but other little requests. Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that. So I became my own intern. (Laughter)And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in, put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan, very much like in grade school. What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing; 9 to 10: future thinking. Was not very successful. And so on and so forth. And that actually, specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me. What came out of it? I really got close to design again. I had fun. Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful. Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.And probably most importantly, basically everything we've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year. And I'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical. One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated. This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies, and not for everybody else.We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica, the Rem Koolhaas-built music center in Porto, in Portugal. And even though I desired to do an identity that doesn't use the architecture, I failed at that. And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning. Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English, basically as logo making. And I understood that the building itself was a logo.So then it became quite easy. We put a mask on it, looked at it deep down in the ground, checked it out from all sides, west, north, south, east, top and bottom. Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software, the Casa da Musica Logo Generator. That's connected to a scanner. You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image. And the software, in a second, will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo. Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster, comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same.So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course. If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo. Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers, who all performed there, get their own Casa da Musica logo. It works the same internally with the president or the musical director, whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards. There is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building. It has a more transparent identity. The truck they go on tour with. Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra, 12 people that remixes its own title.And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it. Like this Donna Toney poster, or Chopin, or Mozart, or La Monte Young. You can take the shape and make typography out of it. You can grow it underneath the skin. You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house, or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program, as well as educational services.Second insight. So far, until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes, which was fine with me. On one hand I have nothing against selling. My parents are both salespeople. But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language, why do I only promote with it? There must be something else. And the whole series of work came out of it. Some of you might have seen it. I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before, under the title \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.\" I'll just show two now.This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York. It says, \"Self-confidence produces fine results.\" This is after a week. After two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, five weeks. And you see the self confidence almost comes back, but not quite. These are some pictures visitors sent to me. (Laughter)And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something. We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece. We got 250,000 coins from the central bank, at different darknesses. So we got brand new ones, shiny ones, medium ones, and very old, dark ones. And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week, created this fairly floral typography that spelled, \"Obsessions make my life worse and my work better.\"And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, \"Should I really take as much money as I can? Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?\" While we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it. So when it was finally done, and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry, one of the neighbors called the police.And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom, came, saw, and they wanted to protect the artwork. And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters. (Laughter) I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here. That's the police, getting rid of it all. So after eight hours that's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing. (Laughter)We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali. It's a movie about happiness. And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us. They weren't quite slick enough. So we asked the goose to do it again, and hoped she would do somehow, a more elegant or pretty job. And I think she overdid it. Just a bit too ornamental. And my studio is very close to the monkey forest. And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked, actually, fairly happy. So we asked those guys to do it again. They did a fine job, but had a couple of readability problems. So of course whatever you don't really do yourself doesn't really get done properly.That film we'll be working on for the next two years. So it's going to be a while. And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile. Then you can of course always go and see this guy.Video: (Laughter) And I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

I do it for money.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nI likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIn a career I'm definitely more engaged.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBut at the same time, there will be periods when I think\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nis all that really hard work really worth my while?\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWhile in the third one, in the calling,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nvery much likely I would do it also\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nif I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nI am not a religious person myself,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nbut I did look for nature.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nI had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nLooked for something different for the second one.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nEurope and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nbecause I knew them too well. So Asia it was.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThe most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nwere Sri Lanka and Bali.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nI arrived there in September 2008,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand pretty much started to work right away.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThere is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nHowever the first thing that I needed was\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nmosquito repellent typography\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nbecause they were definitely around heavily.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd then I needed some sort of way\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nto be able to get back to all the wild dogs\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat surround my house,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand attacked me during my morning walks.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nEvery single dog on one tee shirt.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAs a little retaliation\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith a just ever so slightly menacing message\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\non the back of the shirt.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nJust before I left New York\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nI decided I could actually renovate my studio.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd then just leave it all to them.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd I don't have to do anything.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSo I looked for furniture.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd it turned out that\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nall the furniture that I really liked,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI couldn't afford.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo one of the things that we pursued in Bali\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nwas pieces of furniture.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nIt's not quite finished yet.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd I think by the time this lamp came about,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nI had finally made peace with those dogs.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThen there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIt's called Be Here Now.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nIt includes 330 compasses.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd we had custom espresso cups made\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthat hide a magnet inside,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand make those compasses go crazy,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nalways centering on them.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThen this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nI also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nAnd at the same time, I'm extremely aware\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nhow boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nSo I will not really go too far into it.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nMany of you will know this TEDster,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nDanny Gilbert, whose book, actually,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nI got it through the TED book club.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nI think it took me four years\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto finally read it, while on sabbatical.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd I was pleased to see\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthat he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd I'll show you a couple of people\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat did well by pursuing sabbaticals.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThis is Ferran Adria. Many people think\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhe is right now the best chef in the world\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwith his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nHis restaurant is open seven months every year.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nHe closes it down for five months\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nto experiment with a full kitchen staff.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nHis latest numbers are fairly impressive.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHe can seat, throughout the year,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhe can seat 8,000 people.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIf I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nit's 12.5 percent of my time.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n3M since the 1930s\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis giving all their engineers\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n15 percent to pursue whatever they want.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThere is some good successes.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nScotch tape came out of this program,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nas well as Art Fry developed\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nsticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nGoogle, of course, very famously\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\ngives 20 percent for their software engineers\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto pursue their own personal projects.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThat's about five percent of everybody.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nTalk to them about if it was successful or not.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI've found that\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nfinding out about what I'm going to like in the future,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nmy very best way is to talk to people\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwho have actually done it\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nmuch better than myself envisioning it.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWhen I had the idea of doing one,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthe process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nso that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nIn the beginning, on the first sabbatical,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nit was rather disastrous.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI had thought that I should do this without any plan,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat this vacuum of time somehow would\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nbe wonderful and enticing\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfor idea generation. It was not.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nI just, without a plan, I just reacted\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nto little requests, not work requests,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthose I all said no to, but other little requests.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nSending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo I became my own intern.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd I very quickly\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nmade a list of the things I was interested in,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nput them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand then made a plan, very much like in grade school.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWhat does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n9 to 10: future thinking.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nWas not very successful. And so on and so forth.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd that actually, specifically as a starting point\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nof the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nWhat came out of it?\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI really got close to design again.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI had fun.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nFinancially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nBecause of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd probably most importantly,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbasically everything we've done\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nin the seven years following the first sabbatical\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\ncame out of thinking of that one single year.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd I'll show you a couple of projects\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthat came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nOne of the strands of thinking I was involved in was\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat sameness is so incredibly overrated.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThis whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nworks for a very very few strand of companies,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand not for everybody else.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nWe were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthe Rem Koolhaas-built music center\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nin Porto, in Portugal.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd even though I desired to do an identity\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthat doesn't use the architecture,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI failed at that.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd mostly also because I realized\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nout of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nhe talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWhich I understood after I\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\ntranslated it from architecture speech\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin to regular English,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbasically as logo making.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd I understood that the building itself was a logo.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo then it became quite easy.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe put a mask on it,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nlooked at it deep down in the ground,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nchecked it out from all sides,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwest, north, south, east,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\ntop and bottom.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nColored them in a very particular way\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nby having a friend of mine write a piece of software,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe Casa da Musica Logo Generator.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThat's connected to a scanner.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYou put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the software, in a second,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nwill give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nWhich, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\ncomes in handy, because the visual information of the logo\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand the actual poster is exactly the same.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nSo it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIf Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nOr Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nwho all performed there, get their own\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nCasa da Musica logo.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nIt works the same internally with the president or the musical director,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nwhose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThere is a full-blown orchestra\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nliving inside the building.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIt has a more transparent identity.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThe truck they go on tour with.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nOr there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:23.958\n12 people that remixes its own title.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd one of the handy things that came about\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwas that you could take the logo type\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nand create advertising out of it.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nLike this Donna Toney poster,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nor Chopin, or Mozart,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nor La Monte Young.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nYou can take the shape and make typography out of it.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nYou can grow it underneath the skin.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nYou can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nor a rave underneath the house\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nor a weekly program,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nas well as educational services.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSecond insight. So far, until that point I had\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbeen mostly involved\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nor used the language of design\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nfor promotional purposes,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich was fine with me.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nOn one hand I have nothing against selling.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nMy parents are both salespeople.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nBut I did feel that\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nI spent so much time learning this language,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhy do I only promote with it?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThere must be something else.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd the whole series of work came out of it.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSome of you might have seen it.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nI showed some of it\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nat earlier TEDs before,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nunder the title \"Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.\"\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI'll just show two now.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThis is a whole wall of bananas\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nat different ripenesses\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\non the opening day in this gallery in New York.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIt says, \"Self-confidence produces fine results.\"\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThis is after a week.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAfter two weeks,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nthree weeks, four weeks, five weeks.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nAnd you see the self confidence almost comes back,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nbut not quite.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nThese are some pictures visitors sent to me.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd then the city of Amsterdam\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ngave us a plaza and asked us to do something.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nWe used the stone plates as a grid\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nfor our little piece.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nWe got 250,000 coins from the central bank,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nat different darknesses.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nSo we got brand new ones, shiny ones,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nmedium ones, and very old, dark ones.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\ncreated this fairly floral typography\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat spelled, \"Obsessions make my life worse\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand my work better.\"\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd the idea of course was to\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nmake the type so precious\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nthat as an audience\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nyou would be in between,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\n\"Should I really take as much money as I can?\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nOr should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWhile we built all this up\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nduring that week, with the 100 volunteers,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\na good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\ngot very close to it and quite loved it.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo when it was finally done,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nand in the first night\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\na guy came with big plastic bags\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\none of the neighbors called the police.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd the Amsterdam police\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nin all their wisdom,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\ncame, saw,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nand they wanted to protect the artwork.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd they swept it all up and put it into custody\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nat police headquarters.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nI think you see, you see them sweeping.

It's one of the great questions of our time. Yet it's one that's rarely asked. We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were. And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me \u2014 it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil \u2014 in order to feed us. These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either. As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals. And given that it takes three times as much grain \u2014 actually ten times as much grain \u2014 to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.And it's an escalating problem too. By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities. And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed. So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand. And that's going to pose an enormous problem. Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050. That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land. Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion. We're very hungry for fossil fuels too. It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West. And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it. Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away. And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly. A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve. None of it makes very much sense.And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture. As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet. And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.So how did we get here? And more importantly, what are we going to do about it? Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent. Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped. And it was also fertile. And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other. Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements. And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact. They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people. So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them. And in fact, that's true of every ancient city. But of course not all of them were that small. Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. So how did a city like this feed itself? The answer is what I call \"ancient food miles.\"Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away. This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough. And the food obviously went off very quickly. So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves. And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really. (Laughter) In fact \u2014 I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite. But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world. If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map. So the grain markets were to the south of the city. And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago. And the same of course was true for fish. Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing. And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s. Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it. Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move. Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city. So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales. So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there. Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast. I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes. And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it. You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues. Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday. But also you have to imagine it full of food. Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from. In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier. So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle. And then 10 years later everything changed.This is an image of the Great Western in 1840. And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep. So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market. They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside. And they're coming into the city by rail. And this changes everything. To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place. Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means. All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people. And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process. It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape. In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it. And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.Here we have food \u2014 that used to be the center, the social core of the city \u2014 at the periphery. It used to be a social event, buying and selling food. Now it's anonymous. We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something. We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat. We just read the back of a label on a packet. And we don't value food. We don't trust it. So instead of trusting it, we fear it. And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder. By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature. And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.So what are we going to do about that? It's not a new question. 500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself. This is the frontispiece of his book \"Utopia.\" And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on. And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.And here is another very famous \"Utopian\" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, \"The Garden City.\" Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway. And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision. It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had. And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately. It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek. It can either mean a good place, or no place. Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it. And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use. So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, \"sitos\" for food, and \"topos\" for place.I believe we already live in Sitopia. We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool \u2014 a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently. So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like? Well I think it looks a bit like this. I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog. But anyway, this is \u2014 (Laughter) it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it. This is where food should be in our society.But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this. By the way, these can be men as well. It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them. We need these people. We're part of a network. Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this. Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable. But networks, markets where food is being grown locally. It's common. It's fresh. It's part of the social life of the city. Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole. Cows with a view. Steaming piles of humus. This is basically bringing the whole thing together.And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto. It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food. Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know. But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing. It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere. The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing. And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this. We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected. But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore. We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing. It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago. It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"Allegory of Good Government.\" It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside. And I think the message of this is very clear. If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city. And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today? What would an allegory of good government look like today? Because I think it's an urgent question. It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering. We know we are what we eat. We need to realize that the world is also what we eat. But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better. Thank you very much.

And actually if we carry on as we are,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nit's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nto create new arable land.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAlthough at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nof existing arables to salinization and erosion.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWe're very hungry for fossil fuels too.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIt takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nof food that we consume in the West.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe don't actually value it.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nHalf the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd to end all of this, at the end of this long process,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwe're not even managing to feed the planet properly.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nA billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nNone of it makes very much sense.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nis controlled by just five multinational corporations,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nit's a grim picture.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAs we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd if we look to the future,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nit's an unsustainable diet.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nSo how did we get here?\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nAnd more importantly, what are we going to do about it?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nWell, to answer the slightly easier question first,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nabout 10,000 years ago, I would say,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nis the beginning of this process\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nin the ancient Near East,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nknown as the Fertile Crescent.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nBecause, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd it was also fertile.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd it was here, about 10,000 years ago,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat two extraordinary inventions,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nagriculture and urbanism, happened\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nroughly in the same place and at the same time.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThis is no accident,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nBecause it was discovery of grain\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nby our ancient ancestors for the first time\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat produced a food source that was large enough\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand stable enough to support permanent settlements.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd if we look at what those settlements were like,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwe see they were compact.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThey were surrounded by productive farm land\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand dominated by large temple complexes\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nlike this one at Ur,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthat were, in fact, effectively,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nspiritualized, central food distribution centers.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBecause it was the temples that organized the harvest,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\ngathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo, if you like,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nthe whole spiritual and physical life of these cities\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwas dominated by the grain and the harvest\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthat sustained them.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd in fact, that's true of every ancient city.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nBut of course not all of them were that small.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nFamously, Rome had about a million citizens\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nby the first century A.D.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo how did a city like this feed itself?\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nThe answer is what I call \"ancient food miles.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBasically, Rome had access to the sea,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwhich made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbecause it was very difficult to transport food over roads,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nwhich were rough.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd the food obviously went off very quickly.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo Rome effectively waged war\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\non places like Carthage and Egypt\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\njust to get its paws on their grain reserves.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwas really sort of one long, drawn out\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nmilitarized shopping spree, really.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIn fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nRome in fact used to import oysters from London,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nat one stage. I think that's extraordinary.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nSo Rome shaped its hinterland\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthrough its appetite.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nBut the interesting thing is that the other thing also\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nhappened in the pre-industrial world.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIf we look at a map of London in the 17th century,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwe can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nalong the bottom of this map.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nSo the grain markets were to the south of the city.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd the roads leading up from them\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto Cheapside, which was the main market,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwere also grain markets.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd if you look at the name of one of those streets,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBread Street, you can tell\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwhat was going on there 300 years ago.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd the same of course was true for fish.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nFish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\noperating on-site here until the mid-1980s.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhich is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nEverybody else was wandering around\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwith mobile phones that looked like bricks\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nand sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThis is another thing about food in cities:\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nOnce its roots into the city are established,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthey very rarely move.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nMeat is a very different story\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nbecause, of course, animals could walk into the city.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo much of London's meat\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwas coming from the northwest,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nfrom Scotland and Wales.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nSo it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwhich is why Smithfield,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nLondon's very famous meat market, was located up there.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nPoultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nI feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand so the birds were coming in\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwith their feet protected with little canvas shoes.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd then when they hit the eastern end\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nof Cheapside, that's where they were sold,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhich is why it's called Poultry.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd, in fact, if you look at the map of any city\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nbuilt before the industrial age,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nyou can trace food coming in to it.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nYou can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nboth by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nFriday Street, in a previous life,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nis where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nBut also you have to imagine it full of food.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBecause the streets and the public spaces\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nwere the only places where food was bought and sold.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nyou can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand be unaware of where your food came from.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nIn fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthe chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nabout three days earlier.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nSo this was obviously an organic city,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\npart of an organic cycle.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd then 10 years later everything changed.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nThis is an image of the Great Western in 1840.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwere pigs and sheep.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nThey're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsomewhere in the countryside.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nAnd they're coming into the city by rail.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd this changes everything.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nTo start off with, it makes it possible\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nfor the first time to grow cities,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nreally any size and shape, in any place.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nCities used to be constrained by geography;\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthey used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAll of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd as you can see from these maps of London,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin the 90 years after the trains came,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nit goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nby animals coming in on foot, and so on,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nto a large splurge,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthat would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\neither animals or people.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand really this marks the end of this process.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's the final emancipation of the city\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nfrom any apparent relationship with nature at all.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\ndevoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nbecause nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIn fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ndrove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\ncame back with a week's worth of shopping,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand wondered what on earth to do with it.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd this really is the moment when our relationship,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nboth with food and cities, changes completely.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHere we have food -- that used to be the center,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe social core of the city -- at the periphery.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nIt used to be a social event, buying and selling food.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNow it's anonymous.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWe used to cook; now we just add water,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nor a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nWe don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe just read the back of a label on a packet.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd we don't value food. We don't trust it.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo instead of trusting it, we fear it.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd instead of valuing it, we throw it away.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nOne of the great ironies of modern food systems\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nis that they've made the very thing they promised\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nto make easier much harder.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nBy making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthey've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhich is that of us and nature.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nthat, as we've seen, are unsustainable.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo what are we going to do about that?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nIt's not a new question.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nThis is the frontispiece of his book \"Utopia.\"\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd it was a series of semi-independent city-states,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nif that sounds remotely familiar,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\na day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand grew vegetables in their back gardens,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand ate communal meals together, and so on.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd I think you could argue that\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfood is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\neven though More never framed it that way.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd here is another very famous \"Utopian\" vision,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthat of Ebenezer Howard, \"The Garden City.\"\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nSame idea: series of semi-independent city-states,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nlittle blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\njoined to one another by railway.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd again, food could be said to be\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthe ordering principle of his vision.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nIt even got built, but nothing to do with\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nthis vision that Howard had.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nthat they are Utopian.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nUtopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nIt was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt can either mean a good place, or no place.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBecause it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd I think, as a conceptual tool\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nfor thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat makes it not much use.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo I've come up with an alternative,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwhich is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\n\"sitos\" for food, and \"topos\" for place.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI believe we already live in Sitopia.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWe live in a world shaped by food,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\na conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nSo if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWell I think it looks a bit like this.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nI have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nBut anyway, this is -- (Laughter)\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nit's food at the center of life,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nat the center of family life, being celebrated,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbeing enjoyed, people taking time for it.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThis is where food should be in our society.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nBut you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nBy the way, these can be men as well.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nIt's people who think about food,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwho think ahead, who plan,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwho can stare at a pile of raw vegetables\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand actually recognize them.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nWe need these people. We're part of a network.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nHere, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nBut networks, markets where food is being grown locally.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's common. It's fresh.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIt's part of the social life of the city.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBecause without that, you can't have this kind of place,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nfood that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand is not just a zero-sum commodity\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\noff in some unseen hell-hole.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nCows with a view.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSteaming piles of humus.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThis is basically bringing the whole thing together.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd this is a community project\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI visited recently in Toronto.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt's a greenhouse, where kids get told\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nall about food and growing their own food.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nHere is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nplant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nBut anyway, these kinds of projects\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nthat are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nSo Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nIt's basically recognizing that Sitopia\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nalready exists in little pockets everywhere.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThe trick is to join them up,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nto use food as a way of seeing.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nas big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nWe're going to see them more like this,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nas part of the productive, organic framework\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nof which they are inevitably a part,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nsymbiotically connected.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nBut of course, that's not a great image either,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nbecause we need not to be producing food like this anymore.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nWe need to be thinking more about permaculture,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwhich is why I think this image just\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nsums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIt's a re-conceptualization\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof the way food shapes our lives.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThe best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIt's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"Allegory of Good Government.\"\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIt's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nAnd I think the message of this is very clear.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nIf the city looks after the country,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nthe country will look after the city.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd I want us to ask now,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nwhat would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nif he painted this image today?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWhat would an allegory of good government look like today?\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBecause I think it's an urgent question.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nIt's one we have to ask,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand we have to start answering.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWe know we are what we eat.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nWe need to realize that the world is also what we eat.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nBut if we take that idea, we can use food\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nas a really powerful tool to shape the world better.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Tribal leadership", "duration": "999", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_logan_on_tribal_leadership", "transcript": "What we're really here to talk about is the \"how.\" Okay, so how exactly do we create this world-shattering, if you will, innovation? Now, I want to tell you a quick story. We'll go back a little more than a year. In fact, the date \u2014 I'm curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date? It was February 3rd, 2008. Anyone remember what happened, February 3rd, 2008? Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties, is that it seemed to us that across the United States, if you will, tribal councils had convened. And they had discussed things of great national importance. Like, \"Do we like the Budweiser commercial?\" and, \"Do we like the nachos?\" and, \"Who is going to win?\" But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.And if you go back in time to February 3rd, it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination. And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way. But when we talked to people, it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States. Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of about 20 \u2014 so kind of more than a team \u2014 20 to about 150 people. And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done. But not just work. It's within these tribes that societies get built, that important things happen.And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives from various tribal councils that met, also known as Super Bowl parties, we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day. February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday. We said, \"The tribes that we're in are saying it's going to be Obama.\" Now, the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.All of you are members of tribes. In walking around at the break, many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them. And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do, which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe, and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe, and make introductions. That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.So here is the bottom line. If you focus in on a group like this \u2014 this happens to be a USC game \u2014 and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people, you would in fact see not a single crowd, just like there is not a single crowd here, but you would see these tribes that are then coming together. And from a distance it appears that it's a single group. And so people form tribes. They always have. They always will. Just as fish swim and birds fly, people form tribes. It's just what we do. But here's the rub. Not all tribes are the same, and what makes the difference is the culture.Now here is the net out of this. You're all a member of tribes. If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in and nudge them forward, along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain. But we're going to start with what we call Stage One. Now, this is the lowest of the stages. You don't want this. Okay? This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen. But it's one that I think we need to learn from.Stage One produces people who do horrible things. This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech. Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes, and then pool together with people who think like they do. Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons. Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One. And I want to make the point that as members of society, we need to. It's not enough to simply write people off.But let's move on to Stage Two. Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, \"Life Sucks.\" So, this other book that Steve mentioned, that just came out, called \"The Three Laws of Performance,\" my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I, argue that as people see the world, so they behave. Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks, then their behavior will follow automatically from that. It will be despairing hostility. They'll do whatever it takes to survive, even if that means undermining other people.Now, my birthday is coming up shortly, and my driver's license expires. And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe, which looks like this. (Laughter) Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land, you find a Stage Two culture? No. But in the one near me, where I have to go in just a few days, what I will say when I'm standing in line is, \"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?\" (Laughter)Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here? Actually, no, I'm not. But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb. So in a Stage Two culture \u2014 and we find these in all sorts of different places \u2014 you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world. You find them in all places in society. I've come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class. But here is the point. If you believe and you say to people in your tribe, in effect, \"My life sucks. I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\" If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done. What kind of innovation would get done? The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen? In fact it would be basically nil.Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us. Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move. And we park. And we stay. Stage Three says, \"I'm great. And you're not.\" (Laughter) I'm great and you're not. Now imagine having a whole room of people saying, in effect, \"I'm great and you're not.\" Or, \"I'm going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that.\" A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar. But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator. I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book. And one doctor said to the others, \"Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine?\" And the other said, \"No. That's great. Congratulations!\"The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said, \"Well while you were, you know, doing your research,\" \u2014 notice the condescending tone \u2014 \"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.\"And the third one got the same wry smile and said, \"Well, while you were off doing your research, and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery, that eventually we'll train monkeys to do, or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all, I was off running the future of the residency program, which is really the future of medicine.\"And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back. And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out. That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe. Now, we find these in places where really smart, successful people show up. Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC. (Laughter)Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation. It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four. Let's take a look at a quick video snippet. This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas. And my question on the other side is just going to be, \"What do you think they value?\" It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree. This is their lobby. Employees volunteer time in the advice booth. Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos. This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated. Notice people are applauding for us. They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did they probably wouldn't applaud. But you'll notice the level of excitement. Notice, again, how they decorate their office. Now, what's important to people at Zappos, these may not be the things that are important to you. But they value things like fun. And they value creativity. One of their stated values is, \"Be a little bit weird.\" And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that's greater than their individual competence, then something very important happens. The group gels. And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger, into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence. Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things. But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet. There is, in fact, another stage.Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here. And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is \"Life is Great,\" this may seem a little incongruous. This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize. Now think about that. South Africa, terrible atrocities had happened in the society. And people came together focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation. There was no road map. No one had ever done anything like this before.And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance was people's values and their noble cause, what this group accomplished was historic. And people, at the time, feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone, descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end. In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road. Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together. So, people hear this and they conclude the following, as did we in doing the study.Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One. That's like, you know, \"Life sucks.\" Who wants to talk that way? I don't want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives. I really don't want to just say \"I'm great,\" because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends. Saying, \"We're great\" \u2014 that sounds pretty good. But I should really talk Stage Five, right? \"Life is great.\"Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this. The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it, the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights. I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great, oriented only by our values, no other guidance. In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two. \"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant, also known as King George. We're great! Who is not great? England!\" Sorry. (Laughter)Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi? What about Martin Luther King? I mean, surely these were just people who preached, \"Life is great,\" right? Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another. In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three. He didn't say \"We have a dream.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\" Why did he do that? Because most people are not at Stage Five.Two percent are at Stage One. About 25 percent are at Stage Two, saying, in effect, \"My life sucks.\" 48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes, say, \"I'm great and you're not.\" And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics. Only about 22 percent of tribes are at Stage Four, oriented by our values, saying \"We're great. And our values are beginning to unite us.\" Only two percent, only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five. And those are the ones that change the world.So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society. But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay? Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are. So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels, to go to where they are. And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level. I'd like to show you some examples of this.One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan, former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco. And he grew up essentially in Stage One. And you know what changed his life? It was walking into one of these, a Boys and Girls Club. Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco. He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One \u2014 remember, \"Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive\" \u2014 to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, \"Wow. My life really sucks. I don't know anybody. I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does. So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.\"In fact, that's progress. We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then, over time, getting them connected. So, what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four? I want to argue that we're doing that right here. TED represents a set of values, and as we unite around these values, something really interesting begins to emerge.If you want this experience to live on as something historic, then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking. Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach, extend your influence, but instead, find someone you don't know, and find someone else you don't know, and introduce them. That's called a triadic relationship.See, people who build world-changing tribes do that. They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves. And ultimately that adds to their values.But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five? The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization. You know they do polls, right? So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great? Pretty much everybody else who does polls. If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll, people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that. So, they were bored. They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.\"How could we, instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks, or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that, what does the entire world think?\" And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll. They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics, who reported being bored. And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out, \"How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa? How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology, and speak languages we don't speak, and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order to achieve on this great mission, we have to be able to do it. Incidentally, they did pull it off. And they released the first-ever world poll.So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts. First of all: we all form tribes, all of us. You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach of the tribes that you have. But the question on the table is this: What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making? You're hearing one presentation after another, often representing a group of people, a tribe, about how they have changed the world. If you do what we've talked about, you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in. And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward. You remember to talk all five culture stages. Because we've got people in all five, around us. And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this: Will your tribes change the world? Thank you very much.

It's within these tribes\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nthat societies get built,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat important things happen.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nfrom various tribal councils that met,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nalso known as Super Bowl parties,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwe sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nFebruary 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nWe said, \"The tribes that we're in\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nare saying it's going to be Obama.\"\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nNow, the reason we knew that\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwas because we spent the previous 10 years\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nstudying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAll of you are members of tribes.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIn walking around at the break,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nmany of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhich is to find someone\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho is a member of a tribe,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand make introductions.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThat is in fact what great tribal leaders do.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nSo here is the bottom line.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nIf you focus in on a group like this --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthis happens to be a USC game --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand do magnification factors so you could see individual people,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nyou would in fact see not a single crowd,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\njust like there is not a single crowd here,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut you would see these tribes that are then coming together.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nAnd from a distance it appears that it's a single group.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd so people form tribes.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThey always have. They always will.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nJust as fish swim and birds fly,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\npeople form tribes. It's just what we do.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nBut here's the rub.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nNot all tribes are the same,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand what makes the difference is the culture.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nNow here is the net out of this.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nYou're all a member of tribes.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nIf you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand nudge them forward,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nalong these tribal stages\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut we're going to start with what we call Stage One.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nNow, this is the lowest of the stages.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou don't want this. Okay?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nBut it's one that I think we need to learn from.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nStage One produces people\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwho do horrible things.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThis is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nStage One is a group where people\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nsystematically sever relationships from functional tribes,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand then pool together\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwith people who think like they do.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nStage One is literally the culture of gangs\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand it is the culture of prisons.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nNow, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd I want to make the point\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nthat as members of society, we need to.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nIt's not enough to simply write people off.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nBut let's move on to Stage Two.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, \"Life Sucks.\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, this other book that Steve mentioned,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nthat just came out, called \"The Three Laws of Performance,\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nmy colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nargue that as people see the world, so they behave.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nWell, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthen their behavior will follow automatically from that.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nIt will be despairing hostility.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nThey'll do whatever it takes to survive,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\neven if that means undermining other people.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nNow, my birthday is coming up shortly,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand my driver's license expires.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd the reason that that's relevant is that very soon\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI will be walking into what we call\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\na Stage Two tribe,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwhich looks like this.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNow, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nacross the land, you find a Stage Two culture?\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNo. But in the one near me,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwhere I have to go in just a few days,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhat I will say when I'm standing in line is,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n\"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nNow, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nActually, no, I'm not.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nBut I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo in a Stage Two culture --\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand we find these in all sorts of different places --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nyou find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nYou find them in all places in society.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nI've come across them at the organizations\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthat everybody raves about as being best in class.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBut here is the point. If you believe and you say\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nto people in your tribe, in effect,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n\"My life sucks.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nI mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nmy life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nIf that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nWhat kind of innovation would get done?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThe amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIn fact it would be basically nil.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nNow when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nthat hits closest to home for many of us.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nBecause it is in Stage Three that many of us move.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd we park. And we stay.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nStage Three says, \"I'm great. And you're not.\"\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nI'm great and you're not.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nNow imagine having a whole room of people\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nsaying, in effect, \"I'm great and you're not.\"\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nOr, \"I'm going to find some way to compete with you\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand come out on top as a result of that.\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nA whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nBut, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nI happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd one doctor said to the others, \"Did you see my article\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nin the New England Journal of Medicine?\"\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd the other said, \"No. That's great. Congratulations!\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThe next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n\"Well while you were, you know, doing your research,\" --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nnotice the condescending tone --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\n\"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthan anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution.\"\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd the third one got the same wry smile and said,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n\"Well, while you were off doing your research,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat eventually we'll train monkeys to do,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nor cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nI was off running the future of the residency program,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nwhich is really the future of medicine.\"\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nAnd they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThat is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow, we find these in places\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhere really smart, successful people show up.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nLike, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nHere is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt is moving from Stage Three\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nto Stage Four.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nLet's take a look at a quick video snippet.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThis is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd my question on the other side is just going to be,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\n\"What do you think they value?\"\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nThis is their lobby.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nEmployees volunteer time in the advice booth.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nNotice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nOkay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nThis is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nNotice people are applauding for us.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThey don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthey probably wouldn't applaud.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut you'll notice the level of excitement.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nNotice, again, how they decorate their office.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow, what's important to people at Zappos,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthese may not be the things that are important to you.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nBut they value things like fun. And they value creativity.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nOne of their stated values is, \"Be a little bit weird.\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd you'll notice they are a little bit weird.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nSo when individuals come together\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nand find something that unites them\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat's greater than their individual competence,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthen something very important happens.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThe group gels. And it changes\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfrom a group of highly motivated\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nbut fairly individually-centric people\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\ninto something larger,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ninto a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nStage Four tribes can do remarkable things.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBut you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThere is, in fact, another stage.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nNow, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nAnd if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is \"Life is Great,\"\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthis may seem a little incongruous.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThis is a scene or snippet\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nfrom the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nfor which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nNow think about that. South Africa,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nterrible atrocities had happened in the society.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd people came together\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nfocused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThere was no road map. No one had ever done\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nanything like this before.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd in this atmosphere, where the only guidance\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwas people's values and their noble cause,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwhat this group accomplished was historic.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd people, at the time, feared that South Africa\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nwould end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\ndescending into one skirmish after another\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nin a civil war that seems to have no end.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIn fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nLargely because people like Desmond Tutu\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nset up a Stage Five process\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto involve the thousands and perhaps millions\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nof tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nSo, people hear this and they conclude the following,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nas did we in doing the study.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nOkay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThat's like, you know, \"Life sucks.\" Who wants to talk that way?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI don't want to talk like they do\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nat the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI really don't want to just say \"I'm great,\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nbecause that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSaying, \"We're great\" -- that sounds pretty good.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nBut I should really talk Stage Five, right? \"Life is great.\"\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWell, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nthat come out of all this.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nThe first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand actually read it,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe phrase that sticks in many of our minds\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis things about inalienable rights.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\noriented only by our values,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nno other guidance.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIn fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n\"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nalso known as King George.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nWe're great! Who is not great? England!\"\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSorry. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nWell, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat about Martin Luther King?\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI mean, surely these were just people who preached, \"Life is great,\" right?\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nJust one little bit of happiness and joy after another.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIn fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHe didn't say \"We have a dream.\" He said, \"I have a dream.\"\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nWhy did he do that? Because most people\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nare not at Stage Five.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nTwo percent are at Stage One.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAbout 25 percent are at Stage Two,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nsaying, in effect, \"My life sucks.\"\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\n48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nsay, \"I'm great and you're not.\"\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nOnly about 22 percent of tribes\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nare at Stage Four,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\noriented by our values, saying \"We're great.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd our values are beginning to unite us.\"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nOnly two percent, only two percent of tribes\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nget to Stage Five.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd those are the ones that change the world.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo the first little finding from this\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nis that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nso that you can touch every person in society.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nBut you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nTribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nSo we have to have the ability to talk\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nall the levels, to go to where they are.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd then leaders nudge people\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwithin their tribes to the next level.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nI'd like to show you some examples of this.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nOne of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nformer Mayor of San Francisco. Before that\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nhe was Chief of Police in San Francisco.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nAnd he grew up essentially in Stage One.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd you know what changed his life? It was walking into\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\none of these, a Boys and Girls Club.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nNow here is what happened to this person\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwho eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nHe went from being alive and passionate\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nat Stage One -- remember, \"Life sucks,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\ndespairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive\" --\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto walking into a Boys and Girls Club,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nfolding his arms, sitting down in a chair,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand saying, \"Wow. My life really sucks.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nI don't know anybody.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nI mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthen my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything.\"\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nIn fact, that's progress.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nWe move people from Stage One to Stage Two\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nby getting them in a new tribe\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand then, over time, getting them connected.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nSo, what about moving\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nfrom Stage Three to Stage Four?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nI want to argue that we're doing that right here.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nTED represents a set of values,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand as we unite around these values,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nsomething really interesting begins to emerge.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIf you want this experience to live on\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nas something historic,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthen at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nbeyond what people normally do\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand call networking.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nWhich is not just to meet new people\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nand extend your reach, extend your influence,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nbut instead, find someone you don't know,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand find someone else you don't know,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nand introduce them.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThat's called a triadic relationship.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nSee, people who build world-changing tribes do that.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThey extend the reach of their tribes\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nby connecting them, not just to myself,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nso that my following is greater,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nbut I connect people who don't know each other\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nto something greater than themselves.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd ultimately that adds to their values.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBut we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich is great, to Stage Five?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nThe story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\na place called the Gallup Organization.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nYou know they do polls, right?\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSo it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nPretty much everybody else who does polls.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIf Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\npeople will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo, they were bored.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThey wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\n\"How could we,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ninstead of just polling what Asia thinks\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nor what the United States thinks,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nor who thinks what about Obama\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nversus McCain or something like that,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nwhat does the entire world think?\"\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThey had people involved who were Nobel laureates\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nin economics, who reported being bored.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand were trying to figure out, \"How do we survey the population\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nof Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nHow do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand speak languages we don't speak,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nand we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto achieve on this great mission,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nwe have to be able to do it.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nIncidentally, they did pull it off.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd they released the first-ever world poll.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nSo I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nFirst of all: we all form tribes, all of us.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nYou're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nof the tribes that you have.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nBut the question on the table is this:\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nWhat kind of an impact are the tribes\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat you are in making?\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nYou're hearing one presentation after another,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\noften representing a group of people, a tribe,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nabout how they have changed the world.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nIf you do what we've talked about, you listen\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nfor how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nYou remember to talk all five culture stages.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nBecause we've got people in all five, around us.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nAnd the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nWill your tribes change the world?\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The danger of a single story", "duration": "1129", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story", "transcript": "I'm a storyteller. And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call \"the danger of the single story.\" I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria. My mother says that I started reading at the age of two, although I think four is probably close to the truth. So I was an early reader, and what I read were British and American children's books.I was also an early writer, and when I began to write, at about the age of seven, stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read, I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading: All my characters were white and blue-eyed, they played in the snow, they ate apples,(Laughter)and they talked a lot about the weather, how lovely it was that the sun had come out.(Laughter)Now, this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria. I had never been outside Nigeria. We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes, and we never talked about the weather, because there was no need to.My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer, because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer. Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.(Laughter)And for many years afterwards, I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer. But that is another story.What this demonstrates, I think, is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story, particularly as children. Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign, I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify. Now, things changed when I discovered African books. There weren't many of them available, and they weren't quite as easy to find as the foreign books.But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye, I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I started to write about things I recognized.Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature. So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this: It saved me from having a single story of what books are.I come from a conventional, middle-class Nigerian family. My father was a professor. My mother was an administrator. And so we had, as was the norm, live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages. So, the year I turned eight, we got a new house boy. His name was Fide. The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor. My mother sent yams and rice, and our old clothes, to his family. And when I didn't finish my dinner, my mother would say, \"Finish your food! Don't you know? People like Fide's family have nothing.\" So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.Then one Saturday, we went to his village to visit, and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made. I was startled. It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them.Years later, I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States. I was 19. My American roommate was shocked by me. She asked where I had learned to speak English so well, and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language. She asked if she could listen to what she called my \"tribal music,\" and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.(Laughter)She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove.What struck me was this: She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me. Her default position toward me, as an African, was a kind of patronizing, well-meaning pity. My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals.I must say that before I went to the U.S., I didn't consciously identify as African. But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me. Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia. But I did come to embrace this new identity, and in many ways I think of myself now as African. Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country, the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago, in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in \"India, Africa and other countries.\"(Laughter)So, after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African, I began to understand my roommate's response to me. If I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner. I would see Africans in the same way that I, as a child, had seen Fide's family.This single story of Africa ultimately comes, I think, from Western literature. Now, here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Lok, who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage. After referring to the black Africans as \"beasts who have no houses,\" he writes, \"They are also people without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breasts.\"Now, I've laughed every time I've read this. And one must admire the imagination of John Lok. But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are \"half devil, half child.\"And so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not \"authentically African.\" Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity. In fact, I did not know what African authenticity was. The professor told me that my characters were too much like him, an educated and middle-class man. My characters drove cars. They were not starving. Therefore they were not authentically African.But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story. A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S. The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense, and there were debates going on about immigration. And, as often happens in America, immigration became synonymous with Mexicans. There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system, sneaking across the border, being arrested at the border, that sort of thing.I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara, watching the people going to work, rolling up tortillas in the marketplace, smoking, laughing. I remember first feeling slight surprise. And then, I was overwhelmed with shame. I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind, the abject immigrant. I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power. There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is \"nkali.\" It's a noun that loosely translates to \"to be greater than another.\" Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person. The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people, the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with, \"secondly.\" Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state, and you have an entirely different story.I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel. I told him that I had just read a novel called \"American Psycho\" \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers.(Laughter)(Applause)Now, obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation.(Laughter)But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans. This is not because I am a better person than that student, but because of America's cultural and economic power, I had many stories of America. I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill. I did not have a single story of America.When I learned, some years ago, that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful, I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me.(Laughter)But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood, full of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps. My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare. One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water. I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries. And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed. And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.All of these stories make me who I am. But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me. The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.Of course, Africa is a continent full of catastrophes: There are immense ones, such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones, such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria. But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person. The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.So what if before my Mexican trip, I had followed the immigration debate from both sides, the U.S. and the Mexican? What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor and hardworking? What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world? What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls \"a balance of stories.\"What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher, Muhtar Bakare, a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house? Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature. He disagreed. He felt that people who could read, would read, if you made literature affordable and available to them.Shortly after he published my first novel, I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview, and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said, \"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending. Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ...\"(Laughter)And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel. I was not only charmed, I was very moved. Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers. She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.Now, what if my roommate knew about my friend Funmi Iyanda, a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos, and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget? What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week? What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music, talented people singing in English and Pidgin, and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo, mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband's consent before renewing their passports? What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce? What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions? Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition?Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it. I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer, and it is amazing to me how many people apply, how many people are eager to write, to tell stories.My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust, and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don't have anything in their libraries, and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops, in reading and writing, for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North. She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind. \"They sat around, reading the book themselves, listening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained.\"I would like to end with this thought: That when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place, we regain a kind of paradise.Thank you.(Applause)", "id":

disappointed\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.934\nwhen I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.651\nShe assumed that I did not know\nhow to use a stove.\n\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.996\nWhat struck me was this:\n\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.095\nShe had felt sorry for me\neven before she saw me.\n\n00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:57.934\nHer default position\ntoward me, as an African,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.994\nwas a kind of patronizing,\nwell-meaning pity.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.454\nMy roommate had a single story of Africa:\n\n00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:07.935\na single story of catastrophe.\n\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.656\nIn this single story,\n\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.934\nthere was no possibility of Africans\nbeing similar to her in any way,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.934\nno possibility of feelings\nmore complex than pity,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.934\nno possibility of a connection\nas human equals.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.081\nI must say that before I went to the U.S.,\n\n00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.386\nI didn't consciously identify as African.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.934\nBut in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,\npeople turned to me.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.704\nNever mind that I knew nothing\nabout places like Namibia.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.054\nBut I did come to embrace\nthis new identity,\n\n00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:37.934\nand in many ways I think\nof myself now as African.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.934\nAlthough I still get quite irritable\nwhen Africa is referred to as a country,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.934\nthe most recent example being\nmy otherwise wonderful flight\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.243\nfrom Lagos two days ago,\n\n00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.149\nin which there was an announcement\non the Virgin flight\n\n00:05:50.173 --> 00:05:54.934\nabout the charity work in \"India,\nAfrica and other countries.\"\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.275\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:56.434 --> 00:05:59.934\nSo, after I had spent some years\nin the U.S. as an African,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.132\nI began to understand\nmy roommate's response to me.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.983\nIf I had not grown up in Nigeria,\n\n00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:09.148\nand if all I knew about Africa\nwere from popular images,\n\n00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:14.344\nI too would think that Africa\nwas a place of beautiful landscapes,\n\n00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:15.934\nbeautiful animals,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.934\nand incomprehensible people,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.589\nfighting senseless wars,\ndying of poverty and AIDS,\n\n00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.934\nunable to speak for themselves\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:28.113\nand waiting to be saved\nby a kind, white foreigner.\n\n00:06:28.886 --> 00:06:31.055\nI would see Africans\nin the same way that I,\n\n00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:33.782\nas a child, had seen Fide's family.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.934\nThis single story of Africa ultimately\ncomes, I think, from Western literature.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:43.934\nNow, here is a quote from the writing\nof a London merchant called John Lok,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.934\nwho sailed to west Africa in 1561\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.621\nand kept a fascinating\naccount of his voyage.\n\n00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.934\nAfter referring to the black Africans\nas \"beasts who have no houses,\"\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.934\nhe writes, \"They are also\npeople without heads,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.926\nhaving their mouth and eyes\nin their breasts.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.054\nNow, I've laughed\nevery time I've read this.\n\n00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:10.458\nAnd one must admire\nthe imagination of John Lok.\n\n00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.197\nBut what is important about his writing\n\n00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.934\nis that it represents the beginning\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.934\nof a tradition of telling\nAfrican stories in the West:\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.325\nA tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa\nas a place of negatives,\n\n00:07:21.437 --> 00:07:23.592\nof difference, of darkness,\n\n00:07:23.616 --> 00:07:28.934\nof people who, in the words\nof the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.899\nare \"half devil, half child.\"\n\n00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:34.934\nAnd so, I began to realize\nthat my American roommate\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.934\nmust have throughout her life\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.934\nseen and heard different versions\nof this single story,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.934\nas had a professor,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.724\nwho once told me that my novel\nwas not \"authentically African.\"\n\n00:07:47.827 --> 00:07:49.518\nNow, I was quite willing to contend\n\n00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:52.637\nthat there were a number of things\nwrong with the novel,\n\n00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:55.934\nthat it had failed in a number of places,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.197\nbut I had not quite imagined\nthat it had failed\n\n00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.934\nat achieving something\ncalled African authenticity.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.664\nIn fact, I did not know\nwhat African authenticity was.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.354\nThe professor told me that my characters\nwere too much like him,\n\n00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:12.354\nan educated and middle-class man.\n\n00:08:12.378 --> 00:08:14.480\nMy characters drove cars.\n\n00:08:14.504 --> 00:08:16.934\nThey were not starving.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.885\nTherefore they were not\nauthentically African.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.934\nBut I must quickly add\nthat I too am just as guilty\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.028\nin the question of the single story.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.949\nA few years ago,\nI visited Mexico from the U.S.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.625\nThe political climate in the U.S.\nat the time was tense,\n\n00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:36.934\nand there were debates going on\nabout immigration.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.934\nAnd, as often happens in America,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.934\nimmigration became\nsynonymous with Mexicans.\n\n00:08:42.656 --> 00:08:44.589\nThere were endless stories of Mexicans\n\n00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:47.934\nas people who were\nfleecing the healthcare system,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.934\nsneaking across the border,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.423\nbeing arrested at the border,\nthat sort of thing.\n\n00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.934\nI remember walking around\non my first day in Guadalajara,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.934\nwatching the people going to work,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.934\nrolling up tortillas in the marketplace,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.931\nsmoking, laughing.\n\n00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:07.934\nI remember first feeling slight surprise.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.934\nAnd then, I was overwhelmed with shame.\n\n00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:15.934\nI realized that I had been so immersed\nin the media coverage of Mexicans\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthat they had become one thing in my mind,\n\n00:09:17.982 --> 00:09:19.807\nthe abject immigrant.\n\n00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.149\nI had bought into\nthe single story of Mexicans\n\n00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:25.680\nand I could not have\nbeen more ashamed of myself.\n\n00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:28.576\nSo that is how to create a single story,\n\n00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.934\nshow a people as one thing,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.934\nas only one thing,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.934\nover and over again,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.473\nand that is what they become.\n\n00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:40.197\nIt is impossible to talk\nabout the single story\n\n00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:41.910\nwithout talking about power.\n\n00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:45.202\nThere is a word, an Igbo word,\n\n00:09:45.226 --> 00:09:48.877\nthat I think about whenever I think about\nthe power structures of the world,\n\n00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:50.091\nand it is \"nkali.\"\n\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.934\nIt's a noun that loosely translates\nto \"to be greater than another.\"\n\n00:09:55.512 --> 00:09:58.440\nLike our economic and political worlds,\n\n00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:02.934\nstories too are defined\nby the principle of nkali:\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.934\nHow they are told, who tells them,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.195\nwhen they're told,\nhow many stories are told,\n\n00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:10.426\nare really dependent on power.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.101\nPower is the ability not just to tell\nthe story of another person,\n\n00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.934\nbut to make it the definitive\nstory of that person.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.054\nThe Palestinian poet\nMourid Barghouti writes\n\n00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:23.934\nthat if you want to dispossess a people,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.934\nthe simplest way to do it\nis to tell their story\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.188\nand to start with, \"secondly.\"\n\n00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:34.340\nStart the story with the arrows\nof the Native Americans,\n\n00:10:34.364 --> 00:10:36.934\nand not with the arrival of the British,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.935\nand you have an entirely different story.\n\n00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:44.391\nStart the story with\nthe failure of the African state,\n\n00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:47.934\nand not with the colonial\ncreation of the African state,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.700\nand you have an entirely different story.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.934\nI recently spoke at a university\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.743\nwhere a student told me\nthat it was such a shame\n\n00:10:57.767 --> 00:11:00.886\nthat Nigerian men were physical abusers\n\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.854\nlike the father character in my novel.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.934\nI told him that I had just read a novel\ncalled \"American Psycho\" --\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.934\n-- and that it was such a shame\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.934\nthat young Americans\nwere serial murderers.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:24.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.934\nNow, obviously I said this\nin a fit of mild irritation.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.149\nBut it would never have\noccurred to me to think\n\n00:11:32.173 --> 00:11:35.934\nthat just because I had read a novel\nin which a character was a serial killer\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.934\nthat he was somehow\nrepresentative of all Americans.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.934\nThis is not because I am\na better person than that student,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.934\nbut because of America's cultural\nand economic power,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.934\nI had many stories of America.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.934\nI had read Tyler and Updike\nand Steinbeck and Gaitskill.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.518\nI did not have a single story of America.\n\n00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:57.335\nWhen I learned, some years ago,\n\n00:11:57.359 --> 00:12:01.700\nthat writers were expected\nto have had really unhappy childhoods\n\n00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:03.934\nto be successful,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nI began to think about how I could invent\nhorrible things my parents had done to me.\n\n00:12:07.982 --> 00:12:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.934\nBut the truth is that I had\na very happy childhood,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.934\nfull of laughter and love,\nin a very close-knit family.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.169\nBut I also had grandfathers\nwho died in refugee camps.\n\n00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:24.934\nMy cousin Polle died because\nhe could not get adequate healthcare.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.934\nOne of my closest friends,\nOkoloma, died in a plane crash\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.934\nbecause our fire trucks\ndid not have water.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.934\nI grew up under repressive\nmilitary governments\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.934\nthat devalued education,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.934\nso that sometimes, my parents\nwere not paid their salaries.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.935\nAnd so, as a child, I saw jam\ndisappear from the breakfast table,\n\n00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.456\nthen margarine disappeared,\n\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.934\nthen bread became too expensive,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.829\nthen milk became rationed.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.615\nAnd most of all, a kind\nof normalized political fear\n\n00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:56.321\ninvaded our lives.\n\n00:12:57.781 --> 00:12:59.918\nAll of these stories make me who I am.\n\n00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:03.934\nBut to insist on only\nthese negative stories\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.934\nis to flatten my experience\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.622\nand to overlook the many other\nstories that formed me.\n\n00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:13.934\nThe single story creates stereotypes,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:18.934\nand the problem with stereotypes\nis not that they are untrue,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nbut that they are incomplete.\n\n00:13:21.315 --> 00:13:23.918\nThey make one story become the only story.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.530\nOf course, Africa is a continent\nfull of catastrophes:\n\n00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:30.934\nThere are immense ones,\nsuch as the horrific rapes in Congo\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.584\nand depressing ones,\n\n00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:37.108\nsuch as the fact that 5,000 people apply\nfor one job vacancy in Nigeria.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.521\nBut there are other stories\nthat are not about catastrophe,\n\n00:13:41.545 --> 00:13:44.934\nand it is very important, it is just\nas important, to talk about them.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.934\nI've always felt that it is impossible\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.934\nto engage properly\nwith a place or a person\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:53.934\nwithout engaging with all of the stories\nof that place and that person.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.538\nThe consequence\nof the single story is this:\n\n00:13:57.562 --> 00:13:59.519\nIt robs people of dignity.\n\n00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.934\nIt makes our recognition\nof our equal humanity difficult.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:08.122\nIt emphasizes how we are different\nrather than how we are similar.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.447\nSo what if before my Mexican trip,\n\n00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:14.934\nI had followed the immigration\ndebate from both sides,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.934\nthe U.S. and the Mexican?\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.934\nWhat if my mother had told us\nthat Fide's family was poor\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.934\nand hardworking?\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.054\nWhat if we had an African\ntelevision network\n\n00:14:25.078 --> 00:14:28.934\nthat broadcast diverse\nAfrican stories all over the world?\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.289\nWhat the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe\ncalls \"a balance of stories.\"\n\n00:14:33.313 --> 00:14:37.289\nWhat if my roommate knew\nabout my Nigerian publisher,\n\n00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:38.934\nMuhtar Bakare,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.006\na remarkable man who left\nhis job in a bank\n\n00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.935\nto follow his dream\nand start a publishing house?\n\n00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:47.646\nNow, the conventional wisdom\nwas that Nigerians don't read literature.\n\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.924\nHe disagreed.\n\n00:14:48.948 --> 00:14:52.034\nHe felt that people\nwho could read, would read,\n\n00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:55.934\nif you made literature affordable\nand available to them.\n\n00:14:56.624 --> 00:14:58.934\nShortly after he published my first novel,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.934\nI went to a TV station\nin Lagos to do an interview,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.149\nand a woman who worked there\nas a messenger came up to me and said,\n\n00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:07.934\n\"I really liked your novel.\nI didn't like the ending.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.197\nNow, you must write a sequel,\nand this is what will happen ...\"\n\n00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:13.935\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:13.959 -->

"transcript": "I want to start with a game. Okay? And to win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is, all right? So we have two panels here, of colored dots. And one of those dots is the same in the two panels. And you have to tell me which one.Now, I narrowed it down to the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one. So by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one. Show of hands: how many people think it's the gray one? Really? Okay. How many people think it's the green one? And how many people think it's the orange one? Pretty even split.Let's find out what the reality is. Here is the orange one.(Laughter)Here is the green one. And here is the gray one.(Laughter)So for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists. All right?(Laughter)So this is pretty amazing, isn't it? Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another. So for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does. And yet, even at this most fundamental level, context is everything. What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything, but why context is everything. Because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do, but who we are as individuals, and who we are as a society.But first, we have to ask another question, which is, \"What is color for?\" And instead of telling you, I'll just show you. What you see here is a jungle scene, and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect. Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you? And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?(Laughter)Can anyone see it? Anyone? No? Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect. And now you see it.So, color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces, according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect. But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible. Why? Because, as Berkeley tells us, we have no direct access to our physical world, other than through our senses. And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects, but also the color of their illumination, and the color of the space between us and those objects. You vary any one of those parameters, and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.This is a huge problem, because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources. Let me show you what I mean. Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay? And these are two projections from the world. They're identical in every single way. Identical in shape, size, spectral content. They are the same, as far as your eye is concerned. And yet they come from completely different sources. The one on the right comes from a yellow surface, in shadow, oriented facing the left, viewed through a pinkish medium. The one on the left comes from an orange surface, under direct light, facing to the right, viewed through sort of a bluish medium. Completely different meanings, giving rise to the exact same retinal information. And yet it's only the retinal information that we get.So how on Earth do we even see? So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes, remember this: that the light that falls onto your eye, sensory information, is meaningless, because it could mean literally anything. And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally. There's no inherent meaning in information. It's what we do with that information that matters.So, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see. The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning, a significance, by interacting with the world. We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes, like language. I'm going to give you some letter strings, and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.Audience: \"Can you read this?\" \"You are not reading this.\" \"What are you reading?\"Beau Lotto: \"What are you reading?\" Half the letters are missing, right? There's no a priori reason why an \"H\" has to go between that \"W\" and \"A.\" But you put one there. Why? Because in the statistics of your past experience, it would have been useful to do so. So you do so again. And yet you don't put a letter after that first \"T.\" Why? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past. So you don't do it again.So, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality, even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color. So if I could have the lights down up here. I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same. One is simply the flipping of the other. Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red. And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else. We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.(Laughter)But I really want you to learn. And I'll tell you \u2014 don't look anywhere else \u2014 I'll tell you what's happening in your head. Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination. That's what it's learning. Okay? Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes. So why don't you do that now?(Laughter)Can I have the lights up again?I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?(Applause)Why? Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light, and the left one is still under green light. That's your new normal. Okay? So, what does this mean for context? It means I can take two identical squares, put them in light and dark surrounds, and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround. What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter. It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.So I'll show you what I mean. Here we have that exact same illusion. We have two identical tiles on the left, one in a dark surround, one in a light surround. And the same thing over on the right. Now, I'll reveal those two scenes, but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes, except their meaning. And see what happens to your perception.Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite: one very white and one very dark, right? Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same. And yet there is still one on a dark surround, and one on a light surround. Why? Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective \u2014 just the laws of physics. So you see it that way.Whereas on the right, the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light. If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye, then they must be equally reflective. So you see it that way. Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions.This is one I made a few years ago. And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top, and a bright orange tile at the side. That is your perceptual reality. The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.Here you see four gray tiles on your left, seven gray tiles on the right. I'm not going to change those tiles at all, but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene. And see what happens to your perception. The four blue tiles on the left are gray. The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray. They are the same. Okay? Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion. So, here we have \u2014 let's turn this around \u2014 a diamond. And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here, and I'm going to spin it. And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction. Now I want you to keep looking at it. Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye. And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction. Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes? Keep blinking. Every time you blink, it will switch. So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating? How do you know? Your brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely. So depending on where it looks, it flips between the two possibilities.Are we the only ones that see illusions? The answer to this question is no. Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina, sees illusions, does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do. So in my lab we work on bumblebees, because we can completely control their experience, and see how it alters the architecture of their brain. We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.Here you have the hive. You can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle. Those are her daughters, the eggs. They go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube. You'll see one of the bees come out here. You see how she has a little number on her? There's another one coming out, she also has a number on her. Now, they're not born that way, right? We pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep. Then you can superglue little numbers on them.(Laughter)And now, in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers. They land on the flower, stick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water. She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I, will do that about three times, then fly. And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue, but to go where the other bees go. So they copy each other. They can count to five. They can recognize faces. And here she comes down the ladder. And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot, and throw up, and that's honey.(Laughter)Now remember, she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers, but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner? It looks like they're going to green flowers. Now, are they getting it wrong? And the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers. But those are blue flowers under green light. So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle, which is exactly what we do.So, illusions are often used, especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist, \"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.\" Okay, this is complete rubbish. The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here. Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is. We can't. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past. And how we see is by continually redefining normality.So, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently? Well, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound, and we enable people to hear their visual world. And they can navigate the world using their ears.Here's David on the right, and he's holding a camera. On the left is what his camera sees. And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image. That line is broken up into 32 squares. In each square, we calculate the average color. And then we just simply translate that into sound. And now he's going to turn around, close his eyes, and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.(Continuous sound)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)(Sound changes momentarily)Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right? So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired, but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world. But we can also do something else. We can also make music with color. So, working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them. And then we translated these images. And this is one of those images. And this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece orchestra. And this is what it sounds like.(Electronic representation of orchestral music)So, a six-year-old child. Okay?Now, what does all this mean? What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay? We're not defined by our central properties, by the bits that make us up. We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment, by our ecology. And that ecology is necessarily relative, historical and empirical. So, what I'd like to finish with is this over here. Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty. Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.So, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain, I'd like to do this one. So, if we have the lights down. And what we have here \u2014 Can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left, and 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right? So now, what I want to do, I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination, by simply putting a filter behind them. Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right? Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter. I'm going to do the opposite on the left here. I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.Now, some of you will have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right, or your left, is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right. Agreed? Yes? Okay. So they are physically the same. Let's pull the covers off. Now remember \u2014 you know that the middle nine are exactly the same. Do they look the same? No. The question is, \"Is that an illusion?\" And I'll leave you with that.So, thank you very much.(Laughter)(Applause)", "id": 653, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:15.949\nI want to start with a game.

Okay.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.932\nHow many people think it's the green one?\n\n00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.969\nAnd how many people\nthink it's the orange one?\n\n00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.718\nPretty even split.\n\n00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.548\nLet's find out what the reality is.\n\n00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.392\nHere is the orange one.\n\n00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.107\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.282\nHere is the green one.\n\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.171\nAnd here is the gray one.\n\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.757\nSo for all of you who saw that,\nyou're complete realists.\n\n00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:24.399\nAll right?\n\n00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:25.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.729\nSo this is pretty amazing, isn't it?\n\n00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.555\nBecause nearly every living system\n\n00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.487\nhas evolved the ability\nto detect light in one way or another.\n\n00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:35.352\nSo for us, seeing color\n\n00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:37.686\nis one of the simplest things\nthe brain does.\n\n00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.511\nAnd yet, even at this\nmost fundamental level,\n\n00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.154\ncontext is everything.\n\n00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:46.359\nWhat I'm going to talk about\nis not that context is everything,\n\n00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:48.408\nbut why context is everything.\n\n00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.648\nBecause it's answering that question\n\n00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:54.216\nthat tells us not only\nwhy we see what we do,\n\n00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.934\nbut who we are as individuals,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.839\nand who we are as a society.\n\n00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:01.510\nBut first, we have to ask\nanother question,\n\n00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:03.042\nwhich is, \"What is color for?\"\n\n00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.281\nAnd instead of telling you,\nI'll just show you.\n\n00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.934\nWhat you see here is a jungle scene,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.742\nand you see the surfaces\naccording to the amount of light\n\n00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.431\nthat those surfaces reflect.\n\n00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:16.838\nNow, can any of you see the predator\nthat's about to jump out at you?\n\n00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:19.886\nAnd if you haven't seen it yet,\nyou're dead, right?\n\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.911\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:23.273\nCan anyone see it? Anyone? No?\n\n00:02:23.297 --> 00:02:24.766\nNow let's see the surfaces\n\n00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.644\naccording to the quality of light\nthat they reflect.\n\n00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.209\nAnd now you see it.\n\n00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:32.552\nSo, color enables us to see\n\n00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:35.002\nthe similarities and differences\nbetween surfaces,\n\n00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:38.072\naccording to the full spectrum\nof light that they reflect.\n\n00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:39.557\nBut what you've just done\n\n00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:42.621\nis in many respects\nmathematically impossible.\n\n00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:43.892\nWhy?\n\n00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:45.346\nBecause, as Berkeley tells us,\n\n00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.933\nwe have no direct access\nto our physical world,\n\n00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:49.934\nother than through our senses.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.773\nAnd the light that falls onto our eyes\n\n00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:54.059\nis determined by multiple\nthings in the world,\n\n00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.934\nnot only the color of objects,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.934\nbut also the color of their illumination,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.767\nand the color of the space\nbetween us and those objects.\n\n00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.044\nYou vary any one of those parameters,\n\n00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:06.590\nand you'll change the color\nof the light that falls onto your eye.\n\n00:03:08.106 --> 00:03:09.290\nThis is a huge problem,\n\n00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.283\nbecause it means that the same image\n\n00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:15.828\ncould have an infinite number\nof possible real-world sources.\n\n00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:17.193\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.050\nImagine that this\nis the back of your eye, okay?\n\n00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:22.574\nAnd these are two projections\nfrom the world.\n\n00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.061\nThey're identical in every single way.\n\n00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:29.117\nIdentical in shape,\nsize, spectral content.\n\n00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.910\nThey are the same,\nas far as your eye is concerned.\n\n00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:37.050\nAnd yet they come\nfrom completely different sources.\n\n00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:42.679\nThe one on the right\ncomes from a yellow surface,\n\n00:03:42.703 --> 00:03:45.108\nin shadow, oriented facing the left,\n\n00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:48.004\nviewed through a pinkish medium.\n\n00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:51.272\nThe one on the left comes\nfrom an orange surface,\n\n00:03:51.296 --> 00:03:53.479\nunder direct light, facing to the right,\n\n00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.487\nviewed through sort of a bluish medium.\n\n00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:57.686\nCompletely different meanings,\n\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.987\ngiving rise to the exact same\nretinal information.\n\n00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:04.328\nAnd yet it's only the retinal\ninformation that we get.\n\n00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.320\nSo how on Earth do we even see?\n\n00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:11.551\nSo if you remember anything\nin this next 18 minutes,\n\n00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:12.821\nremember this:\n\n00:04:12.845 --> 00:04:14.787\nthat the light that falls onto your eye,\n\n00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:17.234\nsensory information, is meaningless,\n\n00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:19.376\nbecause it could mean literally anything.\n\n00:04:19.956 --> 00:04:23.501\nAnd what's true for sensory information\nis true for information generally.\n\n00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:25.558\nThere's no inherent\nmeaning in information.\n\n00:04:25.582 --> 00:04:27.995\nIt's what we do with that\ninformation that matters.\n\n00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:32.416\nSo, how do we see?\nWell, we see by learning to see.\n\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.979\nThe brain evolved the mechanisms\nfor finding patterns,\n\n00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.043\nfinding relationships in information,\n\n00:04:38.067 --> 00:04:42.265\nand associating those relationships\nwith a behavioral meaning,\n\n00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.154\na significance, by interacting\nwith the world.\n\n00:04:45.178 --> 00:04:46.933\nWe're very aware of this\n\n00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:49.786\nin the form of more cognitive\nattributes, like language.\n\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.843\nI'm going to give you some letter strings,\n\n00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.360\nand I want you to read them\nout for me, if you can.\n\n00:04:54.384 --> 00:04:56.049\nAudience: \"Can you read this?\"\n\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.934\n\"You are not reading this.\"\n\n00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:00.834\n\"What are you reading?\"\n\n00:05:00.858 --> 00:05:04.242\nBeau Lotto: \"What are you reading?\"\nHalf the letters are missing, right?\n\n00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:05.575\nThere's no a priori reason\n\n00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.091\nwhy an \"H\" has to go\nbetween that \"W\" and \"A.\"\n\n00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:09.670\nBut you put one there. Why?\n\n00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:12.050\nBecause in the statistics\nof your past experience,\n\n00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.768\nit would have been useful to do so.\n\n00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.233\nSo you do so again.\n\n00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:17.934\nAnd yet you don't put a letter\nafter that first \"T.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.822\nWhy? Because it wouldn't have been\nuseful in the past.\n\n00:05:20.846 --> 00:05:22.934\nSo you don't do it again.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.827\nSo, let me show you how quickly\nour brains can redefine normality,\n\n00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:29.581\neven at the simplest thing\nthe brain does, which is color.\n\n00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.239\nSo if I could have\nthe lights down up here.\n\n00:05:32.263 --> 00:05:36.062\nI want you to first notice that those\ntwo desert scenes are physically the same.\n\n00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.263\nOne is simply the flipping of the other.\n\n00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:42.352\nNow I want you to look at that dot\n\n00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.933\nbetween the green and the red.\n\n00:05:44.957 --> 00:05:47.934\nAnd I want you to stare at that dot.\nDon't look anywhere else.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.164\nWe're going to look\nat it for about 30 seconds,\n\n00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:52.630\nwhich is a bit of a killer\nin an 18-minute talk.\n\n00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:53.947\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:55.565\nBut I really want you to learn.\n\n00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.890\nAnd I'll tell you -- don't look\nanywhere else --\n\n00:05:57.914 --> 00:05:59.969\nI'll tell you what's\nhappening in your head.\n\n00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:01.260\nYour brain is learning,\n\n00:06:01.284 --> 00:06:04.012\nand it's learning\nthat the right side of its visual field\n\n00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:05.329\nis under red illumination;\n\n00:06:05.353 --> 00:06:08.280\nthe left side of its visual field\nis under green illumination.\n\n00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:11.190\nThat's what it's learning. Okay?\n\n00:06:11.214 --> 00:06:15.893\nNow, when I tell you, I want you to look\nat the dot between the two desert scenes.\n\n00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.932\nSo why don't you do that now?\n\n00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:21.316\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.243\nCan I have the lights up again?\n\n00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:26.733\nI take it from your response\nthey don't look the same anymore, right?\n\n00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:27.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.934\nWhy? Because your brain\nis seeing that same information\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.645\nas if the right one is still\nunder red light,\n\n00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.827\nand the left one is still\nunder green light.\n\n00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:37.216\nThat's your new normal.\n\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.246\nOkay? So, what does this mean for context?\n\n00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.604\nIt means I can take two identical squares,\n\n00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.448\nput them in light and dark surrounds,\n\n00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:46.957\nand the one on the dark surround\nlooks lighter than on the light surround.\n\n00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:50.565\nWhat's significant is not simply the light\nand dark surrounds that matter.\n\n00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.234\nIt's what those light and dark surrounds\nmeant for your behavior in the past.\n\n00:06:54.258 --> 00:06:55.655\nSo I'll show you what I mean.\n\n00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:57.662\nHere we have that exact same illusion.\n\n00:06:57.686 --> 00:06:59.812\nWe have two identical tiles on the left,\n\n00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.122\none in a dark surround,\none in a light surround.\n\n00:07:02.146 --> 00:07:04.225\nAnd the same thing over on the right.\n\n00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.100\nNow, I'll reveal those two scenes,\n\n00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:09.792\nbut I'm not going to change\nanything within those boxes,\n\n00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:10.967\nexcept their meaning.\n\n00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:13.304\nAnd see what happens to your perception.\n\n00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:14.934\nNotice that on the left\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.723\nthe two tiles look nearly\ncompletely opposite:\n\n00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:20.838\none very white and one very dark, right?\n\n00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:24.137\nWhereas on the right,\nthe two tiles look nearly the same.\n\n00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:26.399\nAnd yet there is still one\non a dark surround,\n\n00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:27.788\nand one on a light surround.\n\n00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:28.963\nWhy?\n\n00:07:28.987 --> 00:07:32.934\nBecause if the tile in that shadow\nwere in fact in shadow,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.387\nand reflecting the same\namount of light to your eye\n\n00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.179\nas the one outside the shadow,\n\n00:07:37.203 --> 00:07:40.600\nit would have to be more reflective\n-- just the laws of physics.\n\n00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:42.142\nSo you see it that way.\n\n00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.824\nWhereas on the right,\nthe information is consistent\n\n00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:47.531\nwith those two tiles\nbeing under the same light.\n\n00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:51.388\nIf they're under the same light reflecting\nthe same amount of light to your eye,\n\n00:07:51.412 --> 00:07:53.197\nthen they must be equally reflective.\n\n00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:54.484\nSo you see it that way.\n\n00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:57.034\nWhich means we can bring\nall this information together\n\n00:07:57.058 --> 00:07:59.106\nto create some incredibly\nstrong illusions.\n\n00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.934\nThis is one I made a few years ago.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.271\nAnd you'll notice you see\na dark brown tile at the top,\n\n00:08:04.295 --> 00:08:06.774\nand a bright orange tile at the side.\n\n00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:08.528\nThat is your perceptual reality.\n\n00:08:08.552 --> 00:08:11.516\nThe physical reality\nis that those two tiles are the same.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.934\nHere you see four gray tiles on your left,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.470\nseven gray tiles on the right.\n\n00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:21.551\nI'm not going to change\nthose tiles at all,\n\n00:08:21.575 --> 00:08:23.742\nbut I'm going to reveal\nthe rest of the scene.\n\n00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:25.724\nAnd see what happens to your perception.\n\n00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.828\nThe four blue tiles on the left are gray.\n\n00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:33.505\nThe seven yellow tiles\non the right are also gray.\n\n00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:35.410\nThey are the same. Okay?\n\n00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:37.472\nDon't believe me? Let's watch it again.\n\n00:08:39.356 --> 00:08:43.610\nWhat's true for color is also true\nfor complex perceptions of motion.\n\n00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:46.443\nSo, here we have --\n\n00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.731\nlet's turn this around -- a diamond.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.578\nAnd what I'm going to do is,\nI'm going to hold it here,\n\n00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:55.448\nand I'm going to spin it.\n\n00:08:56.789 --> 00:08:59.933\nAnd for all of you, you'll see it\nprobably spinning this direction.\n\n00:08:59.957 --> 00:09:02.569\nNow I want you to keep looking at it.\n\n00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:05.093\nMove your eyes around,\nblink, maybe close one eye.\n\n00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:08.934\nAnd suddenly it will flip, and start\nspinning the opposite direction.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.130\nYes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?\n\n00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:13.361\nKeep blinking.\n\n00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.970\nEvery time you blink, it will switch.\n\n00:09:15.994 --> 00:09:18.591\nSo I can ask you,\nwhich direction is it rotating?\n\n00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.385\nHow do you know?\n\n00:09:22.098 --> 00:09:25.208\nYour brain doesn't know,\nbecause both are equally likely.\n\n00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:26.770\nSo depending on where it looks,\n\n00:09:26.794 --> 00:09:30.123\nit flips between the two possibilities.\n\n00:09:30.147 --> 00:09:32.071\nAre we the only ones that see illusions?\n\n00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:33.934\nThe answer to this question is no.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.677\nEven the beautiful bumblebee,\n\n00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.575\nwith its mere one million brain cells,\n\n00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.614\nwhich is 250 times fewer cells\nthan you have in one retina,\n\n00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:44.466\nsees illusions, does\nthe most complicated things\n\n00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.934\nthat even our most\nsophisticated computers can't do.\n\n00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.155\nSo in my lab we work on bumblebees,\n\n00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.668\nbecause we can completely\ncontrol their experience,\n\n00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:54.225\nand see how it alters\nthe architecture of their brain.\n\n00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:56.350\nWe do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.\n\n00:09:56.374 --> 00:09:57.648\nHere you have the hive.\n\n00:09:57.672 --> 00:10:00.267\nYou can see the queen bee,\nthe large bee in the middle.\n\n00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:01.917\nThose are her daughters, the eggs.\n\n00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:05.556\nThey go back and forth between this hive\nand the arena, via this tube.\n\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.387\nYou'll see one of the bees come out here.\n\n00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:13.505\nYou see how she has\na little number on her?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.894\nThere's another one coming out,\nshe also has a number on her.\n\n00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.654\nNow, they're not born that way, right?\n\n00:10:19.678 --> 00:10:22.693\nWe pull them out, put them\nin the fridge, and they fall asleep.\n\n00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:25.010\nThen you can superglue\nlittle numbers on them.\n\n00:10:25.034 --> 00:10:26.217\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:29.934\nAnd now, in this experiment they get\na reward if they go to the blue flowers.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.151\nThey land on the flower,\n\n00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.684\nstick their tongue in there,\ncalled a proboscis, and drink sugar water.\n\n00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:37.866\nShe's drinking a glass of water\nthat's about that big to you and I,\n\n00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.524\nwill do that about three times, then fly.\n\n00:10:43.864 --> 00:10:46.142\nAnd sometimes they learn\nnot to go to the blue,\n\n00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:47.934\nbut to go where the other bees go.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.172\nSo they copy each other.\n\n00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:51.482\nThey can count to five.\nThey can recognize faces.\n\n00:10:51.506 --> 00:10:53.467\nAnd here she comes down the ladder.\n\n00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.072\nAnd she'll come into the hive,\nfind an empty honey pot,\n\n00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:58.153\nand throw up, and that's honey.\n\n00:10:58.177 --> 00:10:59.328\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:59.352 --> 00:11:04.162\nNow remember, she's supposed\nto be going to the blue flowers,\n\n00:11:04.186 --> 00:11:06.813\nbut what are these bees doing\nin the upper right corner?\n\n00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:09.326\nIt looks like they're\ngoing to green flowers.\n\n00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.156\nNow, are they getting it wrong?\n\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.672\nAnd the answer to the question is no.\nThose are actually blue flowers.\n\n00:11:15.696 --> 00:11:19.259\nBut those are blue flowers\nunder green light.\n\n00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:23.015\nSo they're using the relationships\nbetween the colors to solve the puzzle,\n\n00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.110\nwhich is exactly what we do.\n\n00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:27.465\nSo, illusions are often used,\n\n00:11:27.489 --> 00:11:31.100\nespecially in art, in the words\nof a more contemporary artist,\n\n00:11:31.124 --> 00:11:33.584\n\"to demonstrate the fragility\nof our senses.\"\n\n00:11:33.608 --> 00:11:35.932\nOkay, this is complete rubbish.\n\n00:11:35.956 --> 00:11:39.906\nThe senses aren't fragile.\nAnd if they were, we wouldn't be here.\n\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.829\nInstead, color tells us\nsomething completely different,\n\n00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:46.221\nthat the brain didn't actually evolve\nto see the world the way it is.\n\n00:11:46.245 --> 00:11:47.456\nWe can't.\n\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.892\nInstead, the brain\nevolved to see the world\n\n00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:52.934\nthe way it was useful to see in the past.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:57.129\nAnd how we see is by continually\nredefining normality.\n\n00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:06.320\nSo, how can we take this incredible\ncapacity of plasticity of the brain\n\n00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.868\nand get people to experience\ntheir world differently?\n\n00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:11.589\nWell, one of the ways we do it\nin my lab and studio\n\n00:12:11.613 --> 00:12:14.851\nis we translate the light into sound,\n\n00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:17.949\nand we enable people to hear\ntheir visual world.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.616\nAnd they can navigate\nthe world using their ears.\n\n00:12:22.223 --> 00:12:25.579\nHere's David on the right,\nand he's holding a camera.\n\n00:12:25.603 --> 00:12:27.333\nOn the left is what his camera sees.\n\n00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:30.365\nAnd you'll see there's a faint line\ngoing across that image.\n\n00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:32.798\nThat line is broken up into 32 squares.\n\n00:12:32.822 --> 00:12:35.149\nIn each square,\nwe calculate the average color.\n\n00:12:35.173 --> 00:12:37.554\nAnd then we just simply\ntranslate that into sound.\n\n00:12:37.578 --> 00:12:40.811\nAnd now he's going to turn around,\n\n00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:43.695\nclose his eyes,\n\n00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:46.981\nand find a plate on the ground\nwith his eyes closed.\n\n00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:48.229\n(Continuous sound)\n\n00:12:49.962 --> 00:12:51.290\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.450\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.171\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:12:59.378 --> 00:13:01.215\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:04.921\n(Sound changes momentarily)\n\n00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:07.512\nBeau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?\n\n00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:10.599\nSo not only can we create a prosthetic\nfor the visually impaired,\n\n00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:13.106\nbut we can also investigate\n\n00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.826\nhow people literally\nmake sense of the world.\n\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.485\nBut we can also do something else.\n\n00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:20.597\nWe can also make music with color.\n\n00:13:20.621 --> 00:13:22.297\nSo, working with kids,\n\n00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:24.114\nthey created images,\n\n00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:26.254\nthinking about what might\nthe images you see\n\n00:13:26.278 --> 00:13:28.102\nsound like if we could listen to them.\n\n00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:29.934\nAnd then we translated these images.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.934\nAnd this is one of those images.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.934\nAnd this is a six-year-old child\ncomposing a piece of music\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.934\nfor a 32-piece orchestra.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.959\nAnd this is what it sounds like.\n\n00:13:39.983 --> 00:13:46.661\n(Electronic representation\nof orchestral music)\n\n00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.814\nSo, a six-year-old child. Okay?\n\n00:14:08.838 --> 00:14:10.955\nNow, what does all this mean?\n\n00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:16.891\nWhat this suggests is that no one\nis an outside observer of nature, okay?\n\n00:14:16.915 --> 00:14:18.980\nWe're not defined\nby our central properties,\n\n00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:20.668\nby the bits that make us up.\n\n00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:24.366\nWe're defined by our environment\nand our interaction with that environment,\n\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.042\nby our ecology.\n\n00:14:26.066 --> 00:14:32.098\nAnd that ecology is necessarily\nrelative, historical and empirical.\n\n00:14:34.003 --> 00:14:38.264\nSo, what I'd like to finish with\nis this over here.\n\n00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:41.549\nBecause what I've been trying to do\nis really celebrate uncertainty.\n\n00:14:41.573 --> 00:14:45.334\nBecause I think only through uncertainty\nis there potential for understanding.\n\n00:14:45.358 --> 00:14:48.226\nSo, if some of you are still\nfeeling a bit too certain,\n\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.792\nI'd like to do this one.\n\n00:14:49.816 --> 00:14:52.230\nSo, if we have the lights down.\n\n00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:57.136\nAnd what we have here --\n\n00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:03.114\nCan everyone see 25\npurple surfaces on your left,\n\n00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:07.330\nand 25, call it yellowish,\nsurfaces on your right?\n\n00:15:07.354 --> 00:15:08.668\nSo now, what I want to do,\n\n00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:11.709\nI'm going to put\nthe middle nine surfaces here\n\n00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:13.360\nunder yellow illumination,\n\n00:15:13.384 --> 00:15:15.390\nby simply putting a filter behind them.\n\n00:15:17.852 --> 00:15:21.823\nNow you can see that changes the light\nthat's coming through there, right?\n\n00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:24.928\nBecause now the light is going\nthrough a yellowish filter\n\n00:15:24.952 --> 00:15:26.499\nand then a purplish filter.\n\n00:15:26.523 --> 00:15:30.834\nI'm going to do the opposite\non the left here.\n\n00:15:30.858 --> 00:15:36.525\nI'm going to put the middle nine\nunder a purplish light.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.495\nNow, some of you will have noticed\nthat the consequence\n\n00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:45.582\nis that the light coming through those\nmiddle nine on the right,\n\n00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:48.414\nor your left, is exactly\nthe same as the light\n\n00:15:48.438 --> 00:15:51.130\ncoming through the middle\nnine on your right.\n\n00:15:51.154 --> 00:15:53.739\nAgreed? Yes?\n\n00:15:53.763 --> 00:15:56.312\nOkay. So they are physically the same.\n\n00:15:56.336 --> 00:15:58.974\nLet's pull the covers off.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.299\nNow remember --\n\n00:16:05.662 --> 00:16:09.381\nyou know that the middle nine\nare exactly the same.\n\n00:16:09.405 --> 00:16:10.624\nDo they look the same?\n\n00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.415\nNo.\n\n00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:15.394\nThe question is, \"Is that an illusion?\"\n\n00:16:15.418 --> 00:16:16.825\nAnd I'll leave you with that.\n\n00:16:16.849 --> 00:16:18.054\nSo, thank you very much.\n\n00:16:18.078 --> 00:16:19.243\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:21.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Claim your \"manspace\"", "duration": "267", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_martin_builds_a_room_of_his_own", "transcript": "So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here. I'm here for two reasons. These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren. When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space. My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half. And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own. There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard, and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space. It had everything I needed. It was quiet. There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.As I was building this space, I thought to myself, \"Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own.\" So I did some research. And I found that there was an historic precedence. Hemingway had his writing space. Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland. In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave.So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now. Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from. On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage. But on the inside, it's anything but. And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace. It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important.I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside. This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf. And he found the scoreboard in the trash.Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated. This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir. The guy did it all himself. And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs. There were definitely hang-out spots. But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things. Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.Take this place for example. On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage. This is in Long Island, New York. The only thing that might tip you off is the round window. On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house. The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style. It has no nails or screws. All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood. But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside. (Laughter) And so there is a good reason for this. It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough. He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space. He trains other people. And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace.So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion. It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship. It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s. Museum quality.So, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces. And they were unexpected and they were surprising. But they were also \u2014 I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them. And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did. And they really loved their professions. And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies. And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were.So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it. Thank you very much.

Cities, past and future. In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll and look in the looking glass that is New York City to try and see our true selves, or perhaps pass through to another world. Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, \"As the moon rose higher, the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes, a fresh green breast of the new world.\"My colleagues and I have been working for 10 years to rediscover this lost world in a project we call The Mannahatta Project. We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609, when he sailed into New York harbor. And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts, and if I have time still, an epilogue.So, Act I: A Map Found. So, I didn't grow up in New York. I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here, in the Red Rock Canyon. And from these early experiences as a child I learned to love landscapes. And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies, I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology. Landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals. This experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world. And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City. And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, \"How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals? How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?\" I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall, and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them. I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park come up against the abrupt and sheer topography of midtown Manhattan.I started reading about the history and the geography in New York City. I read that New York City was the first mega-city, a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950. I started seeing paintings like this. For those of you who are from New York, this is 125th street under the West Side Highway. (Laughter) It was once a beach. And this painting has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock. And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village. Those are two students at King's College \u2014 later Columbia University \u2014 sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley. And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree. What's that palm tree doing there? (Laughter)So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map. And it's this map you see here. It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in. This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City. And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew. And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan you can see the extent of New York City as it was, right at the end of the American Revolution. Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway. And this is City Hall Park. So the city basically extended to City Hall Park. And just beyond it you can see features that have vanished, things that have disappeared. This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City for its first 200 years, and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that. You can see the Lispenard Meadows draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now, and the beaches that come up from the Battery, all the way to 42nd St.This map was made for military reasons. They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications that they built. But they're also mapping things of ecological interest, also military interest: the hills, the marshes, the streams. This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water, which used to run its way through Greenwich Village. Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here. Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house on Murray Hill, 200 years ago. Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.So I saw this remarkable map in a book. And I thought to myself, \"You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat.\" So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is. We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams, and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today. So this is fun for finding where things are relative to the old topography.But I had another idea about this map. If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings, and if we take away the open spaces, then we could take this map. If we pull off the 18th century features we could drive it back in time. We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals: to the hills, to the streams, to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches, the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.Then, if we added maps like the geology, the bedrock geology, and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave, if we make the soil map, with the 17 soil classes, that are defined by the National Conservation Service, if we make a digital elevation model of the topography that tells us how high the hills were, then we can calculate the slopes. We can calculate the aspect. We can calculate the winter wind exposure \u2014 so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape. The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.We compiled all the information about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape. And we built a probability map of where they might have been. So, the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan, places that are close to water, places that are near the harbor to fish, places protected from the winter winds. We know that there was a Lenape settlement down here by the Collect Pond. And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture, that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash, the \"Three Sisters\" garden.So, we built a model that explains where those fields might have been. And the old fields, the successional fields that go. And we might think of these as abandoned. But, in fact, they're grassland habitats for grassland birds and plants. And they have become successional shrub lands, and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities. And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types. You can think of these as neighborhoods, as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood \u2014 that these are the forest and the wetlands and the marine communities, the beaches.And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis, Manhattan had more ecological communities per acre than Yosemite does, than Yellowstone, than Amboseli. It was really an extraordinary landscape that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed. So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees, the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan, the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore, the beavers on all the streams, the black bears, and the Native Americans, to study how they used and thought about their landscape. We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did was we mapped their habitat needs.Where do they get their food? Where do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter? Where do they get their reproductive resources? To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat, but to most people, the intersection of these is their home. So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves, you know, what beavers need is, \"A slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows, near the water.\" That's the best thing for a beaver.So we just started making a list. Here is the beaver. And here is the stream, and the aspen and the alder and the willow. As if these were the maps that we would need to predict where you would find the beaver. Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places. Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites. And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs. But a beaver also needs things. And that having it on either side means that we can link it together, that we can create the network of the habitat relationships for these species.Moreover, we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist, but you can look up what an aspen needs. An aspen needs fire and dry soils. And you can look at what a wet meadow needs. And it need beavers to create the wetlands, and maybe some other things. But you can also talk about sunny places. So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se. But what are the conditions that make it possible? Or fire. Or dry soils. And that you can put these on a grid that's 1,000 columns long across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way. And then we can visualize this data like a network, like a social network.And this is the network of all the habitat relationships of all the plants and animals on Manhattan, and everything they needed, going back to the geology, going back to time and space at the very core of the web. We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this. Each point is a different species or a different stream or a different soil type. And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together. They are the connections that actually make nature resilient. And the structure of this is what makes nature work, seen with all its parts. We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist John Muir, who said, \"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe.\"So then we took the Muir webs and we took them back to the maps. So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th, and Lex and Third, maybe there was a stream in that block. And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there, and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses, the butterflies, the fish in the stream, the birds in the trees. Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there. And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there. And then we took this data.You can see this for yourself on our website. You can zoom into any block on Manhattan, and see what might have been there 400 years ago. And we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in Act III. We used the tools they use in Hollywood to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue. So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography. We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape. We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities. And feed into that the map of the species. So that we would actually take a photograph, flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River, waiting for Hudson to come. Using this technology, we can make these fantastic georeferenced views. We can basically take a picture out of any window on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.This is the view from the East River, looking up Murray Hill at where the United Nations is today. This is the view looking down the Hudson River, with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right, looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean. This is the view over Times Square, with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east. So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind. We can see the fields that the Native Americans made. And we can see this in the geography of the city today. So when you're watching \"Law and Order,\" and the lawyers walk up the steps they could have walked back down those steps of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond, 400 years ago.So these images are the work of my friend and colleague, Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today. And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work. (Applause)There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass. And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place. The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity. It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.But I wouldn't have you think that I don't like the place on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city and its kind of diversity, and its resilience, and its dependence on density and how we're connected together. In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other, much as Lewis Carroll did in \"Through the Looking Glass.\" We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time, that they really are the same place, that there is no way that cities can escape from nature. And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue, not about the past, but about 400 years from now, what we're realizing is that cities are habitats for people, and need to supply what people need: a sense of home, food, water, shelter, reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning. This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity. And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning, about bringing meaning to our lives in all kinds of different ways, through technology, through art, through science, so much so that I think we focus so much on that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough attention to the food and the water and the shelter, and what we need to raise the kids.So, how can we envision the city of the future? Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park, and we imagine it without all the cars, and bicycles instead and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains? What if we imagined the Upper East Side with green roofs, and streams winding through the city, and windmills supplying the power we need? Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area, currently home to 12 million people, but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan, in only 36 percent of the area, with the areas in between covered by farmland, covered by wetlands, covered by the marshes we need.This is the kind of future I think we need, is a future that has the same diversity and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan, but that learns from the sustainability of the past, of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts. Thank you very much.

00:01:07.958\nand if I have time still, an epilogue.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nSo, Act I: A Map Found.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nSo, I didn't grow up in New York.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI grew up out west in the\nSierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nin the Red Rock Canyon.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nAnd from these early\nexperiences as a child\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI learned to love landscapes.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd so when it became time\nfor me to do my graduate studies,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nI studied this emerging field\nof landscape ecology.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nLandscape ecology concerns itself\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwith how the stream and the meadow\nand the forest and the cliffs\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nmake habitats for plants and animals.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThis experience and this training\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nlead me to get a wonderful job\nwith the Wildlife Conservation Society,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwhich works to save wildlife\nand wild places all over the world.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd over the last decade,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nI traveled to over 40 countries\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nto see jaguars and bears and elephants\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand tigers and rhinos.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nBut every time I would return\nfrom my trips I'd return back to New York City.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd on my weekends I would go up,\njust like all the other tourists,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nto the top of the Empire State Building,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nand I'd look down on this landscape,\non these ecosystems,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand I'd wonder, \"How does this landscape\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nwork to make habitat\nfor plants and animals?\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nHow does it work to make habitat\nfor animals like me?\"\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI'd go to Times Square and I'd look\nat the amazing ladies on the wall,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand wonder why nobody is looking\nat the historical figures just behind them.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nI'd go to Central Park and see\nthe rolling topography of Central Park\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\ncome up against the abrupt and sheer\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ntopography of midtown Manhattan.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nI started reading about the history\nand the geography in New York City.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nI read that New York City\nwas the first mega-city,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\na city of 10 million people\nor more, in 1950.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI started seeing paintings like this.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nFor those of you who are from New York,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthis is 125th street\nunder the West Side Highway.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIt was once a beach.\nAnd this painting\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nhas John James Audubon,\nthe painter, sitting on the rock.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nAnd it's looking up on the wooded heights\nof Washington Heights\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nto Jeffrey's Hook, where the George\nWashington Bridge goes across today.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nOr this painting, from the 1740s,\nfrom Greenwich Village.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThose are two students at King's College --\nlater Columbia University --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nsitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd so I'd go down to Greenwich\nVillage and I'd look for this hill,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand I couldn't find it.\nAnd I couldn't find that palm tree.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nWhat's that palm tree doing there?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo, it was in the course of these investigations\nthat I ran into a map.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd it's this map you see here.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIt's held in a geographic information system\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhich allows me to zoom in.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThis map isn't from Hudson's time,\nbut from the American Revolution,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n170 years later, made by\nBritish military cartographers\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nduring the occupation of New York City.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd it's a remarkable map.\nIt's in the National Archives here in Kew.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd it's 10 feet long and\nthree and a half feet wide.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd if I zoom in to lower Manhattan\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nyou can see the extent\nof New York City as it was,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nright at the end of the American Revolution.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHere's Bowling Green.\nAnd here's Broadway.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd this is City Hall Park.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo the city basically extended\nto City Hall Park.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd just beyond it you can see features\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat have vanished,\nthings that have disappeared.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThis is the Collect Pond, which was\nthe fresh water source for New York City\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfor its first 200 years,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand for the Native Americans\nfor thousands of years before that.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nYou can see the Lispenard Meadows\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\ndraining down through here,\nthrough what is TriBeCa now,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand the beaches that\ncome up from the Battery,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nall the way to 42nd St.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThis map was made for military reasons.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThey're mapping the roads,\nthe buildings, these fortifications\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthat they built.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nBut they're also mapping\nthings of ecological interest,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nalso military interest: the hills,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthe marshes, the streams.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThis is Richmond Hill,\nand Minetta Water,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwhich used to run its way\nthrough Greenwich Village.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nOr the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nOr Murray Hill.\nAnd this is the Murrays' house\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\non Murray Hill, 200 years ago.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nHere is Times Square,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthe two streams that came\ntogether to make a wetland\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nin Times Square, as it was\nat the end of the American Revolution.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo I saw this remarkable map in a book.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd I thought to myself, \"You know,\nif I could georeference this map,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nif I could place this map\nin the grid of the city today,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nI could find these lost features\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nof the city,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nin the block-by-block\ngeography that people know,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthe geography of where people\ngo to work, and where they go to live,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand where they like to eat.\"\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo, after some work\nwe were able to georeference it,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhich allows us to put\nthe modern streets on the city,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand the buildings, and the open spaces,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nso that we can zoom in\nto where the Collect Pond is.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nWe can digitize the Collect\nPond and the streams,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand see where they actually are\nin the geography of the city today.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo this is fun\nfor finding where things are\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nrelative to the old topography.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBut I had another idea about this map.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIf we take away the streets,\nand if we take away the buildings,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand if we take away the open spaces,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthen we could take this map.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nIf we pull off the 18th century features\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwe could drive it back in time.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe could drive it back\nto its ecological fundamentals:\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto the hills, to the streams,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nto the basic hydrology\nand shoreline, to the beaches,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nthe basic aspects that\nmake the ecological landscape.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThen, if we added maps\nlike the geology, the bedrock geology,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand the surface geology,\nwhat the glaciers leave,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nif we make the soil map,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwith the 17 soil classes,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthat are defined by\nthe National Conservation Service,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nif we make a digital elevation model\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nof the topography\nthat tells us how high the hills were,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthen we can calculate the slopes.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nWe can calculate the aspect.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe can calculate the\nwinter wind exposure --\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nso, which way the winter\nwinds blow across the landscape.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe white areas on this map\nare the places protected from the winter winds.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe compiled all the information\nabout where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd we built a probability map\nof where they might have been.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, the red areas\non this map indicate the places\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat are best for human\nsustainability on Manhattan,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nplaces that are close to water,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nplaces that are near the harbor to fish,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nplaces protected from the winter winds.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWe know that there was a Lenape settlement\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\ndown here by the Collect Pond.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd we knew that they\nplanted a kind of horticulture,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthat they grew these beautiful gardens\nof corn, beans, and squash,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthe \"Three Sisters\" garden.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, we built a model that explains\nwhere those fields might have been.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nAnd the old fields, the successional fields that go.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd we might think of these as abandoned.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, in fact, they're grassland habitats\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nfor grassland birds and plants.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd they have become\nsuccessional shrub lands,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand these then mix in\nto a map of all the ecological communities.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd it turns out that Manhattan\nhad 55 different ecosystem types.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nYou can think of these as neighborhoods,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nas distinctive as TriBeCa\nand the Upper East Side and Inwood --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthat these are the forest and the wetlands\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand the marine communities, the beaches.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nManhattan had more ecological communities\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nper acre than Yosemite does,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nthan Yellowstone, than Amboseli.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt was really an extraordinary landscape\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat was capable of supporting\nan extraordinary biodiversity.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo, we studied the fish and the frogs\nand the birds and the bees,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthe 85 different kinds of fish\nthat were on Manhattan,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nthe Heath hens, the species\nthat aren't there anymore,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthe beavers on all the streams,\nthe black bears,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand the Native Americans,\nto study how they used\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand thought about their landscape.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWe wanted to try and map these.\nAnd to do that what we did\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwas we mapped their habitat needs.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhere do they get their food?\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWhere do they get their water?\nWhere do they get their shelter?\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nWhere do they get their\nreproductive resources?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nTo an ecologist, the intersection\nof these is habitat,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut to most people,\nthe intersection of these is their home.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, we would read in field guides,\nthe standard field guides\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nthat maybe you have on your shelves,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nyou know, what beavers need is,\n\"A slowly meandering stream\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwith aspen trees and alders and willows,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nnear the water.\"\nThat's the best thing for a beaver.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo we just started making a list.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nHere is the beaver.\nAnd here is the stream,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand the aspen and the alder\nand the willow.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAs if these were the maps\nthat we would need\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto predict where you would find the beaver.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nOr the bog turtle, needing wet meadows\nand insects and sunny places.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nOr the bobcat, needing rabbits\nand beavers and den sites.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd rapidly we started to realize\nthat beavers can be\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nsomething that a bobcat needs.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBut a beaver also needs things.\nAnd that having it\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\non either side means that\nwe can link it together,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat we can create the network\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nof the habitat relationships\nfor these species.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nMoreover, we realized\nthat you can start out\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nas being a beaver specialist,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbut you can look up what an aspen needs.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAn aspen needs fire and dry soils.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd you can look at\nwhat a wet meadow needs.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd it need beavers\nto create the wetlands,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand maybe some other things.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut you can also talk\nabout sunny places.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo, what does a sunny place need?\nNot habitat per se.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBut what are the conditions\nthat make it possible?\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOr fire. Or dry soils.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd that you can put these\non a grid that's 1,000 columns long\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nacross the top and 1,000 rows\ndown the other way.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd then we can visualize\nthis data like a network,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nlike a social network.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd this is the network\nof all the habitat relationships\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nof all the plants and animals\non Manhattan,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand everything they needed,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\ngoing back to the geology,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\ngoing back to time and space\nat the very core of the web.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nWe call this the Muir Web.\nAnd if you zoom in on it it looks like this.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nEach point is a different species\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nor a different stream\nor a different soil type.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nAnd those little gray lines are the connections\nthat connect them together.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nThey are the connections\nthat actually make nature resilient.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nAnd the structure of this\nis what makes nature work,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nseen with all its parts.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWe call these Muir Webs\nafter the Scottish-American naturalist\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nJohn Muir, who said, \"When we try\nto pick out anything by itself,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwe find that it's bound fast\nby a thousand invisible cords\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat cannot be broken,\nto everything in the universe.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nSo then we took the Muir webs\nand we took them back to the maps.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nSo if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand Lex and Third,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nmaybe there was a stream in that block.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd these would be the kind of trees\nthat might have been there,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand the flowers and the lichens\nand the mosses,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthe butterflies, the fish in the stream,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nthe birds in the trees.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nMaybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd perhaps a black bear walked by.\nAnd maybe Native Americans were there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd then we took this data.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nYou can see this for yourself\non our website.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nYou can zoom into\nany block on Manhattan,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand see what might have\nbeen there 400 years ago.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd we used it to try\nand reveal a landscape\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nhere in Act III.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nWe used the tools they use in Hollywood\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nto make these fantastic landscapes\nthat we all see in the movies.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo we would take the landscape\nand we would build up the topography.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWe'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,\nand illuminate the landscape.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe would lay on top of that\nthe map of the ecological communities.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd feed into that the map of the species.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo that we would actually take a photograph,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nflying above Times Square,\nlooking toward the Hudson River,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwaiting for Hudson to come.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nUsing this technology, we can make these\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nfantastic georeferenced views.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nWe can basically take a picture\nout of any window\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\non Manhattan and see what that landscape\nlooked like 400 years ago.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThis is the view from the East River,\nlooking up Murray Hill\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nat where the United Nations is today.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nThis is the view looking\ndown the Hudson River,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nwith Manhattan on the left,\nand New Jersey out on the right,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nlooking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThis is the view over Times Square,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwith the beaver pond there,\nlooking out toward the east.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nSo we can see the Collect Pond,\nand Lispenard Marshes back behind.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nWe can see the fields\nthat the Native Americans made.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd we can see this\nin the geography of the city today.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nSo when you're watching \"Law and Order,\"\nand the lawyers walk up the steps\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nthey could have walked\nback down those steps\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nof the New York Court House,\nright into the Collect Pond,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\n400 years ago.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSo these images are the work\nof my friend and colleague,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nMark Boyer, who is here\nin the audience today.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd I'd just like, if you would\ngive him a hand,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nto call out for his fine work.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThere is such power in bringing\nscience and visualization together,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat we can create images like this,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nperhaps looking on either\nside of a looking glass.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd even though I've only\nhad a brief time to speak,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nI hope you appreciate that\nMannahatta was a very special place.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe place that you see here\non the left side\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nwas interconnected.\nIt was based on this diversity.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIt had this resilience that is\nwhat we need in our modern world.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nBut I wouldn't have you think\nthat I don't like the place\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\non the right, which I quite do.\nI've come to love the city\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand its kind of diversity,\nand its resilience,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand its dependence on density\nand how we're connected together.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nIn fact, that I see them\nas reflections of each other,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nmuch as Lewis Carroll did\nin \"Through the Looking Glass.\"\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWe can compare these two and hold them\nin our minds at the same time,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthat they really are the same place,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthat there is no way that cities\ncan escape from nature.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nAnd I think this is what we're learning\nabout building cities in the future.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,\nnot about the past,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut about 400 years from now,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhat we're realizing is that\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\ncities are habitats for people,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nand need to supply what people need:\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\na sense of home, food, water, shelter,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nreproductive resources,\nand a sense of meaning.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThis is the particular additional\nhabitat requirement of humanity.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd so many of the talks here\nat TED are about meaning,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nabout bringing meaning to our lives\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nin all kinds of different ways, through technology,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthrough art, through science,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nso much so that I think\nwe focus so much on\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthat side of our lives,\nthat we haven't given enough\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nattention to the food and the water\nand the shelter,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand what we need to raise the kids.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nSo, how can we envision\nthe city of the future?\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWell, what if we go\nto Madison Square Park,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand we imagine it without all the cars,\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nand bicycles instead\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nand large forests, and streams instead\nof sewers and storm drains?\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nWhat if we imagined the Upper East Side\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nwith green roofs, and streams\nwinding through the city,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand windmills supplying\nthe power we need?\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nOr if we imagine the New York\nCity metropolitan area,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\ncurrently home to 12 million people,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nbut 12 million people in the future,\nperhaps living at the density of Manhattan,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nin only 36 percent of the area,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwith the areas in between\ncovered by farmland,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\ncovered by wetlands,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\ncovered by the marshes we need.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis is the kind of future I think we need,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nis a future that has the same diversity\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nbut that learns from the\nsustainability of the past,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nof the ecology, the original ecology,\nof nature with all its parts.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Robots that \"show emotion\"", "duration": "297", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_hanson_robots_that_relate_to_you",

And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids. So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen. One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making. It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation. We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.In fact, right now \u2014 plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling. (Laughter) Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay, here we go. Oh, it's so sad. Okay, so you smile, frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing. Right? Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy. So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D. And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.So, we're involving two things. One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to believe that it's alive and aware.So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" which was the basis of the movie \"Bladerunner.\" In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him. And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence. And we're getting this mass-manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids. Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years. As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.

Normally, as an advertising man, I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills. It's held every two years in Burma. And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again. (Laughter)But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business, that what we create in advertising, which is intangible value \u2014 you might call it perceived value, you might call it badge value, subjective value, intangible value of some kind \u2014 gets rather a bad rap. If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices. You can either live in a world which is poorer, which people in general don't like. Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value, that actually intangible value, in many ways is a very, very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things.Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris. The question was given to a bunch of engineers, about 15 years ago, \"How do we make the journey to Paris better?\" And they came up with a very good engineering solution, which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast, and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time. Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ... ... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter. Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion. What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus for the entire duration of the journey. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change, and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down. (Laughter)Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again. And this shows that engineers, medical people, scientific people, have an obsession with solving the problems of reality, when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth in society, most problems are actually problems of perception. So I'll ask you another question. What on earth is wrong with placebos? They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop. They work extraordinarily well. They have no side effects, or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them. (Laughter)So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it. Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further, and actually produce placebo education. The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things. It actually works by giving you the impression that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence, which then makes you very, very successful in later life. So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen. (Laughter) (Applause)But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting. How many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception, rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality? Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings, but doing a bit of historical research, it seems to be Fredrick the Great. Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it, because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate, wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread. And you get a far lower risk of famine, because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting. And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables \u2014 rather like contemporary Scottish people. (Laughter) So, actually, he tried making it compulsory. The Prussian peasantry said, \"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things. They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.\" There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes.So he tried plan B. He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it. And he planted it in a royal potato patch, with guards who had instructions to guard over it, night and day, but with secret instructions not to guard it very well. (Laughter) Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding, it's worth stealing. Before long, there was a massive underground potato-growing operation in Germany. What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato. It was an absolute masterpiece.I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said, \"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.\" Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy, was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil, in Turkey, to modernize it. Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil. But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance. Ataturk was a lateral thinker. He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil. (Laughter) (Applause)I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter. There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys: All convicted child molesters have to drive a Porsche Cayenne. (Laughter) What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things. Which is that, actually, first one, all value is actually relative. All value is perceived value.For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja \u2014 it's actually the Spanish for \"orange juice.\" Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists. As an advertising man, I have to admire that.But the first thing is that all value is subjective. Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion. These funny signs that flash your speed at you, some of the new ones, on the bottom right, now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face, to act as an emotional trigger. What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera, but they prevent twice as many accidents. So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling to conventional, classically trained economists, is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a \u00a360 fine and three penalty points.Tiny little behavioral economics detail: in Italy, penalty points go backwards. You start with 12 and they take them away. Because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on people's behavior. In Britain we tend to feel, \"Whoa! Got another three!\" Not so in Italy.Another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what, after all, the environmental movement needs to be about: This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813. The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French, were encouraged to give in all their jewelry. And it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron. Here's one: \"Gold gab ich f\u00fcr Eisen, 1813.\" The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence, the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia wasn't made of gold or diamonds. It was made of cast iron. Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry. This actually had symbolic value, badge value. It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.So, the modern equivalent would of course be this. (Laughter) But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods, where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare \u2014 there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement. Adam Smith talks about 18th century America, where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great, it was almost a block in the economy in New England, because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors. It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies.What's also interesting, if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value, a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value: They are often quite egalitarian. In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value. Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos, and you may not like the Coca-Cola company, but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke. What Warhol said about Coke is, he said, \"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street.\" Now, that is, actually, when you think about it \u2014 we take it for granted \u2014 it's actually a remarkable achievement, to produce something that's that democratic.Now, we basically have to change our views slightly. There is a basic view that real value involves making things, involves labor. It involves engineering. It involves limited raw materials. And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version. And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it. It patently veers toward propaganda. However, what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food. You had a monopoly supplier. On the left, you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC. (Laughter) And on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it. (Laughter)Nowadays, the user is actually involved. This is actually what's called, in the digital world, \"user-generated content.\" Although it's called agriculture in the world of food. (Laughter) This is actually called a mash-up, where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it. In the world of food we call it cooking. This is food 2.0, which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people. This is mobile food. British are very good at that. Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty, the pie, the sandwich. We invented the whole lot of them. We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food, but it's not very portable, generally. (Laughter)I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich. He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name. (Laughter)Finally, we have contextual communication. Now, the reason I show you Pernod \u2014 it's only one example. Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod. It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else. (Laughter) Unicum in Hungary, for example. The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina, which even tastes shite when you're in Greece. (Laughter)But so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people, for giving them better information \u2014 B.J. Fogg, at the University of Stanford, makes the point that actually the mobile phone is \u2014 He's invented the phrase, \"persuasive technologies.\" He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific, contextual, timely and immediate, is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal, we simply have to ask the question, and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently. I'll give you one example. If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home, and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you, put 50 dollars into your pension, you would save a lot more. The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior. Okay?Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying. Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving. If you did this, more people would save more. It's simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions, and the very nature of the decisions changes. Obviously, I don't want people to do this, because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed. (Laughter) But if anybody did want to do that, that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually: fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.Now, I've got an example here from Canada. There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada called Hunter Somerville, who was working in improv in Toronto, and got a part-time job in advertising, and was given the job of advertising Shreddies. Now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible, added value, without changing the product in the slightest. Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal, only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain. It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown. (Laughter) In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies, he came up with this.Video: (Buzzer) Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square. (Laughter)Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out? (Laughter)Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal. Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape. (Applause)Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example of intangible value creation. All it requires is photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing. I would say it's a work of genius. But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product, which is something very exciting for them. So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies. (Laughter) So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that, when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there. (Laughter)Woman: Weren't they square?Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.Man: They \u2014 Yeah, it's all in the appearance. But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six, if you flip it over it looks like a nine. But a six is very different from a nine.Woman # 3: Or an \"M\" and a \"W\". Man: An \"M\" and a \"W\", exactly.Man #2: [unclear] You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that it's more interesting looking.Man: Just try both of them. Take a square one there, first. (Laughter) Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.Man: The first one? (Laughter)Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged. There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly, who actually resented this intrusion. So, eventually, the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack. (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter)If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called the American Institute of Wine Economics, which actually does extensive research into perception of things, and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people, there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine, except when you tell the people how expensive it is, in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more. So drink your wine blind in the future.But this is both hysterically funny \u2014 but I think an important philosophical point, which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value. We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists, and less time agonizing over what else we can do.Two quotations to more or less end with. One of them is, \"Poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new.\" Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is, to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing. There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that. Because they help people share news. They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities. So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display, and increase the kind of third-party enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session, which is, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,\" which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true. And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health, love, sex and other things, and learn to place a material value on what you've previously discounted for being merely intangible, a thing not seen, you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause)", "id": 658, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nThis is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nthat pays all the bills.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nIt's held every two years in Burma.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd I particularly remember a really good speech\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nby Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nBut, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthat what we create in advertising,\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwhich is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nyou might call it badge value, subjective value,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nintangible value of some kind --\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\ngets rather a bad rap.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nIf you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwhere there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nYou can either live in a world which is poorer,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nwhich people in general don't like.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nOr you can live in a world where actually intangible value\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nconstitutes a greater part of overall value,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthat actually intangible value, in many ways\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis a very, very fine substitute\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nfor using up labor or limited resources\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nin the creation of things.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nHere is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThe question was given to a bunch of engineers,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nabout 15 years ago, \"How do we make the journey to Paris better?\"\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd they came up with a very good engineering solution,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich was to spend six billion pounds\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbuilding completely new tracks\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nfrom London to the coast,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nNow, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\n... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nmerely to make it shorter.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow what is the hedonic opportunity cost\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\non spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nHere is my naive advertising man's suggestion.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nWhat you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand female supermodels,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\npay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nfor the entire duration of the journey.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nNow, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nNow, here is another naive advertising man's question again.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd this shows that engineers,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nmedical people, scientific people,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nhave an obsession with solving the problems of reality,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nwhen actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nin society, most problems are actually problems of perception.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo I'll ask you another question.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWhat on earth is wrong with placebos?\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThey seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nThey work extraordinarily well.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThey have no side effects,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nor if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nSo I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nby Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSomeone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand actually produce placebo education.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIt actually works by giving you the impression\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthat you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nof unwarranted self-confidence,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhich then makes you very, very successful in later life.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nSo, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBut, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nHow many problems of life can be solved\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nactually by tinkering with perception,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nrather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nof actually trying to change reality?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHere's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nbut doing a bit of historical research,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nit seems to be Fredrick the Great.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nFredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nbecause he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd you get a far lower risk of famine,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nbecause you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThe only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nrather like contemporary Scottish people.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo, actually, he tried making it compulsory.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe Prussian peasantry said,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\n\"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThey are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nThere are even records of people being executed\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nfor refusing to grow potatoes.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nSo he tried plan B.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nHe tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd he planted it in a royal potato patch,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwith guards who had instructions\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nto guard over it, night and day,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbut with secret instructions not to guard it very well.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nNow, 18th century peasants know that there is one\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\npretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nit's worth stealing.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBefore long, there was a massive underground\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\npotato-growing operation in Germany.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nWhat he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIt was an absolute masterpiece.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n\"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAtaturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwas very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nin Turkey, to modernize it.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBut that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand a hell of a lot of resistance.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAtaturk was a lateral thinker.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nHe made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThere is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAll convicted child molesters\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nhave to drive a Porsche Cayenne.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhat Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWhich is that, actually, first one,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nall value is actually relative.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAll value is perceived value.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nFor those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for \"orange juice.\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nBecause actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\ndecided to practice price discrimination\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAs an advertising man, I have to admire that.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut the first thing is that all value is subjective.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSecond point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThese funny signs that flash your speed at you,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nsome of the new ones, on the bottom right,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nnow actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nto act as an emotional trigger.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nWhat's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nof the running cost of a conventional speed camera,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbut they prevent twice as many accidents.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo, the bizarre thing, which is baffling\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto conventional, classically trained economists,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nis that a weird little smiley face\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nhas a better effect on changing your behavior\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthan the threat of a \u00a360 fine and three penalty points.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTiny little behavioral economics detail:\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nin Italy, penalty points go backwards.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYou start with 12 and they take them away.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBecause they found that loss aversion\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nis a more powerful influence on people's behavior.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn Britain we tend to feel, \"Whoa!

This actually\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nhad symbolic value, badge value.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIt said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo, the modern equivalent would of course be this.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwhere the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthere are opposite kind of things\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nwhere actually the value in them depends on them being\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIf you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAdam Smith talks about 18th century America,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwhere the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nit was almost a block in the economy in New England,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nbecause even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwithout incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIt's perfectly possible to create these social pressures\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhich lead to more egalitarian societies.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nWhat's also interesting, if you look at products\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nthat have a high component\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nof what you might call messaging value,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\na high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey are often quite egalitarian.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIn terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwhich replaces material value with symbolic value.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nCoca-Cola.

It's a fake version.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt patently veers toward propaganda.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nHowever, what we do have now\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis a much more variegated media ecosystem\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nin which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nWhen I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nas translated into food.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou had a monopoly supplier.

Fogg,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nat the University of Stanford, makes the point\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthat actually the mobile phone is --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nHe's invented the phrase, \"persuasive technologies.\"\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nHe believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\ncontextual, timely and immediate,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nNow, if we have all these tools at our disposal,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwe simply have to ask the question,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nI'll give you one example.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIf you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nput 50 dollars into your pension,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nyou would save a lot more.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThe reason is that the interface fundamentally determines\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthe behavior. Okay?\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nNow, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nopportunities for impulse buying.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nYet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIf you did this, more people would save more.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's simply a question of changing the interface\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nby which people make decisions,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand the very nature of the decisions changes.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nObviously, I don't want people to do this,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbecause as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nconsumerism needlessly postponed.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut if anybody did want to do that,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nfundamental opportunities to change human behavior.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nNow, I've got an example here from Canada.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nThere was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ncalled Hunter Somerville,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nwho was working in improv in Toronto,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand got a part-time job in advertising,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand was given the job of advertising Shreddies.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nNow this is the most perfect case of creating\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nintangible, added value,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwithout changing the product in the slightest.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nShreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nonly available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nIn working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhe came up with this.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nVideo: (Buzzer)\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nMan: Shreddies is supposed to be square.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nWoman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nVoiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nSame 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nRory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nof intangible value creation. All it requires is\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nphotons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nI would say it's a work of genius.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nMan: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwhich is something very exciting for them.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nSo they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nSo I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nwhen you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nWoman: Weren't they square?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWoman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nMan: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nBut it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nif you flip it over it looks like a nine.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nBut a six is very different from a nine.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWoman # 3: Or an \"M\" and a \"W\". Man: An \"M\" and a \"W\", exactly.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nMan #2: [unclear]\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nYou just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nit's more interesting looking.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nMan: Just try both of them.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nTake a square one there, first.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nMan: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nMan: The first one?\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nRory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThere were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwho actually resented this intrusion.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo, eventually, the manufacturers actually\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\narrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nIf you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nthe American Institute of Wine Economics,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwhich actually does extensive research into perception of things,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand discovers that except for among\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nperhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthere is no correlation between quality and enjoyment\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nin wine,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nexcept when you tell the people how expensive it is,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nin which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo drink your wine blind in the future.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nBut this is both hysterically funny --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nbut I think an important philosophical point,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwhich is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWe need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand less time agonizing over what else we can do.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nTwo quotations to more or less end with.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nOne of them is, \"Poetry is when you make new things\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nfamiliar and familiar things new.\"\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWhich isn't a bad definition of what our job is,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nto help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nto gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthose things which are already existing.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThere is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nBecause they help people share news.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThey give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nand increase the kind of third-party\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nenjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThe second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nwhich is, \"We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,\"\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nwhich I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nlove, sex and other things,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand learn to place a material value\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\non what you've previously discounted\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nfor being merely intangible, a thing not seen,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nyou realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nThank you very much indeed.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A brain in a supercomputer", "duration": "890", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/henry_markram_supercomputing_the_brain_s_secrets", "transcript": "Our mission is to build a detailed, realistic computer model of the human brain. And we've done, in the past four years, a proof of concept on a small part of the rodent brain, and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up to reach the human brain.Why are we doing this? There are three important reasons. The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society, and I think that it is a key step in evolution. The second reason is, we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever, and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model. It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive. And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet that are affected by mental disorder, and the drugs that are used today are largely empirical. I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders.Now, even at this stage, we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works. And here, at TED, for the first time, I'd like to share with you how we're addressing one theory \u2014 there are many theories \u2014 one theory of how the brain works. So, this theory is that the brain creates, builds, a version of the universe, and projects this version of the universe, like a bubble, all around us.Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. But, for the first time, we can actually address this, with brain simulation, and ask very systematic and rigorous questions, whether this theory could possibly be true. The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers. It runs out of space. And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble, and we make a decision. We make a decision it's that big, even though it's not that big.And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive. Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think, you cannot feel. And you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep, or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain, but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way. What they do is they introduce a noise into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other. They are confused, and you cannot make a decision. So, while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone. He's at home having tea. (Laughter)So, when you walk up to a door and you open it, what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions, thousands of decisions about the size of the room, the walls, the height, the objects in this room. 99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. It is what you infer about that room. So I can say, with some certainty, \"I think, therefore I am.\" But I cannot say, \"You think, therefore you are,\" because \"you\" are within my perceptual bubble.Now, we can speculate and philosophize this, but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years. We can ask a very concrete question. \"Can the brain build such a perception?\" Is it capable of doing it? Does it have the substance to do it? And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain. It had to improve it a little bit. It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts, because they had to cope on land. But the real big step was the neocortex. It's a new brain. You needed it. The mammals needed it because they had to cope with parenthood, social interactions, complex cognitive functions.So, you can think of the neocortex actually as the ultimate solution today, of the universe as we know it. It's the pinnacle, it's the final product that the universe has produced. It was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons, to produce this almost frightening organ, structure. And it has not stopped its evolutionary path. In fact, the neocortex in the human brain is evolving at an enormous speed.If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex, you discover that it's made up of little modules, G5 processors, like in a computer. But there are about a million of them. They were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull. And the brain started to fold in on itself, and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted. We're just packing in columns, so that we'd have more neocortical columns to perform more complex functions.So you can think of the neocortex actually as a massive grand piano, a million-key grand piano. Each of these neocortical columns would produce a note. You stimulate it; it produces a symphony. But it's not just a symphony of perception. It's a symphony of your universe, your reality. Now, of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys. That's why you have to send your kids to good schools, hopefully eventually to Oxford. But it's not only education. It's also genetics. You may be born lucky, where you know how to master your neocortical column, and you can play a fantastic symphony.In fact, there is a new theory of autism called the \"intense world\" theory, which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns. They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic, and so the autists are probably capable of building and learning a symphony which is unthinkable for us. But you can also understand that if you have a disease within one of these columns, the note is going to be off. The perception, the symphony that you create is going to be corrupted, and you will have symptoms of disease.So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column \u2014 and it's not just for neuroscience; it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality, and perhaps to even also understand physical reality. So, what we did was, for the past 15 years, was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically. It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest. How many trees does it have? What shapes are the trees? How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to describe and discover all the rules of communication, the rules of connectivity, because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron. They choose very carefully who they connect with. It's also more than cataloging because you actually have to build three-dimensional digital models of them. And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons, built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across. And once you have that, you can actually begin to build the neocortical column.And here we're coiling them up. But as you do this, what you see is that the branches intersect actually in millions of locations, and at each of these intersections they can form a synapse. And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other. And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain. Now, the circuit, you could also think of as the fabric of the brain. And when you think of the fabric of the brain, the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet? You realize that this poses a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain, and especially to a theory that says that there is some reality that emerges out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet with a particular pattern.The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain is diversity. Every neuron is different. It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different. You may have many different types of trees, but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same. So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another, and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours. And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned in exactly the same way. And you may have more or less neurons. So it's very unlikely that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.So, how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other? Well, we don't have to speculate. We can look at all 10 million synapses now. We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons. We can use different neurons with different variations. We can position them in different places, orient them in different places. We can use less or more of them. And when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change. But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not. So, the fabric of the brain, even though your brain may be smaller, bigger, it may have different types of neurons, different morphologies of neurons, we actually do share the same fabric. And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species.So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do is you have to make this come alive. We make it come alive with equations, a lot of mathematics. And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates. So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive. We also have the mathematics to describe how neurons collect information, and how they create a little lightning bolt to communicate with each other. And when they get to the synapse, what they do is they effectively, literally, shock the synapse. It's like electrical shock that releases the chemicals from these synapses.And we've got the mathematics to describe this process. So we can describe the communication between the neurons. There literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex. But what you do need is a very big computer. And in fact you need one laptop to do all the calculations just for one neuron. So you need 10,000 laptops. So where do you go? You go to IBM, and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator. So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer. We can load up all the neurons, each one on to its processor, and fire it up, and see what happens. Take the magic carpet for a ride.Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation. It's the first view. Now, when you look at that the first time, you think, \"My god. How is reality coming out of that?\" But, in fact, you can start, even though we haven't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality. But we can ask, \"Where is the rose?\" We can ask, \"Where is it inside, if we stimulate it with a picture?\" Where is it inside the neocortex? Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.So, the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses, and look just at the raw electrical activity. Because that is what it's creating. It's creating electrical patterns. So when we did this, we indeed, for the first time, saw these ghost-like structures: electrical objects appearing within the neocortical column. And it's these electrical objects that are holding all the information about whatever stimulated it. And then when we zoomed into this, it's like a veritable universe.So the next step is just to take these brain coordinates and to project them into perceptual space. And if you do that, you will be able to step inside the reality that is created by this machine, by this piece of the brain. So, in summary, I think that the universe may have \u2014 it's possible \u2014 evolved a brain to see itself, which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself. There is a lot more to do to test these theories, and to test any other theories. But I hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain. We can do it within 10 years, and if we do succeed, we will send to TED, in 10 years, a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

It's like an archive.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nAnd the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthat are affected by mental disorder,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nand the drugs that are used today\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nare largely empirical.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nI think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nhow to treat disorders.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nNow, even at this stage,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwe can use the brain model\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto explore some fundamental questions\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nabout how the brain works.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd here, at TED, for the first time,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI'd like to share with you how we're addressing\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\none theory -- there are many theories --\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\none theory of how the brain works.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo, this theory is that the brain\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:53.958\ncreates, builds, a version of the universe,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand projects this version of the universe,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nlike a bubble, all around us.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNow, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nBut, for the first time, we can actually address this,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwith brain simulation,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand ask very systematic and rigorous questions,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nwhether this theory could possibly be true.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThe reason why the moon is huge on the horizon\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nis simply because our perceptual bubble\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\ndoes not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nIt runs out of space.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nAnd so what we do is we compare the buildings\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwithin our perceptual bubble,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand we make a decision.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nWe make a decision it's that big,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\neven though it's not that big.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd what that illustrates\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nis that decisions are the key things\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nWithout decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nyou cannot feel.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd you may think that anesthetics work\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nby sending you into some deep sleep,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nor by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nbut in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nWhat they do is they introduce a noise\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\ninto the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey are confused,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nand you cannot make a decision.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo, while you're trying to make up your mind\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhat the doctor, the surgeon, is doing\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhile he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nHe's at home having tea.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo, when you walk up to a door and you open it,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhat you compulsively have to do to perceive\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nis to make decisions,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthousands of decisions about the size of the room,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthe walls, the height, the objects in this room.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\n99 percent of what you see\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nis not what comes in through the eyes.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt is what you infer about that room.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo I can say, with some certainty,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"I think, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut I cannot say, \"You think, therefore you are,\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nbecause \"you\" are within my perceptual bubble.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nNow, we can speculate and philosophize this,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nbut we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nWe can ask a very concrete question.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\n\"Can the brain build such a perception?\"\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIs it capable of doing it?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nDoes it have the substance to do it?\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd that's what I'm going to describe to you today.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt had to improve it a little bit.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nIt had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nbecause they had to cope on land.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nBut the real big step was the neocortex.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIt's a new brain. You needed it.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThe mammals needed it\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nbecause they had to cope with parenthood,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsocial interactions,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\ncomplex cognitive functions.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo, you can think of the neocortex\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nactually as the ultimate solution today,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nof the universe as we know it.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nIt's the pinnacle, it's the final product\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat the universe has produced.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIt was so successful in evolution\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat from mouse to man it expanded\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nabout a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto produce this almost frightening\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\norgan, structure.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd it has not stopped its evolutionary path.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIn fact, the neocortex in the human brain\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nis evolving at an enormous speed.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nIf you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nyou discover that it's made up of little modules,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nG5 processors, like in a computer.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut there are about a million of them.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThey were so successful in evolution\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat what we did was to duplicate them\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nover and over and add more and more of them to the brain\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nuntil we ran out of space in the skull.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd the brain started to fold in on itself,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nWe're just packing in columns,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nso that we'd have more neocortical columns\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nto perform more complex functions.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo you can think of the neocortex actually as\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\na massive grand piano,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\na million-key grand piano.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nEach of these neocortical columns\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwould produce a note.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nYou stimulate it; it produces a symphony.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nBut it's not just a symphony of perception.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIt's a symphony of your universe, your reality.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nNow, of course it takes years to learn how\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nto master a grand piano with a million keys.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nThat's why you have to send your kids to good schools,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhopefully eventually to Oxford.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nBut it's not only education.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIt's also genetics.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nYou may be born lucky,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nwhere you know how to master your neocortical column,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand you can play a fantastic symphony.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIn fact, there is a new theory of autism\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\ncalled the \"intense world\" theory,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nThey are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand so the autists are probably capable of\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nbuilding and learning a symphony\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nwhich is unthinkable for us.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut you can also understand\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthat if you have a disease\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwithin one of these columns,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthe note is going to be off.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe perception, the symphony that you create\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nis going to be corrupted,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nand you will have symptoms of disease.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo, the Holy Grail for neuroscience\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nis really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand it's not just for neuroscience;\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nit's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand perhaps to even also understand physical reality.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, what we did was, for the past 15 years,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwas to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nIt's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHow many trees does it have?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nWhat shapes are the trees?\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHow many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBut it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ndescribe and discover all the rules of communication,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nthe rules of connectivity,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbecause the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThey choose very carefully who they connect with.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIt's also more than cataloging\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nbecause you actually have to build three-dimensional\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\ndigital models of them.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nbuilt digital models of all the different types\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nof neurons we came across.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd once you have that, you can actually\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbegin to build the neocortical column.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd here we're coiling them up.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBut as you do this, what you see\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nis that the branches intersect\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nactually in millions of locations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand at each of these intersections\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nthey can form a synapse.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd a synapse is a chemical location\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhere they communicate with each other.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnd these synapses together\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nform the network\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nor the circuit of the brain.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nNow, the circuit, you could also think of as\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthe fabric of the brain.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd when you think of the fabric of the brain,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthe structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou realize that this poses\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\na fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand especially to a theory that says\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat there is some reality that emerges\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nout of this carpet, out of this particular carpet\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwith a particular pattern.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThe reason is because the most important design secret of the brain\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nis diversity.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nEvery neuron is different.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nYou may have many different types of trees,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nbut every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nSo there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nin exactly the same way.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nAnd you may have more or less neurons.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo it's very unlikely\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo, how could we possibly create a reality\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat we can even understand each other?\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nWell, we don't have to speculate.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nWe can look at all 10 million synapses now.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWe can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nWe can use different neurons with different variations.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWe can position them in different places,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\norient them in different places.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWe can use less or more of them.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd when we do that\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwhat we discovered is that the circuitry does change.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBut the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo, the fabric of the brain,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\neven though your brain may be smaller, bigger,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nit may have different types of neurons,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\ndifferent morphologies of neurons,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwe actually do share\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthe same fabric.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd we think this is species-specific,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nwhich means that that could explain\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nwhy we can't communicate across species.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nSo, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nis you have to make this come alive.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe make it come alive\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwith equations, a lot of mathematics.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nAnd, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nwere discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe also have the mathematics to describe\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nhow neurons collect information,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand how they create a little lightning bolt\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nto communicate with each other.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd when they get to the synapse,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nwhat they do is they effectively,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nliterally, shock the synapse.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's like electrical shock\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthat releases the chemicals from these synapses.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd we've got the mathematics to describe this process.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo we can describe the communication between the neurons.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThere literally are only a handful\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nof equations that you need to simulate\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthe activity of the neocortex.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nBut what you do need is a very big computer.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd in fact you need one laptop\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nto do all the calculations just for one neuron.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nSo you need 10,000 laptops.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo where do you go? You go to IBM,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nWe can load up all the neurons,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\neach one on to its processor,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand fire it up, and see what happens.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nTake the magic carpet for a ride.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nHere we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nof what is happening in your brain\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwhen there is a stimulation.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt's the first view.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nNow, when you look at that the first time, you think,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n\"My god. How is reality coming out of that?\"\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nBut, in fact, you can start,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\neven though we haven't trained this neocortical column\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nto create a specific reality.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nBut we can ask, \"Where is the rose?\"\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe can ask, \"Where is it inside,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nif we stimulate it with a picture?\"\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nWhere is it inside the neocortex?\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nUltimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nSo, the way that we can look at that\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nis to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nand look just at the raw electrical activity.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause that is what it's creating.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nIt's creating electrical patterns.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo when we did this,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwe indeed, for the first time,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nsaw these ghost-like structures:\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nelectrical objects appearing\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwithin the neocortical column.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it's these electrical objects\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthat are holding all the information about\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nwhatever stimulated it.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd then when we zoomed into this,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nit's like a veritable universe.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nSo the next step\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nis just to take these brain coordinates\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand to project them into perceptual space.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAnd if you do that,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nyou will be able to step inside\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthe reality that is created\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nby this machine,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nby this piece of the brain.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, in summary,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI think that the universe may have --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nit's possible --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nevolved a brain to see itself,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwhich may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThere is a lot more to do to test these theories,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand to test any other theories.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBut I hope that you are at least partly convinced\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nthat it is not impossible to build a brain.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe can do it within 10 years,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand if we do succeed,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwe will send to TED, in 10 years,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\na hologram to talk to you.

Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental; much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise) We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this, pretending it doesn't exist. This habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious.There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time, and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today. The first is physiological.(Alarm clocks ring)Sorry about that. I just gave you a shot of cortisol, your fight-flight hormone. Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time, but also your breathing, heart rate \u2014 which I just also did \u2014 and your brainwaves.It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it. This is surf. (Ocean waves) It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute. Most people find that very soothing, and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human, so there is a deep resonance with being at rest. We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday.The second way in which sound affects you is psychological. Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio) This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on. Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.Natural sound can do that, too. Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring. There's a reason: over hundreds of thousands of years we've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe. It's when they stop you need to be worried.The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively. You can't understand two people talking at once (Voice-over) or in this case, one person talking twice. You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input, which is why noise like this ...(Office noise)is extremely damaging for productivity. If you have to work in an open-plan office like this, your productivity is greatly reduced. And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]You are one-third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms. I have a tip for you: if you work in spaces like that, carry headphones with you, with a soothing sound like birdsong. Put them on, and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally. With all that other stuff going on, it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.(Techno music)So ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour? I don't think so. At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds. So if I were to play this ...(Jackhammer)for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable; for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves. For people who can't get away from noise like that, it's extremely damaging for their health.And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages. Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, even hostile, and it has a dramatic effect on sales. For you retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.[Inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down 28%]They're losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster, or just turning around at the door. We've all done it, left the area, because the sound in there is so dreadful.I want to spend just a moment talking about the model we've developed, which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound, analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I just talked about. Or start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want, and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect. At last we've got some science we can apply. And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed. It's powerful for two reasons: you recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully. I'll give you two examples.(First chord of \"A Hard Day's Night\")Most of you recognize that immediately. The younger, maybe not.(Laughter)(First notes of \"Jaws\" theme)Most of you associate that with something! Now, those are one-second samples of music. Music is very powerful, and unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately. I hope that's going to change over the next few years.Let me talk about brands for a moment, since some of you run brands. Every brand is out there making sound right now. There are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important. And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center. I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.(Intel ad jingle)You all recognize that one.(Nokia ringtone)This is the most-played tune in the world today \u2014 1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.(Laughter)And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.I'll leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses, for commercial sound. First, make it congruent, pointing in the same direction as your visual communication. That increases impact by over 1,100 percent. If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent, you reduce impact by 86 percent. That's an order of magnitude, up or down. This is important. Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation. Thirdly, make it valuable. Give people something with the sound, don't just bombard them with stuff. Finally, test and test it again. Sound is complex; there are many countervailing influences. It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti: sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness. If you're listening consciously, you can take control of the sound around you. It's good for your health and for your productivity. If we all do that, we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world. I'll leave you with more birdsong.

sound is pointing\nthe opposite direction, incongruent,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.934\nyou reduce impact by 86 percent.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.644\nThat's an order of magnitude, up or down.\n\n00:04:56.668 --> 00:04:58.152\nThis is important.\n\n00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.934\nSecondly, make it appropriate\nto the situation.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.215\nThirdly, make it

again.\n\n00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:10.098\nSound is complex; there are many\ncountervailing influences.\n\n00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:12.099\nIt can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:\n\n00:05:12.123 -->

"https://www.ted.com/talks/john_gerzema_the_post_crisis_consumer", "transcript": "Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth has evaporated over the course of the last two years. We've questioned the future of capitalism. We've questioned the financial industry. We've looked at our government oversight. We've questioned where we're going. And yet, at the same time, this very well may be a seminal moment in American history, an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in America.I'm calling this The Great Unwind.(Laughter)And the idea is a simple, simple idea, which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action. Consumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America have actually started, just like banks and just like businesses, to de-leverage, to unwind their leverage in daily life, to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as they move forward.So, to understand this \u2014 and I'm going to stress this \u2014 it's not about the consumer being in retreat. The consumer is empowered. To understand this, we'll step back and look at what's happened over the last year and a half. So if you've been gone, this is the CliffsNotes on what's happened in the economy.(Laughter)Unemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down. Commodity prices are like this.If you're a mom trying to manage a budget, and oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer, and it's somewhere between 50 and 70, do you plan vacations? How do you buy? What's your strategy in your household? Will the bailout work? We have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care \u2014 all these issues facing us. You put them all together, mix them up in a bouillabaisse, and you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb.In fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis, because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives, actually contributed a large part to the problem. This is something I call the 50-20 paradox. It took us 50 years to reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent. Fifty years. Do you know what this was right here? This was World War II. Do you know why savings was so high? There was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.What happened, though, over the course of the last 20 years, we went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate. Because we binged. We bought extra-large cars, supersized everything, we bought remedies for restless leg syndrome. All these things together basically created a factor where the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today. The personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent in the span of about 15 years. So consumers got over-leveraged. And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.This is an absolutely staggering chart. It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009. And what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education, future children in our households.So if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout, what you can see is, if you stack up dollar bills, first of all, 360,000 dollars is about the size of a five-foot-four guy. But if you stack it up, you see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out. So this is the first 315 billion. But I read this fact the other day, that one trillion seconds equals 32,000 years. So if you think about that, the context, the casualness with which we talk about trillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there, we are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.However, consumers have moved. They are taking responsibility. What we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate. In fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis. We're working our way back up to that 10 percent. Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter, spending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years \u2014 almost a 3.7 percent decline.Visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than credit cards. So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have. And we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest. But that's not really the whole story, because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation. And you've got to admit, over the last year and a half, consumers have been doing some weird things. It's pretty staggering, what we've lived through. If you take into account that 80 percent of all Americans were born after World War II, this was essentially our Depression.And so, as a result, some crazy things have happened. I'll give you some examples. Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.(Laughter)Dentists report molars \u2014 people grinding their teeth, coming in and reporting that they've had stress. So there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced. Gun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks, are up almost 25 percent since January. Vasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell Institute. And lastly, but a very good point, hopefully not related to the former point I just made, which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003. Does anybody know why?(Laughter)No one's at the beach. So there's a bright side to everything.But seriously, what we see happening, and the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat, is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out. What I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption. Right?(Applause)If you think about the last three decades, the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s, to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade. But the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate. By restricting their demand, consumers can actually align their values with their spending, and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more, but to be about better.We're going to explain that right now. Based on Y&R's BrandAsset Valuator, proprietary tool of VML and Young & Rubicam, we set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis with the consumer marketplace. We found a couple of really interesting things. We're going to go through four value shifts that we see driving new consumer behaviors, that offer new management principles.The first cultural value shift we see is this tendency toward something we call \"liquid life.\" This is the movement from Americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity, because the less excess that you have around you, the more nimble and fleet of foot you are. As a result, d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is in. D\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti-fashion. The management principle is dollars and cents.So let's look at some examples of this d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption that falls out of this value. The first thing is, something must be happening when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.(Laughter)But seriously, we also have this phenomenon on Madison Avenue and in other places, where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary, generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases. We see high-end haggling in fashion today, high-end haggling for luxury and real estate. We also see just a relaxing of ego, and sort of a dismantling of artifice.This is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar. Blue-collar yacht club \u2014 where you can join, but you've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership. We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key: agritourism \u2014 going to vineyards and going to farms.And then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents. What businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting. A couple things that are kind of cool. One is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer. They found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month, less at the end of the month. So they started to change their packaging: larger packs at the beginning of the month, smaller packaging at the end of the month.Really interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants. They've just instituted dynamic pricing. It takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups, to the weather, to the team records, in setting prices for the consumer. Another quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga. Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire to not want to be locked in to fixed cost. Again, this theme is about variable cost, variable living. So micro-payments have become huge. And lastly, some people are using Hulu as a device to get rid of their cable bill. So, really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of and that marketers are starting to understand.The second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play. We see that play itself out with empathy and respect. The consumer is demanding it. And, as a result, businesses must provide not only value, but values. Increasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company, at their conduct in the marketplace. So we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession. I'll give you a few examples.One is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods, and increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system. Also, a wonderful by-product of a really lousy thing, which has been unemployment, is a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country. We also see the phenomenon \u2014 some of you may have \"boomerang kids\" \u2014 these are \"boomerang alumni,\" where universities are actually reconnecting with alumni and helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining. We also talked about character and professionalism. We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January, and suddenly Sully has become a key name on BabyCenter.(Laughter)So, from a value and values standpoint, what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways. Microsoft is doing something wonderful. They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training, using their existing infrastructure to do something good.Also, a really interesting company is GORE-TEX. GORE-TEX is all about personal accountability of their management and their employees, to the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses. But they also talk about the fact that their executives \u2014 all of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet for everyone to see. Complete transparency. Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.(Laughter)The third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism is about durable living. We're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon, not a sprint. They're digging in and looking for ways to extract value out of every purchase they make. Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before: 9.4 years on average, in March. A record. We also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America. Did you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card? The highest percentage ever in our nation's history.So what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge. Continuing education is up. Everything is focused on betterment, training, development and moving forward. We also see a big DIY movement. I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America are actually built by owners. That includes cottages and the like, but 30 percent. People are getting their hands dirty, rolling up their sleeves. They want these skills.We see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens, chickens and ducks. And when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work, but the principle is there; it's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself. Then we look at the High Line in New York City, an excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure for something good, which is a brand-new park in New York City.So what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers, be a brand that lasts, offer transparency, promise you're going to be there beyond today's sale. Perfect example of that is Patagonia. Patagonia's \"Footprint Chronicles\" basically goes through and tracks every product they make, and gives you social responsibility, and helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make.Another great example is Fidelity. Rather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases, this is about 529 rewards for your student education. Or the interesting company Sunrun. I love this company. They've created a consumer collective where they put solar panels on households and create a consumer-based utility, where the electricity they generate is basically pumped back out into the marketplace. So it's a consumer-driven co-op.The fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see is this movement about \"return to the fold.\" It's incredibly important right now. Trust is not parceled out, as we all know. It's now about connecting to your communities, connecting to your social networks. In my book, I talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company, versus 15 percent on advertising. So in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off. This is about consumers working together to get what they want out of the marketplace. Let's look at a couple of quick examples.The artisanal movement is huge: everything about locally derived products and services, supporting your local neighborhoods, whether it's cheeses, wines and other products. Also this rise of local currencies. Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment, you're doing business with people you trust in your local markets. So this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon. And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating. They actually started, in certain communities in the United States, to publish people's electricity usage. And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling, which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms, that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled. And then there's this other really interesting movement in California, which is about carrot mobs. The traditional thing would be to boycott, right? Have a stick. Well, why not have a carrot? So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good.And then we look at what companies can do. This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer. You have to realize that you can't fight and control this. You actually need to organize it. You need to harness it. You need to give it meaning. And there's lots of really interesting examples here. First is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of and diversified from rating restaurants, into actually rating health care. So what credentials does Zagat's have? Well, they have a lot, because it's their network of people. So that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic.Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi. This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck. It's a moving truck through L.A., and the only way you can find it is through Twitter.(Laughter)Or you look at Johnson & Johnson's \"Momversations,\" a phenomenal blog that's been built up, where J&J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers, allowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect. And it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well. This, plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs, from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter, creating an open environment, allowing their employees to be part of the process, rather than hidden behind walls.You see this rising force in total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it. So when we look at this and step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real. It's been tremendously powerful for consumers. But at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity. The Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin. Crisis equals opportunity. What we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession.So we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better: it will drive innovation; it will make longer-lasting products; it will create better, more intuitive customer service; and it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share. So when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data, we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 661, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.934\nThirteen trillion dollars in wealth\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.934\nhas evaporated over the course\nof the last two years.\n\n00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.808\nWe've questioned the future of capitalism.\n\n00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:23.184\nWe've questioned the financial industry.\n\n00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:25.184\nWe've looked at our government oversight.\n\n00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:26.902\nWe've questioned where we're going.\n\n00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:28.235\nAnd yet, at the same time,\n\n00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.135\nthis very well may be\na seminal moment in American history,\n\n00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.484\nan opportunity for the consumer\nto actually take control and guide us\n\n00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.684\nto a new trajectory in America.\n\n00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.433\nI'm calling this The Great Unwind.\n\n00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:40.459\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.084\nAnd the idea is a simple, simple idea,\n\n00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:47.188\nwhich is the fact that the consumer\nhas moved from a state of anxiety\n\n00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:48.370\nto action.\n\n00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:52.633\nConsumers who represent 72 percent\nof the GDP of America\n\n00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:56.101\nhave actually started, just like banks\nand just like businesses,\n\n00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.209\nto de-leverage, to unwind\ntheir leverage in daily life,\n\n00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:03.184\nto remove themselves\nfrom the liability and risk\n\n00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.084\nthat presents itself as they move forward.\n\n00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.841\nSo, to understand this --\nand I'm going to stress this --\n\n00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:11.028\nit's not about the consumer\nbeing in retreat.\n\n00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:12.412\nThe consumer is empowered.\n\n00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:15.693\nTo understand this, we'll step back\nand look at what's happened\n\n00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:17.612\nover the last year and a half.\n\n00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:19.855\nSo if you've been gone,\nthis is the CliffsNotes\n\n00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.503\non what's happened in the economy.\n\n00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:22.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:25.625\nUnemployment up.

--> 00:02:13.274\nDo you know why savings was so high?\n\n00:02:13.298 --> 00:02:16.608\nThere was nothing to buy,\nunless you wanted to buy some rivets.\n\n00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:19.562\nWhat happened, though,\nover the course of the last 20 years,\n\n00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:23.746\nwe went from a 10 percent savings rate\nto a negative savings rate.\n\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.423\nBecause we binged.\n\n00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:29.240\nWe bought extra-large cars,\nsupersized everything,\n\n00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:31.972\nwe bought remedies\nfor restless leg syndrome.\n\n00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:35.902\nAll these things together\nbasically created a factor\n\n00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.514\nwhere the consumer drove us\nheadlong into the crisis\n\n00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:39.811\nthat we face today.\n\n00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:46.112\nThe personal debt-to-income ratio\nbasically went from 65 to 135 percent\n\n00:02:46.136 --> 00:02:48.644\nin the span of about 15 years.\n\n00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.755\nSo consumers got over-leveraged.\n\n00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.960\nAnd of course our banks did as well,\nas did our federal government.\n\n00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:56.050\nThis is an absolutely staggering chart.\n\n00:02:56.074 --> 00:03:00.681\nIt shows leverage,\ntrended out from 1919 to 2009.\n\n00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:03.357\nAnd what you end up seeing\nis the whole phenomenon\n\n00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:07.237\nthat we are actually stepping forth\nand basically leveraging\n\n00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.440\nfuture education, future children\nin our households.\n\n00:03:10.464 --> 00:03:13.564\nSo if you look at this in the context\nof visualizing the bailout,\n\n00:03:13.588 --> 00:03:16.084\nwhat you can see is,\nif you stack up dollar bills,\n\n00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:18.350\nfirst of all, 360,000 dollars\n\n00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:20.893\nis about the size of a five-foot-four guy.\n\n00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:25.194\nBut if you stack it up, you see\nthis amazing, staggering amount of dollars\n\n00:03:25.218 --> 00:03:28.084\nthat have been put into the system\nto fund and bail us out.\n\n00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.273\nSo this is the first 315 billion.\n\n00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:32.070\nBut I read this fact the other day,\n\n00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:35.404\nthat one trillion seconds\nequals 32,000 years.\n\n00:03:35.428 --> 00:03:36.745\nSo if you think about that,\n\n00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.265\nthe context, the casualness\nwith which we talk about\n\n00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.542\ntrillion-dollar bailout here\nand trillion there,\n\n00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:44.951\nwe are stacking ourselves up\nfor long-term leverage.\n\n00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.627\nHowever, consumers have moved.\n\n00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:49.690\nThey are taking responsibility.\n\n00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:52.243\nWhat we're seeing\nis an uptake in the savings rate.\n\n00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.982\nIn fact, 11 straight months\nof savings have happened\n\n00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:56.653\nsince the beginning of the crisis.\n\n00:03:56.677 --> 00:03:59.041\nWe're working our way back up\nto that 10 percent.\n\n00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:00.995\nAlso, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,\n\n00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.400\nspending dropped\nto its lowest level in 62 years --\n\n00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:07.084\nalmost a 3.7 percent decline.\n\n00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:10.988\nVisa now reports that more people\nare using debit cards than credit cards.\n\n00:04:11.012 --> 00:04:14.405\nSo we're starting to pay for things\nwith money that we have.\n\n00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:18.084\nAnd we're starting to be much more careful\nabout how we save and invest.\n\n00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:20.084\nBut that's not really the whole story,\n\n00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:23.025\nbecause this has also been a dramatic\ntime of transformation.\n\n00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:25.675\nAnd you've got to admit,\nover the last year and a half,\n\n00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.767\nconsumers have been doing\nsome weird things.\n\n00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.082\nIt's pretty staggering,\nwhat we've lived through.\n\n00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:32.802\nIf you take into account\nthat 80 percent of all Americans\n\n00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.222\nwere born after World War II,\n\n00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.979\nthis was essentially our Depression.\n\n00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:38.808\nAnd so, as a result,\nsome crazy things have happened.\n\n00:04:38.832 --> 00:04:40.182\nI'll give you some examples.\n\n00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:44.871\nLet's talk about dentists, vasectomies,\nguns and shark attacks.\n\n00:04:44.895 --> 00:04:46.683\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:50.590\nDentists report molars --\npeople grinding their teeth,\n\n00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:52.977\ncoming in and reporting\nthat they've had stress.\n\n00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:56.423\nSo there's an increase in people\nhaving to have their fillings replaced.\n\n00:04:56.447 --> 00:04:59.741\nGun sales, according to the FBI,\nwho does background checks,\n\n00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:02.859\nare up almost 25 percent since January.\n\n00:05:02.883 --> 00:05:07.536\nVasectomies are up 48 percent,\naccording to the Cornell Institute.\n\n00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.964\nAnd lastly, but a very good point,\n\n00:05:09.988 --> 00:05:12.564\nhopefully not related\nto the former point I just made,\n\n00:05:12.588 --> 00:05:16.051\nwhich is that shark attacks\nare at their lowest level from 2003.\n\n00:05:16.075 --> 00:05:17.596\nDoes anybody know why?\n\n00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.151\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:20.343\nNo one's at the beach.\n\n00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.263\nSo there's a bright side to everything.\n\n00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:24.473\nBut seriously, what we see happening,\n\n00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:27.758\nand the reason I want to stress\nthat the consumer is not in retreat,\n\n00:05:27.782 --> 00:05:29.797\nis that this is a tremendous opportunity\n\n00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.415\nfor the consumer who drove us\ninto this recession\n\n00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.964\nto lead us right back out.\n\n00:05:33.988 --> 00:05:37.330\nWhat I mean by that is we can\nmove from mindless consumption\n\n00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:39.382\nto mindful consumption.\n\n00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:40.566\nRight?\n\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.665\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.721\nIf you think about the last three decades,\n\n00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:47.027\nthe consumer has moved\nfrom savvy about marketing in the '90s,\n\n00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:51.028\nto gathering all these amazing social\nand search tools in this decade.\n\n00:05:51.052 --> 00:05:54.381\nBut the one thing holding them back\nis the ability to discriminate.\n\n00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:55.742\nBy restricting their demand,\n\n00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:59.084\nconsumers can actually align\ntheir values with their spending,\n\n00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.688\nand drive capitalism and business\nto not just be about more,\n\n00:06:02.712 --> 00:06:03.878\nbut to be about better.\n\n00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:05.879\nWe're going to explain that right now.\n\n00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:08.684\nBased on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,\n\n00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:11.409\nproprietary tool of VML\nand Young &amp; Rubicam,\n\n00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.317\nwe set out to understand\nwhat's been happening in the crisis\n\n00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:15.882\nwith the consumer marketplace.\n\n00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:18.123\nWe found a couple\nof really interesting things.\n\n00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:20.574\nWe're going to go\nthrough four value shifts\n\n00:06:20.598 --> 00:06:22.934\nthat we see driving\nnew consumer behaviors,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.015\nthat offer new management principles.\n\n00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.849\nThe first cultural value shift we see\n\n00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:29.499\nis this tendency toward something\nwe call \"liquid life.\"\n\n00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.673\nThis is the movement\n\n00:06:30.697 --> 00:06:33.778\nfrom Americans defining\ntheir success on having things\n\n00:06:33.802 --> 00:06:35.084\nto having liquidity,\n\n00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:37.800\nbecause the less excess\nthat you have around you,\n\n00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:39.976\nthe more nimble and fleet of foot you are.\n\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.470\nAs a result, d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is in.\n\n00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:46.429\nD\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption is the whole idea\nthat spending money frivolously\n\n00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.191\nmakes you look a little bit anti-fashion.\n\n00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:51.704\nThe management principle\nis dollars and cents.\n\n00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:54.572\nSo let's look at some examples\nof this d\u00e9class\u00e9 consumption\n\n00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.024\nthat falls out of this value.\n\n00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:58.345\nThe first thing is,\nsomething must be happening\n\n00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:00.445\nwhen P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.\n\n00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:01.483\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:01.507 --> 00:07:03.849\nBut seriously, we also have\nthis phenomenon\n\n00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:05.798\non Madison Avenue and in other places,\n\n00:07:05.822 --> 00:07:08.745\nwhere people are actually\nwalking out of luxury boutiques\n\n00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.582\nwith ordinary, generic paper bags\nto hide the brand purchases.\n\n00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:15.583\nWe see high-end haggling in fashion today,\n\n00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:18.084\nhigh-end haggling\nfor luxury and real estate.\n\n00:07:18.108 --> 00:07:20.480\nWe also see just a relaxing of ego,\n\n00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:22.756\nand sort of a dismantling of artifice.\n\n00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.627\nThis is a story on the yacht club\nthat's all basically blue collar.\n\n00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:28.825\nBlue-collar yacht club --\nwhere you can join,\n\n00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.084\nbut you've got to work in the boatyard\nas condition of membership.\n\n00:07:32.108 --> 00:07:36.769\nWe also see the trend toward tourism\nthat's a little bit more low-key:\n\n00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:39.920\nagritourism -- going to vineyards\nand going to farms.\n\n00:07:39.944 --> 00:07:43.569\nAnd then we also see this movement\nforward from dollars and cents.\n\n00:07:43.593 --> 00:07:46.308\nWhat businesses can do to connect\nwith these new mindsets\n\n00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:47.499\nis really interesting.\n\n00:07:47.523 --> 00:07:49.368\nA couple things that are kind of cool.\n\n00:07:49.392 --> 00:07:53.085\nOne is that Frito-Lay figured out\nthis liquidity thing with their consumer.\n\n00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:56.512\nThey found their consumer had more\nmoney at the beginning of the month,\n\n00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.945\nless at the end of the month.\n\n00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:59.982\nSo they started to change their packaging:\n\n00:08:00.006 --> 00:08:02.028\nlarger packs at the beginning\nof the month,\n\n00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:04.072\nsmaller packaging at the end of the month.\n\n00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:06.815\nReally interestingly, too,\nwas the San Francisco Giants.\n\n00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.084\nThey've just instituted dynamic pricing.\n\n00:08:09.108 --> 00:08:12.327\nIt takes into account everything\nfrom the pitcher match-ups,\n\n00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:14.194\nto the weather, to the team records,\n\n00:08:14.218 --> 00:08:16.622\nin setting prices for the consumer.\n\n00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:21.677\nAnother quick example of these types\nof movements is the rise of Zynga.\n\n00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.981\nZynga has risen on the consumer's desire\n\n00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.017\nto not want to be locked in to fixed cost.\n\n00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.801\nAgain, this theme is about variable\ncost, variable living.\n\n00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.697\nSo micro-payments have become huge.\n\n00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:33.300\nAnd lastly, some people are using Hulu\n\n00:08:33.324 --> 00:08:35.396\nas a device to get rid\nof their cable bill.\n\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.010\nSo, really clever ideas there\nthat are being taken ahold of\n\n00:08:39.034 --> 00:08:41.205\nand that marketers\nare starting to understand.\n\n00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.859\nThe second of the four values\nis this movement toward\n\n00:08:43.883 --> 00:08:45.188\nethics and fair play.\n\n00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:48.349\nWe see that play itself out\nwith empathy and respect.\n\n00:08:48.373 --> 00:08:49.994\nThe consumer is demanding it.\n\n00:08:50.018 --> 00:08:53.184\nAnd, as a result, businesses\nmust provide not only value,\n\n00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:54.360\nbut values.\n\n00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:57.557\nIncreasingly, consumers are looking\nat the culture of the company,\n\n00:08:57.581 --> 00:08:59.326\nat their conduct in the marketplace.\n\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.018\nSo we see with empathy and respect\n\n00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:03.838\nlots of really hopeful things\ncome out of this recession.\n\n00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:05.253\nI'll give you a few examples.\n\n00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:07.802\nOne is the rise toward communities\nand neighborhoods,\n\n00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:11.540\nand increased emphasis on your neighbors\nas your support system.\n\n00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:15.611\nAlso, a wonderful by-product\nof a really lousy thing,\n\n00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:17.003\nwhich has been unemployment,\n\n00:09:17.027 --> 00:09:19.828\nis a rise in volunteerism\nthat's been noted in our country.\n\n00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:23.522\nWe also see the phenomenon --\nsome of you may have \"boomerang kids\" --\n\n00:09:23.546 --> 00:09:25.183\nthese are \"boomerang alumni,\"\n\n00:09:25.207 --> 00:09:27.940\nwhere universities are actually\nreconnecting with alumni\n\n00:09:27.964 --> 00:09:30.745\nand helping them with jobs,\nsharing skills and retraining.\n\n00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.317\nWe also talked about character\nand professionalism.\n\n00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:37.084\nWe had this miracle on the Hudson\nin New York City in January,\n\n00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:41.084\nand suddenly Sully has become\na key name on BabyCenter.\n\n00:09:41.108 --> 00:09:42.178\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:44.598\nSo, from a value and values standpoint,\n\n00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:47.575\nwhat companies can do is connect\nin lots of different ways.\n\n00:09:47.599 --> 00:09:49.491\nMicrosoft is doing something wonderful.\n\n00:09:49.515 --> 00:09:53.353\nThey are actually vowing to retrain\ntwo million Americans with IT training,\n\n00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:56.479\nusing their existing infrastructure\nto do something good.\n\n00:09:56.503 --> 00:09:58.964\nAlso, a really interesting\ncompany is GORE-TEX.\n\n00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:01.698\nGORE-TEX is all about\npersonal accountability\n\n00:10:01.722 --> 00:10:03.671\nof their management and their employees,\n\n00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:07.253\nto the point where they really\nkind of shun the idea of bosses.\n\n00:10:07.277 --> 00:10:10.042\nBut they also talk about the fact\nthat their executives --\n\n00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.138\nall of their expense reports\nare put onto their company intranet\n\n00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:14.341\nfor everyone to see.\n\n00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:16.084\nComplete transparency.\n\n00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.384\nThink twice before you have\nthat bottle of wine.\n\n00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:19.465\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:22.262\nThe third of the four laws\nof post-crisis consumerism\n\n00:10:22.286 --> 00:10:23.771\nis about durable living.\n\n00:10:23.795 --> 00:10:26.332\nWe're seeing in our data\nthat consumers are realizing\n\n00:10:26.356 --> 00:10:28.084\nthis is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n00:10:28.108 --> 00:10:30.967\nThey're digging in and looking\nfor ways to extract value\n\n00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:33.084\nout of every purchase they make.\n\n00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:36.023\nWitness the fact that Americans\nare holding on to their cars\n\n00:10:36.047 --> 00:10:39.909\nlonger than ever before:\n9.4 years on average, in March.\n\n00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:41.084\nA record.\n\n00:10:41.108 --> 00:10:45.084\nWe also see the fact that libraries\nhave become a huge resource for America.\n\n00:10:45.108 --> 00:10:48.950\nDid you know that 68 percent\nof Americans now carry a library card?\n\n00:10:48.974 --> 00:10:51.439\nThe highest percentage ever\nin our nation's history.\n\n00:10:51.463 --> 00:10:55.084\nSo what you see in this trend\nis also the accumulation of knowledge.\n\n00:10:55.108 --> 00:10:56.827\nContinuing education is up.\n\n00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.489\nEverything is focused\non betterment, training,\n\n00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:01.298\ndevelopment and moving forward.\n\n00:11:01.322 --> 00:11:03.859\nWe also see a big DIY movement.\n\n00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:08.546\nI was fascinated to learn that 30 percent\nof all homes in America\n\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.084\nare actually built by owners.\n\n00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:11.966\nThat includes cottages and the like,\n\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.158\nbut 30 percent.\n\n00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:16.194\nPeople are getting their hands dirty,\nrolling up their sleeves.\n\n00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:17.385\nThey want these skills.\n\n00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:20.973\nWe see it with the phenomenon of raising\nbackyard hens, chickens and ducks.\n\n00:11:20.997 --> 00:11:23.685\nAnd when you work out the math,\nthey say it doesn't work,\n\n00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:25.009\nbut the principle is there;\n\n00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:27.748\nit's about being sustainable\nand taking care of yourself.\n\n00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:30.383\nThen we look at the High Line\nin New York City,\n\n00:11:30.407 --> 00:11:33.175\nan excellent use of reimagining\nexisting infrastructure\n\n00:11:33.199 --> 00:11:34.358\nfor something good,\n\n00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:36.417\nwhich is a brand-new park\nin New York City.\n\n00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:40.532\nSo what brands can do, and companies,\nis pay dividends to consumers,\n\n00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:42.084\nbe a brand that lasts,\n\n00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:43.497\noffer transparency,\n\n00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.015\npromise you're going to be there\nbeyond today's sale.\n\n00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.084\nPerfect example of that is Patagonia.\n\n00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:49.822\nPatagonia's \"Footprint Chronicles\"\n\n00:11:49.846 --> 00:11:53.644\nbasically goes through and tracks\nevery product they make,\n\n00:11:53.668 --> 00:11:55.458\nand gives you social responsibility,\n\n00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:59.021\nand helps you understand the ethics\nbehind the product they make.\n\n00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:00.827\nAnother great example is Fidelity.\n\n00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:04.537\nRather than instant cash-back rewards\non your credit or debit purchases,\n\n00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:09.457\nthis is about 529 rewards\nfor your student education.\n\n00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:11.568\nOr the interesting company Sunrun.\n\n00:12:11.592 --> 00:12:12.747\nI love this company.\n\n00:12:12.771 --> 00:12:14.838\nThey've created a consumer collective\n\n00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:17.208\nwhere they put solar panels on households\n\n00:12:17.232 --> 00:12:19.327\nand create a consumer-based utility,\n\n00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:21.049\nwhere the electricity they generate\n\n00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.697\nis basically pumped back out\ninto the marketplace.\n\n00:12:23.721 --> 00:12:25.457\nSo it's a consumer-driven co-op.\n\n00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:29.155\nThe fourth post-crisis\nconsumerism that we see\n\n00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:31.496\nis this movement\nabout \"return to the fold.\"\n\n00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.319\nIt's incredibly important right now.\n\n00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:35.927\nTrust is not parceled out, as we all know.\n\n00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.143\nIt's now about connecting\nto your communities,\n\n00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:39.929\nconnecting to your social networks.\n\n00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:41.667\nIn my book, I talked about the fact\n\n00:12:41.691 --> 00:12:44.366\nthat 72 percent of people trust\nwhat other people say\n\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.841\nabout a brand or a company,\n\n00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.907\nversus 15 percent on advertising.\n\n00:12:47.931 --> 00:12:51.651\nSo in that respect, cooperative\nconsumerism has really taken off.\n\n00:12:51.675 --> 00:12:54.658\nThis is about consumers working\ntogether to get what they want\n\n00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:55.858\nout of the marketplace.\n\n00:12:55.882 --> 00:12:57.859\nLet's look at a couple of quick examples.\n\n00:12:57.883 --> 00:12:59.456\nThe artisanal movement is huge:\n\n00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.537\neverything about locally\nderived products and services,\n\n00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:04.345\nsupporting your local neighborhoods,\n\n00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:07.345\nwhether it's cheeses,\nwines and other products.\n\n00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:10.027\nAlso this rise of local currencies.\n\n00:13:10.051 --> 00:13:13.026\nRealizing that it's difficult\nto get loans in this environment,\n\n00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.109\nyou're doing business\nwith people you trust\n\n00:13:15.133 --> 00:13:16.312\nin your local markets.\n\n00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:20.204\nSo this rise of local currency\nis another really interesting phenomenon.\n\n00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:23.850\nAnd then they did a recent report\nI thought was fascinating.\n\n00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:27.047\nThey actually started, in certain\ncommunities in the United States,\n\n00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:29.098\nto publish people's electricity usage.\n\n00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:32.433\nAnd what they found out is when\nthat was available for public record,\n\n00:13:32.457 --> 00:13:35.527\nthe people's electricity usage\nin those communities dropped.\n\n00:13:36.469 --> 00:13:39.084\nThen we also look\nat the idea of cow-pooling,\n\n00:13:39.108 --> 00:13:43.303\nwhich is the whole phenomenon\nof consumers organizing together\n\n00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:47.220\nto buy meat from organic farms,\nthat they know is safe and controlled\n\n00:13:47.244 --> 00:13:49.430\nin the way that they want it\nto be controlled.\n\n00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:53.021\nAnd then there's this other really\ninteresting movement in California,\n\n00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:54.528\nwhich is about carrot mobs.\n\n00:13:54.552 --> 00:13:57.598\nThe traditional thing would be\nto boycott, right? Have a stick.\n\n00:13:57.622 --> 00:13:58.968\nWell, why not have a carrot?\n\n00:13:58.992 --> 00:14:02.296\nSo these are consumers organizing,\npooling their resources\n\n00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.084\nto incentify companies to do good.\n\n00:14:05.108 --> 00:14:07.905\nAnd then we look at what companies can do.\n\n00:14:07.929 --> 00:14:11.382\nThis is all the opportunity\nabout being a community organizer.\n\n00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:14.373\nYou have to realize\nthat you can't fight and control this.\n\n00:14:14.397 --> 00:14:16.007\nYou actually need to organize it.\n\n00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:18.556\nYou need to harness it.\nYou need to give it meaning.\n\n00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.792\nAnd there's lots of really\ninteresting examples here.\n\n00:14:21.816 --> 00:14:26.609\nFirst is just the rise of the fact\nthat Zagat's has actually moved out of\n\n00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:28.861\nand diversified from rating restaurants,\n\n00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:31.084\ninto actually rating health care.\n\n00:14:31.108 --> 00:14:33.237\nSo what credentials does Zagat's have?\n\n00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:34.431\nWell, they have a lot,\n\n00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:36.299\nbecause it's their network of people.\n\n00:14:36.323 --> 00:14:38.866\nSo that becomes\na very powerful force for them\n\n00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.084\nto make their brand more elastic.\n\n00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:43.365\nThen you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.\n\n00:14:43.894 --> 00:14:46.871\nThis Kogi doesn't exist.\nIt's a moving truck.\n\n00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:48.494\nIt's a moving truck through L.A.,\n\n00:14:48.518 --> 00:14:51.014\nand the only way you can find it\nis through Twitter.\n\n00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:52.095\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.272\nOr you look at\n\n00:14:53.296 --> 00:14:58.358\nJohnson &amp; Johnson's \"Momversations,\"\na phenomenal blog that's been built up,\n\n00:14:58.382 --> 00:15:02.512\nwhere J&amp;J basically is tapping\ninto the power of mommy bloggers,\n\n00:15:02.536 --> 00:15:06.984\nallowing them to create a forum\nwhere they can communicate and connect.\n\n00:15:07.008 --> 00:15:11.847\nAnd it's also become a very valuable\nadvertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.\n\n00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.085\nThis, plus the fact that you've got\nphenomenal work from CEOs,\n\n00:15:16.109 --> 00:15:18.649\nfrom Ford to Zappos,\nconnecting on Twitter,\n\n00:15:18.673 --> 00:15:20.084\ncreating an open environment,\n\n00:15:20.108 --> 00:15:23.146\nallowing their employees\nto be part of the process,\n\n00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.878\nrather than hidden behind walls.\n\n00:15:24.902 --> 00:15:29.107\nYou see this rising force\nin total transparency and openness\n\n00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:30.919\nthat companies are starting to adopt,\n\n00:15:30.943 --> 00:15:33.250\nall because the consumer is demanding it.\n\n00:15:33.274 --> 00:15:35.220\nSo when we look at this and step back,\n\n00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:39.436\nwhat I believe is that the crisis\nthat exists today is definitely real.\n\n00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.084\nIt's been tremendously\npowerful for consumers.\n\n00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:45.671\nBut at the same time,\nthis is also a tremendous opportunity.\n\n00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:49.162\nThe Chinese character for crisis\nis actually the same side\n\n00:15:49.186 --> 00:15:50.353\nof the same coin.\n\n00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:52.084\nCrisis equals opportunity.\n\n00:15:52.108 --> 00:15:55.602\nWhat we're seeing with consumers\nright now is the ability for them\n\n00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:58.262\nto actually lead us forward\nout of this recession.\n\n00:15:58.286 --> 00:16:03.084\nSo we believe that values-driven spending\nwill force capitalism to be better:\n\n00:16:03.108 --> 00:16:04.988\nit will drive innovation;\n\n00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:07.113\nit will make longer-lasting products;\n\n00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:09.733\nit will create better,\nmore intuitive customer service;\n\n00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:12.634\nand it will give us the opportunity\nto connect with companies\n\n00:16:12.658 --> 00:16:14.729\nthat share the values that we share.\n\n00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:16.772\nSo when we look back and step out at this\n\n00:16:16.796 --> 00:16:20.084\nand see the beginning of these trends\nthat we're seeing in our data,\n\n00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:22.957\nwe see a very hopeful picture\nfor the future of America.\n\n00:16:22.981 --> 00:16:24.149\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:24.173 --> 00:16:25.989\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Animating a photo-real digital face", "duration": "366", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_debevec_animates_a_photo_real_digital_face", "transcript": "One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo-real, digital human face. And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs, we look at human faces every day. They are very important to how we communicate with each other. As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering, in order to believe whether these things are realistic.And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face, using some computer graphics technology we've developed, and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics. And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there. And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face. By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself, who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5. This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions. And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this. We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face, and different principle directions of light from the light stage, to figure out both the coarse-scale and the fine-scale detail of her face. If we zoom in on this photograph right here, we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her, because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture.And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights \u2014 just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road, polarizers can block the shine off of the skin, so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map. Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit, we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in, and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point. If you take the difference between these two images here, you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily's skin.I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this. And this is very important light to capture, because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin. It doesn't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out. And, as a result, it's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have, the things that actually make us look like real humans.So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection, we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape, and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles. And, even more importantly, since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture, we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon, in many different facial poses and facial expressions.So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around. And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character. If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions. You can see things. Not only the face shape changes, but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs. You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture. You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there. You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down. Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry, since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face. And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination, the red and the green and the blue, diffuse the light differently, we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer. Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin, it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged, digital version of Emily. We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here. But they basically created a digital puppet of her, where you can pull on these various strings, and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took. And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry, they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called \"displacement maps\" that animate as well. These are the displacement maps here. And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.So the next process was then to animate her. We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data. So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques, they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer-generated performance. So what you're going to see now, after this, is a completely photo-real digital face. We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. We specialize in high-quality facial animation for video games and films. Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company. We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films.Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide. Here is the specular component animating. You can see all the wrinkles happening there. And there is the underlying wireframe mesh. And that is Emily herself.Now, where are we going with this here? We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6, and we're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies. This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group, who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage. And let's take a look at a computer-generated version of Bruce, running in a new environment. And thank you very much.

other.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAs a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nthat could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nin order to believe whether these things are realistic.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nAnd what I'm going to do in the next five minutes\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nis take you through a process\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nwhere we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nusing some computer graphics technology we've developed,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd we're going to try to do a photo-real face\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nof an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nBy the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nThe way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nwho was gracious enough to come to our laboratory\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nin Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nThis is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nthat allow us to photograph her\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nin a series of very controlled illumination conditions.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nWe shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nAnd we basically capture enough information\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwith video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nand different principle directions of light from the light stage,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nto figure out both the coarse-scale\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand the fine-scale detail of her face.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nIf we zoom in on this photograph right here,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nwe can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nbecause she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nto get a nice image of her facial texture.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\njust like polarized sunglasses can block\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthe glare off of the road,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\npolarizers can block the shine off of the skin,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nso we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nNow, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwe can actually bring that specular reflection\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nof the skin back in,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIf you take the difference between these two images here,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nyou can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof just the shine off of Emily's skin.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nbefore we had done this.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd this is very important light to capture,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nbecause this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nIt doesn't get underneath the translucent\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nlayers of the skin and blur out.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd, as a result, it's a very good cue\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nto the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthe things that actually make us look like real humans.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe can go from a traditional face scan\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nthat might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand augment it with information\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthat puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd, even more importantly,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nsince this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwe can shoot Emily\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nin just part of an afternoon,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nin many different facial poses and facial expressions.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIf you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nyou can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nas it goes into different facial expressions.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYou can see things. Not only the face shape changes,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nbut all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nYou can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nfrom stretched skin pores\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto the regular skin texture.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nYou can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nYou can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nHer muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIn addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nsince it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthe red and the green and the blue,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\ndiffuse the light differently,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwe can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThen, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nit actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd this is what we used\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nto give to the company Image Metrics\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nto create a rigged, digital version of Emily.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nWe're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut they basically created a digital puppet of her,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhere you can pull on these various strings,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand it actually moves her face in ways that are\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\ncompletely consistent with the scans that we took.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthey also used all of that detail\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nto create a set of what are called \"displacement maps\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat animate as well.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThese are the displacement maps here.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nAnd you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nSo the next process was then to animate her.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWe actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nSo, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthey were able to drive the facial rig\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwith the computer-generated performance.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo what you're going to see now, after this,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nis a completely photo-real digital face.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nWe can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nEmily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nWe specialize in high-quality facial animation\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfor video games and films.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nImage Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nWe specialize in high quality facial animation\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nfor video games and films.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nPaul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwe saw in the first slide.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nHere is the specular component animating.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou can see all the wrinkles happening there.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd there is the underlying wireframe mesh.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd that is Emily herself.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nNow, where are we going with this here?\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nWe've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand we're looking at taking this technology\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand applying it to whole human bodies.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nThis is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwho graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd let's take a look at a computer-generated version\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nof Bruce, running in a new environment.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd thank you very much.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Lead like the great conductors", "duration": "1251", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/itay_talgam_lead_like_the_great_conductors", "transcript": "The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting. Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting. They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff. And I go on the podium. You know, this little office of the conductor. Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle, with a lot of space. And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture. Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this. And suddenly, out of the chaos, order. Noise becomes music.And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting to think that it's all about me. (Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that. Not really. If it were that, I would just save you the talk, and teach you the gesture. So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work. Let's look at the first video. I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony. And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.(Music)Was that nice? So that was a sort of a success. Now, who should we thank for the success? I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. They don't often even look at the conductor. Then you have the clapping audience, yeah, actually taking part in doing the music. You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music. This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna. (Laughter)Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time. You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say that, \"Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor. In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.\" (Laughter) So that's a sort of a tradition. But Viennese audiences do not do that. Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that, to become part of the orchestra, and that's great. You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event.But what about the conductor? What can you say the conductor was doing, actually? Um, he was happy. And I often show this to senior management. People get annoyed. \"You come to work. How come you're so happy?\" Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness. And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music. The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time.You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body. You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah. You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience. And then you have other stories, unseen. People who build this wonderful concert hall. People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments. And all those stories are being heard at the same time. This is the true experience of a live concert. That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah? And not all conductors do just that. Let's see somebody else, a great conductor. Riccardo Muti, please.(Music)Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure. Right? He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah? So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear. Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second? Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni? You have to sing \"Aaaaaah,\" and I'll stop you. Okay? Ready?Audience: \u266b Aaaaaaah ... \u266bItay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me I feel even more redundant than I already feel. So please, wait for the conductor. Now look at me. \"Aaaaaah,\" and I stop you. Let's go.Audience: \u266b ... Aaaaaaaah ... \u266b (Laughter)Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later. (Laughter) But ... There is a vacancy for a ... But \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger. Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ... (Laughter) And then \u2014 sort of \u2014 (Laughter) So not only the instruction is clear, but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you. (Laughter) So, does it work? Yes, it works \u2014 to a certain point.When Muti is asked, \"Why do you conduct like this?\" He says, \"I'm responsible.\" Responsible in front of him. No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart, which is \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 like a third seat from the center. (Laughter) So he says, \"If I'm \u2014 (Applause) if I'm responsible for Mozart, this is going to be the only story to be told. It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it.\"And you know what happened to Muti? Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, \"You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.\" (Laughter) \"Why? Because you don't let us develop. You're using us as instruments, not as partners. And our joy of music, etc., etc. ...\" So he had to resign. Isn't that nice? (Laughter) He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy. Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control? Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.(Music)I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old. It's not true. When he was a young man of about 30, he wrote what he called \"The Ten Commandments for Conductors.\" The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong. That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better. It says: Never look at the trombones \u2014 it only encourages them. (Laughter)So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself. Do not interfere. But how does it happen? Did you see him turning pages in the score? Now, either he is senile, and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music. Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, \"Come on guys. You have to play by the book. So it's not about my story. It's not about your story. It's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation.\" Interpretation is the real story of the performer. So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control. Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.(Music)What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed. Did you see the hands? Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice. Once like a Muti, and you'll \u2014 (Claps) \u2014 clap, just once. And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay? Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ... (Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.Audience: (Claps)Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained, let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.Audience: (Claps) (Laughter)Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play. Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play. (Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism. This is a German orchestra, yes? They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other. (Laughter) \"Do you understand what this guy wants?\" And after doing that, they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together.And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says, \"Yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction. Because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra.\" Now that's great. What about the eyes? Why are the eyes closed? There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London. And he cues in a flute player like this. The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter) \"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?\" What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start? Oh yeah. He says, \"You start when you can't stand it anymore.\" (Laughter)Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything. It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head. And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure because I don't give you instruction, and yet, you have to guess my mind. So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control. Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen: Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.(Music)(Laughter) Yeah. Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way? No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do. When he does this, it's not, \"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor.\" It's not that. He says, \"This is the gesture of the music. I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation.\" That is another story.But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions? It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah? You're not really given any instructions, but the forces of the process itself keep you in place. That's what he does. The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist. It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.And that's what makes them into partners. You have the plan in your head. You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you. But here and there and that. You know what to do. And you become a partner building the rollercoaster, yeah, with sound, as you actually take the ride. This is very exciting for those players. They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later. (Laughter) It is very tiring. Yeah? But it's the best music making, like this.But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy. You also have to be very professional. And look again at this Kleiber. Can we have the next video, quickly? You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language. (Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done. Go along with the video. Look. See, second time for the same player. (Laughter) And now the third time for the same player. (Laughter) \"Wait for me after the concert. I have a short notice to give you.\" You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important. But authority is not enough to make people your partners.Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here. You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy. He's conducting Mozart. (Music) The whole orchestra is playing. (Music) Now something else. (Music) See? He is there 100 percent, but not commanding, not telling what to do. Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing. (Music)Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this. (Music) Look at the eyes. Okay. You see that? First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get. It's not feedback. It's an \"Mmmm ...\" Yeah, it comes from here. So that's a good thing. And the second thing is it's about actually being in control, but in a very special way. When Kleiber does \u2014 did you see the eyes, going from here? (Singing) You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place. So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that. And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level. So control is no longer a zero-sum game. You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together, in partnership, brings about the best music. So Kleiber is about process. Kleiber is about conditions in the world.But you need to have process and content to create the meaning. Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro. Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.(Music)Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning? Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one. (Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face? You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain. And you're playing a painful sound. And you look at Lenny and he's suffering. But not in a way that you want to stop. It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say. (Laughter) But you can see the music on his face. You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton. Now it's about you, the player, telling the story. Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story. And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to. And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together, and maybe some others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing. And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title. My friend Peter says, \"If you love something, give it away.\" So, please.(Music)(Applause)", "id": 663, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nThe magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nWhich is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nThey are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAnd I go on the podium.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nYou know, this little office of the conductor.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nOr rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nwith a lot of space.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nAnd in front of all that noise,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nyou do a very small gesture.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nSomething like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd suddenly, out of the chaos, order.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nNoise becomes music.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd this is fantastic. And it's so tempting\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nto think that it's all about me.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAll those great people here, virtuosos,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthey make noise, they need me to do that.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nNot really. If it were that,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nI would just save you the talk,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand teach you the gesture.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nSo you could go out to the world\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nLet's look at the first video.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nI hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nAnd then speak a little bit about how it comes about.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:21.958\n(Music)\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nWas that nice?\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo that was a sort of a success.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNow, who should we thank for the success?\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nI mean, obviously the orchestra musicians\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nplaying beautifully,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthe Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThey don't often even look at the conductor.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThen you have the clapping audience, yeah,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nactually taking part in doing the music.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nYou know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThis is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthat you will ever get in Vienna.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nUnlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nYou know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat, \"Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nIn Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo that's a sort of a tradition.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nBut Viennese audiences do not do that.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nHere they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nto become part of the orchestra, and that's great.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou know, audiences like you, yeah,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nmake the event.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut what about the conductor? What can you say\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthe conductor was doing, actually?\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nUm, he was happy.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd I often show this to senior management.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nPeople get annoyed.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\n\"You come to work. How come you're so happy?\"\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSomething must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\ndoes not come from\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nonly his own story and his joy of the music.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThe joy is about enabling other people's stories\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nto be heard at the same time.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nYou have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nYou have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nYou have the stories of the individuals\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nin the orchestra and in the audience.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd then you have other stories, unseen.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nPeople who build this wonderful concert hall.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nPeople who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd all those stories are being heard at the same time.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThis is the true experience of a live concert.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThat's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd not all conductors do just that.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nLet's see somebody else, a great conductor.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nRiccardo Muti, please.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\n(Music)\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nYeah, that was very short, but you could see\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nit's a completely different figure. Right?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nHe's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSo clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nCan we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nCan you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou have to sing \"Aaaaaah,\" and I'll stop you.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nOkay? Ready?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAudience: \u266b Aaaaaaah ... \u266b\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nItay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nI feel even more redundant than I already feel.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo please, wait for the conductor.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow look at me. \"Aaaaaah,\" and I stop you. Let's go.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAudience: \u266b ... Aaaaaaaah ... \u266b\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nItay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nBut ... There is a vacancy for a ...\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nBut -- (Laughter)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\n-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nNow what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd then -- sort of -- (Laughter)\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nSo not only the instruction is clear,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbut also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo, does it work? Yes, it works --\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nto a certain point.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nWhen Muti is asked, \"Why do you conduct like this?\"\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHe says, \"I'm responsible.\"\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nResponsible in front of him.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nNo he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nwhich is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nSo he says, \"If I'm --\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nif I'm responsible for Mozart,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthis is going to be the only story to be told.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIt's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it.\"\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd you know what happened to Muti?\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThree years ago he got a letter signed by\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nall 700 employees of La Scala,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nmusical employees, I mean the musicians,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nsaying, \"You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.\"\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\n\"Why? Because you don't let us develop.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nYou're using us as instruments, not as partners.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd our joy of music, etc., etc. ...\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo he had to resign. Isn't that nice?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nHe's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nWell, can you do it with less control,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nor with a different kind of control?\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nLet's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\n(Music)\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nI'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIt's not true. When he was a young man\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nof about 30, he wrote what he called\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\n\"The Ten Commandments for Conductors.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThe first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nit means that you must have done something wrong.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThat's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nIt says: Never look at the trombones --\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nit only encourages them.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, the whole idea is really to let\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nit happen by itself.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nDo not interfere.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut how does it happen? Did you see\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nhim turning pages in the score?\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nNow, either he is senile,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nOr he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n\"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSo it's not about my story. It's not about your story.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIt's only the execution of the written music,\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nno interpretation.\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nInterpretation is the real story of the performer.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nLet's see another super-conductor,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\na German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nWhat's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nDid you see the hands?\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nDid you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nOnce like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nLike Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAudience: (Claps)\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nItay Talgam: Hmm ... again.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAudience: (Claps)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nItay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nlet me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAudience: (Claps) (Laughter)\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nItay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nBecause you didn't know when to play.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nNow I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\ndoesn't know when to play.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nBut I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nThis is a German orchestra, yes?\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThey look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\n\"Do you understand what this guy wants?\"\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd after doing that,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthey really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nlead the whole ensemble in playing together.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd when Karajan is asked about it\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nhe actually says, \"Yes, the worst damage\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nI can do to my orchestra\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nis to give them a clear instruction.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBecause that would\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nprevent the ensemble, the listening to each other\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat is needed for an orchestra.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nNow that's great. What about the eyes?\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWhy are the eyes closed?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThere is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nAnd he cues in a flute player like this.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThe guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\n\"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?\"\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nWhat do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nOh yeah. He says, \"You start when you can't stand it anymore.\"\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nMeaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nIt's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nbecause I don't give you instruction,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nand yet, you have to guess my mind.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nvery firm control.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nCan we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nto the first conductor we've seen:\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nCarlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\n(Music)\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n(Laughter) Yeah.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWell, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nNo, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nWhen he does this, it's not,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n\"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nsmash it on the floor.\" It's not that.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nHe says, \"This is the gesture of the music.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nI'm opening a space for you\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto put in another layer\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nof interpretation.\"\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThat is another story.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nBut how does it really work together\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nif it doesn't give them instructions?\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIt's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nYou're not really given any instructions,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nbut the forces of the process itself keep you in place.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThat's what he does.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nThe interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nIt's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd that's what makes them into partners.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nYou have the plan in your head.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nYou know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nBut here and there and that. You know what to do.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd you become a partner building the rollercoaster,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nyeah, with sound,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nas you actually take the ride.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThis is very exciting for those players.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThey do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nIt is very tiring. Yeah?\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nBut it's the best music making, like this.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nBut of course it's not only about motivation\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nand giving them a lot of physical energy.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nYou also have to be very professional.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd look again at this Kleiber.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nCan we have the next video, quickly?\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nYou'll see what happens when there is a mistake.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\n(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\n(Music)\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nAnd now there is a trumpet player who\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\ndoes something not exactly the way it should be done.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nGo along with the video. Look.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSee, second time for the same player.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\n(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n\"Wait for me after the concert.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nI have a short notice to give you.\"\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nYou know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nBut authority is not enough to make people your partners.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nLet's see the next video, please. See what happens here.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nYou might be surprised having seen Kleiber\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nas such a hyperactive guy.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nHe's conducting Mozart.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThe whole orchestra is playing.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nNow something else.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nSee? He is there 100 percent,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nbut not commanding, not telling what to do.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nRather enjoying what the soloist is doing.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nAnother solo now. See what you can pick up from this.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nLook at the eyes.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nOkay. You see that?\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nFirst of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nIt's not feedback. It's an \"Mmmm ...\" Yeah, it comes from here.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nAnd the second thing is\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nit's about actually being in control,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nbut in a very special way.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWhen Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\ngoing from here? (Singing)\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nYou know what happens? Gravitation is no more.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nKleiber not only creates a process,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nbut also creates the conditions in the world\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nin which this process takes place.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nSo again, the oboe player\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nis completely autonomous\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand therefore happy and proud of his work,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand creative and all of that.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nAnd the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nSo control is no longer a zero-sum game.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nYou have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nin partnership, brings about the best music.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo Kleiber is about process.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nKleiber is about conditions in the world.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nBut you need to have process and content to create the meaning.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nLenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nSince he was a great teacher,\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nLenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:17.958\n(Music)\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nDo you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nWell he had a wonderful expression, but only one.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nDid you see Lenny's face?\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nYou know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nAnd you're playing a painful sound.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd you look at Lenny and he's suffering.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nBut not in a way that you want to stop.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nIt's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nBut you can see the music on his face.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nYou can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nNow it's about you, the player,\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\ntelling the story.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nNow it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nAnd even briefly, you become the storyteller\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nto which the community, the whole community, listens to.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nAnd Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nNow, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nand maybe some others,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nyou can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAnd for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nMy friend Peter says,\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\n\"If you love something, give it away.\" So, please.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:25.958\n(Music)\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "1.3m reasons to re-invent the syringe", "duration": "285", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marc_koska_the_devastating_toll_of_syringe_reuse", "transcript": "Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS, the transmission of AIDS. I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know, kills approximately one million people a year. The reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year. This young girl and her friend that I met in an orphanage in Delhi were HIV positive from a syringe. And what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out \u2014 and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor \u2014 the parents threw them out on the street. And hence they ended up in an orphanage.And it comes from situations like this where you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners, blindly giving an injection to someone. And the injection is so valuable, that the people basically trust the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times, to do the right thing. But in fact they're not. And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem between people in high-virus areas.This video we took undercover, which shows you, over a half an hour period, a tray of medicines of 42 vials, which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India. And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe was filmed being unwrapped. They started with two and they ended with two. And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray, which is their sort of modular station, and dropping the syringe she's just used back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again. So you can imagine the scale of this problem. And in fact in India alone, 62 percent of all injections given are unsafe.These kids in Pakistan don't go to school. They are lucky. They already have a job. And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals, wash them, and in the course of this, obviously picking them up they injure themselves. And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets for literally more money than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre. In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him, picked up a syringe and pricked his finger \u2014 I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end \u2014 and immediately whipped out a box of matches, lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger, giving me full assurance that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.In China, recycling is a major issue. And they are collected en mass \u2014 you can see the scale of it here \u2014 and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes, and then put back out on the street. So recycling and reuse are the major issues here. But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia. In all schools in Indonesia, there is usually a toy seller in the playground. The toy seller, in this case, had syringes, which they usually do, next door to the diggers, which is obviously what you would expect. And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols. They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent. And they are having great fun. But they also drink from them while they're in their breaks, because it's hot. And they squirt the water into their mouths. And these are used with traces of blood visible.So we need a better product. And we need better information. And I think, if I can just borrow this camera, I was going to show you my invention, which I came up with. So, it's a normal-looking syringe. You load it up in the normal way. This is made on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license. You give the injection and then put it down. If someone then tries to reuse it, it locks and breaks afterwards. It's very, very simple. Thank you. (Applause) And it costs the same as a normal syringe. And in comparison, a Coca-Cola is 10 times the price. And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.And I have an information charity which has done huge scale amount of work in India. And we're very proud of giving information to people, so that little kids like this don't do stupid things. Thank you very much.

Malaria, as we all know,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nkills approximately one million people a year.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nThe reuse of syringes now exceeds that\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nand kills 1.3 million people a year.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nThis young girl and her friend\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthat I met in an orphanage in Delhi\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nwere HIV positive from a syringe.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nAnd what was so sad about this particular story\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nwas that once their parents had found out --\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nthe parents threw them out on the street.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nAnd hence they ended up in an orphanage.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd it comes from situations like this where\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nyou have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nblindly giving an injection to someone.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd the injection is so valuable,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nthat the people basically trust\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthe doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nto do the right thing. But in fact they're not.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nbetween people in high-virus areas.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nThis video we took undercover,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwhich shows you, over a half an hour period,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\na tray of medicines of 42 vials,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwhich are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd over the course of half an hour, not one syringe\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwas filmed being unwrapped.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nThey started with two and they ended with two.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nwhich is their sort of modular station,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand dropping the syringe she's just used\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nback in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nSo you can imagine the scale of this problem.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nAnd in fact in India alone, 62 percent\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nof all injections given\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nare unsafe.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nThese kids in Pakistan don't go to school.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThey are lucky. They already have a job.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd that job is that they go around and pick up syringes\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nfrom the back of hospitals,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nwash them, and in the course of this,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nobviously picking them up they injure themselves.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd then they repackage them and sell them out on markets\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nfor literally more money\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nthan a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nIn an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\npicked up a syringe and pricked his finger --\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand immediately whipped out a box of matches,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nlit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ngiving me full assurance\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nIn China, recycling is a major issue.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand then put back out on the street.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nSo recycling and reuse\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nare the major issues here.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nBut there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nIn all schools in Indonesia,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthere is usually a toy seller in the playground.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe toy seller, in this case,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nhad syringes, which they usually do,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nnext door to the diggers, which is obviously\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhat you would expect.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThey squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nAnd they are having great fun.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nBut they also drink from them\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhile they're in their breaks, because it's hot.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd they squirt the water into their mouths.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd these are used with traces of blood visible.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nSo we need a better product. And we need better information.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nAnd I think, if I can just borrow this camera,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nI was going to show you my invention,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwhich I came up with.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nSo, it's a normal-looking syringe.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nYou load it up in the normal way. This is made\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\non existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nYou give the injection and then put it down.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nIf someone then tries to reuse it,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nit locks and breaks afterwards.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIt's very, very simple. Thank you.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd it costs the same as a normal syringe.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd in comparison, a Coca-Cola\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nis 10 times the price.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd I have an information charity\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nwhich has done huge scale amount of work in India.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd we're very proud of giving information to people,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nso that little kids like this don't do stupid things.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:36.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Navigating our global future", "duration": "426", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ian_goldin_navigating_our_global_future", "transcript": "The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable. The best minds in the best institutions generally get it wrong. This is in technology. This is in the area of politics, where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong. And it's clearly in the area of finance. With institutions established to think about the future, the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming. Over 20,000 economists whose job it is, competitive entry to get there, couldn't see what was happening.Globalization is getting more complex. And this change is getting more rapid. The future will be more unpredictable. Urbanization, integration, coming together, leads to a new renaissance. It did this a thousand years ago. The last 40 years have been extraordinary times. Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years. It took from the Stone Age to achieve that. Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population, despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period. And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth. A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential for innovation, for development.But there is an underbelly. There are two Achilles' heels of globalization. There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality \u2014 those that are left out, those that feel angry, those that are not participating. Globalization has not been inclusive. The second Achilles' heel is complexity \u2014 a growing fragility, a growing brittleness. What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else. This is a systemic risk, systemic shock. We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu. It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology. There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement in what you can get for the same price in computing by 2030. That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been. It will continue. Our computers, our systems will be as primitive as the Apollo's are for today. Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine. Our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago. So what will this do? It will create huge opportunities in technology. Miniaturization as well. There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies, in our brains, and in the air. This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential, not least in the area of medicine. This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford, from an embryonic stem cell. We can develop any part of the body. Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin \u2014 able to replicate parts of the body. Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine. I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030, because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body. But the question is, \"Who will have it?\"The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics. The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified, something which goes three times faster, lasts for three times longer, we could produce, as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years, using about the same amount of food. But will this only be available for the super rich, for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics? Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future? (Laughter)So the big question for us is, \"How do we manage this technological change?\" How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology, a technology which means that not only as we grow older, that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support the populations of the future? One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins. There is unlikely to be a pension or a retirement age in 2030. These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries. So forget about retirements if you're young. Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going. Of course, migration will become even more important. The war on talent, the need to attract people at all skill ranges, to push us around in our wheelchairs, but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.The employment in the rich countries will go down from about 800 to about 700 million of these people. This would imply a massive leap in migration. So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today, of migration, will be turned on their head, as we search for people to help us sort out our pensions and our economies in the future. And then, the systemic risks. We understand that these will become much more virulent, that what we see today is this interweaving of societies, of systems, fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems. Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.The collapse in biodiversity, climate change, pandemics, financial crises: these will be the currency that we will think about. And so a new awareness will have to arise, of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves, in a new way, and come together as a community to manage systemic risk. It's going to require innovation. It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization could also be its downfall. This could be our best century ever because of the achievements, or it could be our worst. And of course we need to worry about the individuals, particularly the individuals that feel that they've been left out in one way or another.An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity, will have the capacity, by 2030, to destroy the planet, to wreck everything, through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen. How do we begin to weave these tapestries together? How do we think about complex systems in new ways? That will be the challenge of the scholars, and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future. The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now. We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized. It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring. We have to develop a new way of managing the planet, collectively, through collective wisdom.We know, and I know from my own experience, that amazing things can happen, when individuals and societies come together to change their future. I left South Africa, and 15 years later, after thinking I would never go back, I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela. This was a miracle. We can create miracles, collectively, in our lifetime. It is vital that we do so. It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED, that the ideas that we think about look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century, and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.

Wondering, therefore, how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen.Okay, so, most people only wondered that occasionally, like today, in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them. But what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know. They wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing, and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation, be warmer, cooler, safer, in less pain. I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better.In every aspect of their lives, they wished for progress, just as we do. But they failed, almost completely, to make any. They didn't know how to. Discoveries like fire happened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view, the world never improved. Nothing new was learned.The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899: radioactivity. Within 40 years, physicists discovered the whole explanation, expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols. But never mind the symbols. Think how many discoveries they represent. Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course. But isotopes, particles of electricity, antimatter, neutrinos, the conversion of mass to energy \u2014 that's E=mc^2 \u2014 gamma rays, transmutation. That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explained starlight and other ancient mysteries, and new, unexpected phenomena.That all that, discovered in 40 years, had not been in the previous hundred thousand, was not for lack of thinking about stars, and all those other urgent problems they had. They even arrived at answers, such as myths, that dominated their lives, yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth. The tragedy of that protracted stagnation isn't sufficiently recognized, I think. These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things. But that ability to make progress remained almost unused, until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe.Or so we should hope. Because that event was the Scientific Revolution, ever since which our knowledge of the physical world, and of how to adapt it to our wishes, has been growing relentlessly. Now, what had changed? What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid, open-ended discovery? How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it is possible to know. Worryingly, there is no consensus about what it is. So, I'll tell you. But I'll have to backtrack a little first.Before the Scientific Revolution, they believed that everything important, knowable, was already known, enshrined in ancient writings, institutions, and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb \u2014 which were, however, entrenched as dogmas, along with many falsehoods. So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little. And therefore progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men, priests, traditions and rulers. Which is why the Scientific Revolution had to have a wider context.The Enlightenment, a revolution in how people sought knowledge, trying not to rely on authority. \"Take no one's word for it.\" But that can't be what made the difference. Authorities had been rejected before, many times. And that rarely, if ever, caused anything like the Scientific Revolution. At the time, what they thought distinguished science was a radical idea about things unseen, known as empiricism. All knowledge derives from the senses. Well, we've seen that that can't be true. It did help by promoting observation and experiment. But, from the outset, it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it.Knowledge comes from the senses. In what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics, in which, Galileo rightly said, the book of nature is written. Look at the world. You don't see equations carved on to the mountainsides. If you did, it would be because people had carved them. By the way, why don't we do that? What's wrong with us? (Laughter)Empiricism is inadequate because, well, scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen. And the unseen, you have to admit, doesn't come to us through the senses. We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars. We don't see the origin of species. We don't see the curvature of space-time, and other universes. But we know about those things. How?Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction. The unseen resembles the seen. But it doesn't. You know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved? It was a photograph, not of space-time, but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there. And the evidence for evolution? Some rocks and some finches. And parallel universes? Again: dots there, rather than there, on a screen. What we see, in all these cases, bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible \u2014 only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.\"Ah!\" say creationists. \"So you admit it's all interpretation. No one has ever seen evolution. We see rocks. You have your interpretation. We have ours. Yours comes from guesswork, ours from the Bible.\" But what creationist and empiricists both ignore is that, in that sense, no one has ever seen a bible either, that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive. Brains only detect nerve impulses. And they don't perceive even those as what they really are, namely electrical crackles. So we perceive nothing as what it really is.Our connection to reality is never just perception. It's always, as Karl Popper put it, theory-laden. Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything. It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork, tested by observation, not derived from it. So, were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates? No. Contrary to what's usually said, testability is common, in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking. Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday has got a testable prediction.Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons. Hades, God of the Underworld, kidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring, and negotiates a forced marriage contract, requiring her to return regularly, and lets her go. And each year, she is magically compelled to return. And her mother, Demeter, Goddess of the Earth, is sad, and makes it cold and barren. That myth is testable. If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness, then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously. So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest, they'd have known that their theory is false.So what was wrong with that myth, and with all pre-scientific thinking, and what, then, made that momentous difference? I think there is one thing you have to care about. And that implies testability, the scientific method, the Enlightenment, and everything. And here is the crucial thing. There is such a thing as a defect in a story. I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation. What does that mean? Well, explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen, that accounts for what's seen.Because the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities. Why a marriage contract and not any other reason for regular annual action? Here is one. Persephone wasn't released. She escaped, and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades, with her Spring powers. She cools his domain with Spring air, venting heat up to the surface, creating summer. That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth. It's equally testable. Yet what it asserts about reality is, in many ways, the opposite. And that is possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons, except via the myth itself.This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation, because, without a functional reason to prefer one of countless variants, advocating one of them, in preference to the others, is irrational. So, for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress, seek good explanations, the ones that can't be easily varied, while still explaining the phenomena.Now, our current explanation of seasons is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that, so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year, and away for the other half. Better put that up. (Laughter) That's a good explanation: hard to vary, because every detail plays a functional role. For instance, we know, independently of seasons, that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less, and that a spinning sphere, in space, points in a constant direction. And the tilt also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year, and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres. If they'd been observed in phase, the theory would have been refuted. But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation, hard to vary, makes the crucial difference.If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that. For instance, when Demeter is upset, she banishes heat from her vicinity, into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer. So, being proved wrong by observation, and changing their theory accordingly, still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons, because their explanation was bad: easy to vary. And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable. If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted, its defenders would have had nowhere to go. No easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres.The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress. It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment. So, in science, two false approaches blight progress. One is well known: untestable theories. But the more important one is explanationless theories. Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue, but you aren't given a hard-to-vary account of what causes that trend, you're being told a wizard did it.When you are told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes \u2014 but not how gene percentages confer rights \u2014 wizard. When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate has been settled because there is evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited, but they don't explain how genes cause opinions, they've settled nothing. They are saying that our opinions are caused by wizards, and presumably so are their own. That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world. It's a fact that is, itself, unseen, yet impossible to vary. Thank you.

yearning to know.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nThey wished they knew\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nhow to prevent their food supply\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nfrom sometimes failing,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand how they could rest when they were tired\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwithout risking starvation,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nbe warmer, cooler, safer,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nin less pain.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nI bet those prehistoric cave artists\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nwould have loved to know\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nhow to draw better.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nIn every aspect of their lives,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthey wished for progress, just as we do.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nBut they failed, almost completely, to make any.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThey didn't know how to.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nDiscoveries like fire\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nhappened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nthe world never improved.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nNothing new was learned.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThe first clue to the origin of starlight\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nhappened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nWithin 40 years,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nphysicists discovered the whole explanation,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nexpressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nBut never mind the symbols.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThink how many discoveries\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthey represent.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nBut isotopes, particles of electricity,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nantimatter,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nneutrinos,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthe conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc^2 --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ngamma rays,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\ntransmutation.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThat ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwas achieved through these same theories\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nthat explained starlight\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand other ancient mysteries,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand new, unexpected phenomena.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThat all that, discovered in 40 years,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nhad not been in the previous hundred thousand,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nwas not for lack of thinking\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nabout stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThey even arrived at answers,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nsuch as myths,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthat dominated their lives,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nyet bore almost no resemblance\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto the truth.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThe tragedy of that protracted stagnation\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nisn't sufficiently recognized, I think.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nThese were people with brains of\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nessentially the same design\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nthat eventually did discover all those things.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nBut that ability to make progress\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nremained almost unused,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nuntil the event that\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nrevolutionized the human condition\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand changed the universe.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nOr so we should hope.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nBecause that event was the\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nScientific Revolution,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\never since which our knowledge\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nof the physical world,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand of how to adapt it to our wishes,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nhas been growing relentlessly.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nNow, what had changed?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nWhat were people now doing for the first time\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat made that difference\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nbetween stagnation\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand rapid, open-ended discovery?\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nHow to make that difference\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nis surely the most important universal truth\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthat it is possible to know.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nWorryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo, I'll tell you.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut I'll have to backtrack a little first.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nBefore the Scientific Revolution,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthey believed that everything important, knowable,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwas already known,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nenshrined in ancient writings, institutions,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nand in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwhich were, however, entrenched as dogmas,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nalong with many falsehoods.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nSo they believed that knowledge came from authorities\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthat actually knew very little.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd therefore progress\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndepended on learning how to reject\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthe authority of learned men,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\npriests, traditions and rulers.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWhich is why the Scientific Revolution\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nhad to have a wider context.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThe Enlightenment, a revolution in how\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\npeople sought knowledge,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\ntrying not to rely on authority.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\n\"Take no one's word for it.\"\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nBut that can't be what made the difference.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAuthorities had been rejected before, many times.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd that rarely, if ever,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ncaused anything like the Scientific Revolution.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAt the time, what they thought\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\ndistinguished science\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwas a radical idea about things unseen,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nknown as empiricism.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAll knowledge derives from the senses.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWell, we've seen that that can't be true.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIt did help by promoting\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nobservation and experiment.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut, from the outset, it was obvious\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat there was something horribly wrong with it.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nKnowledge comes from the senses.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIn what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nin which, Galileo rightly said,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthe book of nature is written.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nLook at the world. You don't see equations\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\ncarved on to the mountainsides.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIf you did, it would be because people\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nhad carved them.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nBy the way, why don't we do that?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nWhat's wrong with us?\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nEmpiricism is inadequate\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbecause, well,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nscientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd the unseen, you have to admit,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\ndoesn't come to us through the senses.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWe don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe don't see the origin of species.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nWe don't see the curvature of space-time,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand other universes.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut we know about those things.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nHow?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nWell, the classic empiricist answer is induction.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThe unseen resembles the seen.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut it doesn't.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nYou know what the clinching evidence was\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nthat space-time is curved?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nIt was a photograph, not of space-time,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nbut of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd the evidence for evolution?\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nSome rocks and some finches.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd parallel universes? Again: dots there,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nrather than there, on a screen.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWhat we see, in all these cases,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nbears no resemblance to the reality\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthat we conclude is responsible --\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nonly a long chain of theoretical reasoning\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand interpretation connects them.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n\"Ah!\" say creationists.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n\"So you admit it's all interpretation.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nNo one has ever seen evolution.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nWe see rocks.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nYou have your interpretation. We have ours.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nYours comes from guesswork,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nours from the Bible.\"\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut what creationist and empiricists both ignore\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nis that, in that sense,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nno one has ever seen a bible either,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthat the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nBrains only detect nerve impulses.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd they don't perceive even those as what they really are,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nnamely electrical crackles.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nSo we perceive nothing as what it really is.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nOur connection to reality\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis never just perception.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nIt's always, as Karl Popper put it,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\ntheory-laden.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nScientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's like all knowledge.

I mean a bad explanation.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nWhat does that mean? Well, explanation\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nis an assertion about what's there, unseen,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthat accounts for what's seen.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nBecause the explanatory role\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nof Persephone's marriage contract\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\ncould be played equally well\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nby infinitely many other\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nad hoc entities.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nWhy a marriage contract and not any other reason\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nfor regular annual action?\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nHere is one. Persephone wasn't released.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nShe escaped, and returns every spring\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nto take revenge on Hades,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwith her Spring powers.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nShe cools his domain with Spring air,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nventing heat up to the surface, creating summer.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThat accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nIt's equally testable.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nYet what it asserts about reality\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nis, in many ways, the opposite.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd that is possible because\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthe details of the original myth\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nare unrelated to seasons,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nexcept via the myth itself.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThis easy variability\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nis the sign of a bad explanation,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nbecause, without a functional reason to prefer\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:44.958\none of countless variants,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nadvocating one of them, in preference to the others,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nis irrational.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo, for the essence of what\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nmakes the difference to enable progress,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nseek good explanations,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nthe ones that can't be easily varied,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwhile still explaining the phenomena.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nNow, our current explanation of seasons\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nis that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nso each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nand away for the other half.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nBetter put that up.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThat's a good explanation: hard to vary,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbecause every detail plays a functional role.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nFor instance, we know, independently of seasons,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthat surfaces tilted away\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nfrom radiant heat are heated less,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nand that a spinning sphere, in space,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\npoints in a constant direction.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd the tilt also explains\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nthe sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand predicts that the seasons\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwill be out of phase in the two hemispheres.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nIf they'd been observed in phase,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe theory would have been refuted.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBut now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nhard to vary, makes the crucial difference.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nIf the ancient Greeks had found out\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nabout seasons in Australia,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthey could have easily varied their myth\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nto predict that.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nFor instance, when Demeter is upset,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nshe banishes heat from her vicinity,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\ninto the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo, being proved wrong by observation,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand changing their theory accordingly,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nstill wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\none jot closer to understanding seasons,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbecause their explanation was bad: easy to vary.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd it's only when an explanation is good\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nthat it even matters whether it's testable.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIf the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nits defenders would have had nowhere to go.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nNo easily implemented change\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\ncould make that tilt\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\ncause the same seasons in both hemispheres.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nThe search for hard-to-vary explanations\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nis the origin of all progress.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's the basic regulating principle\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nof the Enlightenment.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nSo, in science, two false approaches blight progress.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nOne is well known: untestable theories.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nBut the more important one is explanationless theories.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nWhenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nbut you aren't given a hard-to-vary account\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nof what causes that

They're made using Victorian technologies. This involves blueprints, industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers. All of this effort results in an inert object. And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities. This is not sustainable. I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language. Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world, through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism. And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy. And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way. So, I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture. But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture, and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach. That means we're generating them from scratch. One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc, and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter. Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in, when we're thinking about sustainable materials.So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell. Now all this is \u2014 and it's magic \u2014 is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it. And it has no DNA. This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living. It is able to move around its environment. It can follow chemical gradients. It can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural. So here we are. These are protocells, patterning their environment. We don't know how they do that yet. Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin. Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth. This is a violent process.Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate. And that's the shell around that globular fat. They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there. So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture, which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods which impose structure upon matter. That can't be energetically sensible.So, bottom-up materials actually exist today. They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times. If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today, and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone. And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other. And then they are fossilized over millions of years.Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting. It looks beautiful. But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere. Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide. Would it give this block of limestone new properties? Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow. It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material. They think big. Okay? So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials, we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls, or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water. So, one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice. Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea, and is built upon wooden piles. So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice. And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.So, here is the technology we have today. This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials. We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this. Now, this is the very interesting part. We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals. What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles.So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light, toward the dark foundations. We've observed this in the laboratory. The protocells can actually move away from the light. They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species. So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them. And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while. It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice. But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city. An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide. Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way. But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere. This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries. So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies, and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.Secondly, these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems, which means they can perform in similar ways. They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture. And finally, an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.

So I'm having to make them.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI'm working with architect Neil Spiller\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nat the Bartlett School of Architecture,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand we're collaborating with international scientists\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nin order to generate these new materials\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nfrom a bottom up approach.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThat means we're generating them from scratch.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nOne of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand he's really interested in the transition from\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\ninert to living matter.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nNow, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nwhen we're thinking about sustainable materials.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nSo, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nNow all this is -- and it's magic --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nis a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd it has no DNA.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThis little bag is able to conduct itself\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nin a way that can only be described as living.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nIt is able to move around its environment.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nIt can follow chemical gradients.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIt can undergo complex reactions,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nsome of which are happily architectural.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nSo here we are. These are protocells,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\npatterning their environment.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWe don't know how they do that yet.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nHere, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nNow, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThis is a violent process.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nHere, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nout of the atmosphere\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand turn it into carbonate.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd that's the shell around that globular fat.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThey are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\ntowards creating bottom-up construction approaches\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nfor architecture,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwhich contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwhich impose structure upon matter.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThat can't be energetically sensible.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nSo, bottom-up materials\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nactually exist today.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThey've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nIf you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand have a look at the brickwork,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhich I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nyou'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd if you look even closer,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nyou'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand little skeletons that are piled upon each other.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd then they are fossilized over millions of years.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nNow a block of limestone, in itself,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nisn't particularly that interesting.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIt looks beautiful.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nBut imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nif the surfaces were actually\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nin conversation with the atmosphere.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nMaybe they could extract carbon dioxide.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nWould it give this block of limestone new properties?\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nWell, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt might be able to self-repair, and even respond\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nto dramatic changes\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nin the immediate environment.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSo, architects are never happy\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwith just one block of an interesting material.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nThey think big. Okay?\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSo when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwe can start thinking about ecological interventions\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nlike repair of atolls,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nor reclamation of parts of a city\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthat are damaged by water.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo, one of these examples\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwould of course be the historic city of Venice.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nNow, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand is built upon wooden piles.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nSo we've devised a way by which it may be possible\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfor the protocell technology that we're working with\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nto sustainably reclaim Venice.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd architect Christian Kerrigan\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nhas come up with a series of designs that show us\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nhow it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nunderneath the city.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo, here is the technology we have today.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis is our protocell technology,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.958\neffectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand depositing it in a very complex environment,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nagainst natural materials.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nWe're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nNow, this is the very interesting part.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWe don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nWhat we need it to do is to be\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\ncreatively crafted around the wooden piles.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nmoving away from the light,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\ntoward the dark foundations.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nWe've observed this in the laboratory.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThe protocells can actually move away from the light.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThey can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo that these don't just exist as one entity,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nwe kind of chemically engineer them.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd so here the protocells are depositing their limestone\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nvery specifically, around the foundations of Venice,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\neffectively petrifying it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nNow, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nIt's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nin order for us to become ready\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto test it out in a case-by-case basis\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\non the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nBut gradually, as the buildings are repaired,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwe will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAn accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAlso it will attract the local marine ecology,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwho will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat connects a city to the natural world\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nin a very direct and immediate way.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut perhaps the most exciting thing about it\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nis that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThis is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nwhich means that this technology is just as appropriate\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nfor developing countries as it is\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nfor First World countries.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nas a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand building architectures from a bottom-up approach.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSecondly, these metabolic materials\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nhave some of the properties of living systems,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nwhich means they can perform in similar ways.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThey can expect to have a lot of forms and functions\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwithin the practice of architecture.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAnd finally, an observer in the future\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nmarveling at a beautiful structure in the environment\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nmay find it almost impossible to tell\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhether this structure\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nhas been created by a natural process\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nor an artificial one.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThank you.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The year I was homeless", "duration": "429", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_blanton_the_year_i_was_homeless", "transcript": "I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things. And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible. I became one of the working homeless. I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel. His death hit me pretty hard. And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.I've camped my whole life. And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip. So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things. One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person. Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it. Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.At first, living in the van was great. I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly. And I had time to relax and to grieve. But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in. My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills. What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer. And it became impossible to park anywhere \u2014 (Laughs) \u2014 without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot. The cat came and went through an open window in the van. The doggy went into doggy day care. And I sweated. Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops. Or I washed up in public rest rooms.Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep. Food rotted in the heat. Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable. I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat. And I refused to give them up, so I stayed in the van. And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing. And they stayed there. And I faced a whole new set of challenges. I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police. I didn't always succeed.But I felt out of control of my life. And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away. I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped. My talent, my integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same. But I had changed somehow. I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic. And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days. I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line. I just wasn't drunk or high. And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, \"You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?\" Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did. Then the professor listened to my story and he said, \"You have a job. You have hope. The real homeless don't have hope.\" A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal. And I remember thinking, \"If I killed myself, no one would notice.\"A friend told me, shortly after that, that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national T.V. An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book. And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing. And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of \"Meet the Press,\" was talking about my writing, while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, I started laughing. You should too. (Laughter)I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman? So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book. And I stood there. And I reread my essay. And I cried. Because I was a writer. I was a writer. Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee. I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends. And I started writing again. By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist. I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment. I was no longer homeless. And I was no longer invisible.Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs, and live in their cars. But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets. So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible. But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope. The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope. And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless. I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet. But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep, or what their life situation is at any given time. Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and today I'm speaking at TED. Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

And I decided\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthat living in a van for a year to do this\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nwould be like one long camping trip.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSo I packed my cat, my Rottweiler\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand drove off into the sunset,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nhaving fully failed to realize three critical things.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nOne: that society equates\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nliving in a permanent structure, even a shack,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nwith having value as a person.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nTwo: I failed to realize how quickly\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nthe negative perceptions of other people\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\ncan impact our reality, if we let it.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThree: I failed to realize\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nthat homelessness is an attitude,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nnot a lifestyle.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAt first, living in the van was great.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nI showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I had time to relax and to grieve.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nBut then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nMy freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nto pay the bills.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nWhat had been a really mild spring\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nturned into a miserably hot summer.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nAnd it became impossible to park anywhere --\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:52.958\n(Laughs)\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\n-- without being very obvious\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nthat I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThe cat came and went through an open window in the van.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThe doggy went into doggy day care.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd I sweated.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWhenever I could, I used\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nemployee showers in office buildings and truck stops.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nOr I washed up in public rest rooms.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nNighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nmaking it difficult or impossible to sleep.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nFood rotted in the heat.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nIce in my ice chest melted within hours,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand it was pretty miserable.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nI couldn't afford to find an apartment,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nor couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nto have the Rottweiler and the cat.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd I refused to give them up,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nso I stayed in the van.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd when the heat made me too sick\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nto walk the 50 feet to the public restroom\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\noutside my van at night,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nI used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nWhen winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nbelow freezing. And they stayed there.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd I faced a whole new set of challenges.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nI parked a different place every night\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nso I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nI didn't always succeed.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut I felt out of control of my life.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd I don't know when or how it happened,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nbut the speed at which I went\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nfrom being a talented writer and journalist\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto being a homeless woman, living in a van,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\ntook my breath away.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nI hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nMy talent, my integrity, my values,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\neverything about me remained the same.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nBut I had changed somehow.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI just wasn't drunk or high.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd when several of the homeless men realized that,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nincluding a former university professor,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthey said, \"You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nOther homeless people didn't see me as homeless,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nbut I did.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThen the professor listened to my story and he said,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\n\"You have a job. You have hope.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThe real homeless don't have hope.\"\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nA reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nleft me suicidal. And I remember thinking,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n\"If I killed myself, no one would notice.\"\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nA friend told me, shortly after that,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthat she had heard that Tim Russert,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\na nationally renowned journalist,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nhad been talking about me on national T.V.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAn essay I'd written about my father,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthe year before he died, was in Tim's new book.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of \"Meet the Press,\"\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwas talking about my writing,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwhile I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI started laughing.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nYou should too.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nI started laughing\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbecause it got to the point where,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwas I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nSo I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd I stood there. And I reread my essay.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd I cried.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nBecause I was a writer.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nI was a writer.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nShortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd I started writing again.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nBy the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI was no longer homeless.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd I was no longer invisible.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThousands of people work full and part-time jobs,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand live in their cars.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut society continues to stigmatize and criminalize\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nliving in your vehicle or on the streets.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nSo the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nBut if you ever meet one,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nengage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThe human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nBut I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\npeople are not where they live,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwhere they sleep,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nor what their life situation is at any given time.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThree years ago I was living in a van\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nin a Wal-Mart parking lot,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand today I'm speaking at TED.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nHope always, always finds a way. Thank you.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Symmetry, reality's riddle", "duration": "1099", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marcus_du_sautoy_symmetry_reality_s_riddle", "transcript": "On the 30th of May, 1832, a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris. (Gunshot) A peasant, who was walking to market that morning, ran towards where the gunshot had come from, and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor, clearly shot by a dueling wound. The young man's name was Evariste Galois. He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time. Galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother. And the last words he said to his brother were, \"Don't cry for me, Alfred. I need all the courage I can muster to die at the age of 20.\"It wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics for which Galois was famous. But a few years earlier, while still at school, he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time. And he wrote to the academicians in Paris, trying to explain his theory. But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote. (Laughter) This is how he wrote most of his mathematics.So, the night before that duel, he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough. So he stayed up the whole night, writing away, trying to explain his ideas. And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny, he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation. Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.But contained inside those documents was a new language, a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science \u2014 namely symmetry. Now, symmetry is almost nature's language. It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world. For example, molecular structure. What crystals are possible, we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object, because they are generally rather nasty. The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object. And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well. But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important, because it actually communicates genetic information.I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical. And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful, you're probably drawn to the lower two. Because it is hard to make symmetry. And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing and therefore you'll make a good mate. So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information.Symmetry can also help us to explain what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there, it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space.And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely, the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us. He wrote, \"The universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word.\"But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry. Artists too love to play around with symmetry. They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it. Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in \"The Magic Mountain.\" He has a character describing the snowflake, and he says he \"shuddered at its perfect precision, found it deathly, the very marrow of death.\"But what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them. And a beautiful example of this I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine in Japan, Professor Kurokawa. And he took me up to the temples in Nikko. And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs. And the gateway you see behind has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them. Seven of them are exactly the same, and the eighth one is turned upside down.And I said to Professor Kurokawa, \"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.\" And he said, \"No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act.\" And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese \"Essays in Idleness\" from the 14th century, in which the essayist wrote, \"In everything, uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\" Even when building the Imperial Palace, they always leave one place unfinished.But if I had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life, being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada. This is a palace celebrating symmetry. Recently I took my family \u2014 we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love. This is my son Tamer. You can see he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra. But I wanted to try and enrich him. I think one of the problems about school mathematics is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in. So, I wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.You see it already. Immediately you go in, the reflective symmetry in the water. But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening. The Moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls. So they explored a more geometric art. And so what is symmetry? The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions. What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls, do they have the same symmetries? Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions. For Galois, symmetry \u2014 unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly \u2014 for Galois, symmetry was all about motion. What can you do to a symmetrical object, move it in some way, so it looks the same as before you moved it? I like to describe it as the magic trick moves. What can you do to something? You close your eyes. I do something, put it back down again. It looks like it did before it started.So, for example, the walls in the Alhambra \u2014 I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place, rotate them by 90 degrees, put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there. And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved. But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the Alhambra. But it's also about producing a language to describe this. And the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically \u2014 so brace yourselves \u2014 push you a little bit to understand how this language works, which enables us to capture what is symmetry. So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here. Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish. What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same? Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started. I could rotate it by a third of a turn, or a half a turn, or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn. And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn. And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started.Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry. Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started? I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I? It's got no reflective symmetry. But what I could do is just leave it where it is, pick it up, and put it down again. And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry. Actually, the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians. It seems mad to talk about nothing. And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical \u2014 so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.So, this object has six symmetries. And what about the triangle? Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise. But now this has some reflectional symmetry. I can reflect it in the line through X, or the line through Y, or the line through Z. Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is. So both of these objects have six symmetries. Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport, and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it.So here is a little question for you. And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer. The Rubik's Cube. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have? How many things can I do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube? Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on, and count how many symmetries there are. And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects. What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries, but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object. If I do one magic trick move followed by another, the combination is a third magic trick move. And here we see Galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object. For example, what if I turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn, and then a third of a turn?So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, are the names for the rotations. B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot to the B on the starfish. And so on. So what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn, followed by C, which is a third of a turn? Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn, followed by a third of a turn, the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go. So the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work. I do one followed by another, the answer is it's rotation D, half a turn. What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference? Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn. Of course, it doesn't make any difference. It still ends up at half a turn.And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other. But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle. Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle, one after the other. Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise, and reflect in the line through X. Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z to start with. Now, let's do it in a different order. Let's do the reflection in X first, followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise. The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different. It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.Now it matters what order you do the operations in. And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects \u2014 they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries? But the way the symmetries interact enable us \u2014 we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different. And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on. Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn, then flip it. And then do it in the other order, and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables \u2014 how symmetries interact. It's almost like little Sudoku tables. You don't see any symmetry twice in any row or column. And, using those rules, he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries. And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle, or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish. I think this is an amazing development. It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry. In the front here, I've got one, two, three people sitting on one, two, three chairs. The people and the chairs are very different, but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra. Here are two very different walls, very different geometric pictures. But, using the language of Galois, we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same. For example, let's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them. You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors. But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet. What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle, and everything matches up. And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge, where I can rotate by 180 degrees. And all the tiles match up again. So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.Now, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra. And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction. So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet. And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars. And although these walls look very different, Galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same. And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.Here is another example in the Alhambra. This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor. They all look very different. But this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object, which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football, but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.Now, this power of the language is even more, because Galois can say, \"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the Alhambra?\" And it turns out they almost did. You can prove, using Galois' language, there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra. And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one, it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.But these are things that we can see. And the power of Galois' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world, beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional, all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space. And that's where I work. I create mathematical objects, symmetrical objects, using Galois' language, in very high dimensional spaces. So I think it's a great example of things unseen, which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you, and I've got a picture of it here. Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board at the side here, great, excellent. Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you a picture of this symmetrical object. But here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact.Now, this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet. Now, people like getting their names on things, on craters on the moon or new species of animals. So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before. And this thing \u2014 species die away, and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode \u2014 but this mathematical object will live forever. It will make you immortal. In order to win this symmetrical object, what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning. How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?Okay, I'm going to sort you out. Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are in that number. Okay? If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials. Okay, now if you want to play, I want you to stand up, okay? If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits, right \u2014 we've already got one competitor here. If you all stay down he wins it automatically. Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six. Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.Anybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down, because you've underestimated. Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down. 60 digits or more, you've got to sit down. You've overestimated. 20 digits or less, sit down. How many digits are there in your number? Two? So you should have sat down earlier. (Laughter) Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay? If I told you 20 or less, stand up. Because this one. I think there were a few here. The people who just last sat down.Okay, how many digits do you have in your number? (Laughs) 21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours? 18. So it goes to this lady here. 21 is the closest. It actually has \u2014 the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube has 25 digits. So now I need to name this object. So, what is your name? I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally \u2014 spell it for me. G-H-E-Z No, SO2 has already been used, actually, in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one. So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object. You are now immortal. (Applause)And if you'd like your own symmetrical object, I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala, where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you, for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala. And I think what drives me, as a mathematician, are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered. It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject. And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese \"Essays in Idleness\": \"In everything, uniformity is undesirable. Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting, and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\" Thank you.

was heard\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:21.958\n(Gunshot)\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nA peasant, who was walking to market that morning,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nran towards where the gunshot had come from,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nclearly shot by a dueling wound.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nThe young man's name was Evariste Galois.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nHe was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nGalois was taken to the local hospital\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nwhere he died the next day in the arms of his brother.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd the last words he said to his brother were,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\n\"Don't cry for me, Alfred.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nI need all the courage I can muster\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nto die at the age of 20.\"\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nIt wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nfor which Galois was famous.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nBut a few years earlier, while still at school,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nhe'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nproblems at the time.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd he wrote to the academicians in Paris,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\ntrying to explain his theory.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nBut the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThis is how he wrote most of his mathematics.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nSo, the night before that duel, he realized\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nthis possibly is his last chance\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nto try and explain his great breakthrough.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nSo he stayed up the whole night, writing away,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\ntrying to explain his ideas.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nhe left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nMaybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwas the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nBut contained inside those documents\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nwas a new language, a language to understand\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\none of the most fundamental concepts\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nof science -- namely symmetry.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nNow, symmetry is almost nature's language.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIt helps us to understand so many\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\ndifferent bits of the scientific world.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nFor example, molecular structure.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat crystals are possible,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nwe can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIn microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nbecause they are generally rather nasty.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThe swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd it uses the efficiency of symmetry\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nto be able to propagate itself so well.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBut on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nbecause it actually communicates genetic information.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nyou're probably drawn to the lower two.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nBecause it is hard to make symmetry.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthat you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand therefore you'll make a good mate.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nSo symmetry is a language which can help to communicate\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\ngenetic information.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nSymmetry can also help us to explain\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhat's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nOr what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nTo be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwe might see there,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nit seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin a higher dimensional space.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthe power of mathematics\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nto understand the scientific world around us.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nHe wrote, \"The universe cannot be read\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nuntil we have learnt the language\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand become familiar with the characters in which it is written.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nIt is written in mathematical language,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwithout which means it is humanly impossible\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nto comprehend a single word.\"\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nArtists too love to play around with symmetry.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThey also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nHere is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in \"The Magic Mountain.\"\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nHe has a character describing the snowflake,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand he says he \"shuddered at its perfect precision,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nfound it deathly, the very marrow of death.\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nBut what artists like to do is to set up expectations\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nof symmetry and then break them.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd a beautiful example of this\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nI found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nin Japan, Professor Kurokawa.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd he took me up to the temples in Nikko.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd the gateway you see behind\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nhas eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nSeven of them are exactly the same,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the eighth one is turned upside down.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd I said to Professor Kurokawa,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwhen they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.\"\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd he said, \"No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act.\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\n\"Essays in Idleness\" from the 14th century,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nin which the essayist wrote, \"In everything,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nuniformity is undesirable.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\"\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nEven when building the Imperial Palace,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthey always leave one place unfinished.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nBut if I had to choose one building in the world\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nto be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nbeing an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThis is a palace celebrating symmetry.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nRecently I took my family --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwe do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is my son Tamer. You can see\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nhe's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBut I wanted to try and enrich him.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI think one of the problems about school mathematics\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nis it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nin the world we live in.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nSo, I wanted to open his eyes up to\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nhow much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nYou see it already. Immediately you go in,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nthe reflective symmetry in the water.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nThe Moorish artists were denied the possibility\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nto draw things with souls.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo they explored a more geometric art.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd so what is symmetry?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThe Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nWhat is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ndo they have the same symmetries?\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nCan we say whether they discovered\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nall of the symmetries in the Alhambra?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd it was Galois who produced a language\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto be able to answer some of these questions.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nFor Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwhich was something still and deathly --\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nfor Galois, symmetry was all about motion.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nWhat can you do to a symmetrical object,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nmove it in some way, so it looks the same\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nas before you moved it?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nI like to describe it as the magic trick moves.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nWhat can you do to something? You close your eyes.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nI do something, put it back down again.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nIt looks like it did before it started.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo, for example, the walls in the Alhambra --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nI can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nrotate them by 90 degrees,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nput them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nBut it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\ninside the Alhambra.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nBut it's also about producing a language to describe this.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd the power of mathematics is often\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nto change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nso brace yourselves --\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\npush you a little bit to understand how this language works,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich enables us to capture what is symmetry.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nLet's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nWhat can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nWell, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand still it looks like it did before I started.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI could rotate it by a third of a turn,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nor a half a turn,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nor put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat make it look like it did before I started.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nNow, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nCan anybody think what else I could do to this\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nwhich would leave it like I did before I started?\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nIt's got no reflective symmetry.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nBut what I could do is just leave it where it is,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\npick it up, and put it down again.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nActually, the invention of the number zero\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwas a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt seems mad to talk about nothing.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nso everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, this object has six symmetries.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd what about the triangle?\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWell, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nor a third of a turn anticlockwise.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nBut now this has some reflectional symmetry.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI can reflect it in the line through X,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nor the line through Y,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nor the line through Z.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nFive symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwhere I just pick it up and leave it where it is.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nSo both of these objects have six symmetries.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nNow, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand you have to do some mathematics\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nin order to really understand it.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSo here is a little question for you.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nfor the person who gets closest to the answer.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThe Rubik's Cube.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nHow many things can I do to this object\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand put it down so it still looks like a cube?\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nOkay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nand count how many symmetries there are.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nBut let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWhat Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nbut how they interact with each other\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nwhich really characterizes the symmetry of an object.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nIf I do one magic trick move followed by another,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthe combination is a third magic trick move.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd here we see Galois starting to develop\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\na language to see the substance\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nof the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nof the symmetry underlying this physical object.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nFor example, what if I turn the starfish\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nby a sixth of a turn,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nand then a third of a turn?\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nare the names for the rotations.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nB, for example, rotates the little yellow dot\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nto the B on the starfish. And so on.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nSo what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nfollowed by C, which is a third of a turn?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWell let's do that. A sixth of a turn,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nfollowed by a third of a turn,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthe combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo the little table here records\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nhow the algebra of these symmetries work.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nI do one followed by another, the answer is\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nit's rotation D, half a turn.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nWhat I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nLet's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nOf course, it doesn't make any difference.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nIt still ends up at half a turn.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nLet's see what happens if we do two symmetries\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwith the triangle, one after the other.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nLet's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand reflect in the line through X.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWell, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nto start with.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nNow, let's do it in a different order.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nLet's do the reflection in X first,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nfollowed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIt's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nNow it matters what order you do the operations in.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAnd this enables us to distinguish\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwhy the symmetries of these objects --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthey both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nthey have the same symmetries?\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nBut the way the symmetries interact\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nenable us -- we've now got a language\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nto distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nTake a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthen flip it. And then do it in the other order,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nNow, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nIt's almost like little Sudoku tables.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nYou don't see any symmetry twice\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nin any row or column.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nAnd, using those rules, he was able to say\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthat there are in fact only two objects\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwith six symmetries.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nAnd they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nor the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nI think this is an amazing development.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nIt's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn the front here, I've got one, two, three people\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nsitting on one, two, three chairs.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe people and the chairs are very different,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbut the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nHere are two very different walls,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nvery different geometric pictures.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nBut, using the language of Galois,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwe can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nare actually the same.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nFor example, let's take this beautiful wall\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nwith the triangles with a little twist on them.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou can rotate them by a sixth of a turn\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nif you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nBut the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\naround the point where all the triangles meet.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWhat about the center of a triangle? I can rotate\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nby a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand everything matches up.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwhere I can rotate by 180 degrees.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd all the tiles match up again.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nSo rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nNow, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnd the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd although these walls look very different,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nGalois has produced a language to say\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthat in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nHere is another example in the Alhambra.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThis is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThey all look very different. But this language allows us to say\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthat they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nwhich we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nbut because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nby a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nNow, this power of the language is even more,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nbecause Galois can say,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\n\"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\non the walls in the Alhambra?\"\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd it turns out they almost did.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nYou can prove, using Galois' language,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthere are actually only 17\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\ndifferent symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nit will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nBut these are things that we can see.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd the power of Galois' mathematical language\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nis it also allows us to create\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nsymmetrical objects in the unseen world,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nbeyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nall the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd that's where I work. I create\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nmathematical objects, symmetrical objects,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nusing Galois' language,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nin very high dimensional spaces.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nSo I think it's a great example of things unseen,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nwhich the power of mathematical language allows you to create.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo, like Galois, I stayed up all last night\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\ncreating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand I've got a picture of it here.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nWell, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nat the side here, great, excellent.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nHere we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\na picture of this symmetrical object.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBut here is the language which describes\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nhow the symmetries interact.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nNow, this new symmetrical object\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ndoes not have a name yet.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nNow, people like getting their names on things,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\non craters on the moon\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nor new species of animals.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nSo I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwhich hasn't been named before.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nAnd this thing -- species die away,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nand moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nbut this mathematical object will live forever.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt will make you immortal.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nIn order to win this symmetrical object,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhat you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nHow many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nOkay, I'm going to sort you out.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nRather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nin that number. Okay?\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nIf you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nOkay, now if you want to play,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nI want you to stand up, okay?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nIf you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nright -- we've already got one competitor here.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nIf you all stay down he wins it automatically.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nOkay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nGreat. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nbecause you've underestimated.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nFive or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nYou've overestimated.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:19.958\n20 digits or less, sit down.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nHow many digits are there in your number?\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nTwo? So you should have sat down earlier.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nLet's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nIf I told you 20 or less, stand up.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nBecause this one. I think there were a few here.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nThe people who just last sat down.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nOkay, how many digits do you have in your number?\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\n(Laughs)\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\n21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\n18. So it goes to this lady here.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\n21 is the closest.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nIt actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nhas 25 digits.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo now I need to name this object.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nSo, what is your name?\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nI need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nspell it for me.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nG-H-E-Z\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNo, SO2 has already been used, actually,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nin the mathematical language. So you can't have that one.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nSo Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nYou are now immortal.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd if you'd like your own symmetrical object,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nI have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nwhere I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nfor a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nAnd I think what drives me, as a mathematician,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nare those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nIt's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nAnd I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese \"Essays in Idleness\":\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\n\"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nLeaving something incomplete makes it interesting,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nand gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.\" Thank you.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:09.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How the Internet enables intimacy", "duration": "531", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stefana_broadbent_how_the_internet_enables_intimacy", "transcript": "I believe that there are new, hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions \u2014 institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life: schools, hospitals, workplaces, factories, offices, etc. And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of \"democratization of intimacy.\" And what do I mean by that? I mean that what people are doing is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels, they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them. How are they doing this? They're doing it in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work, by IMing from their office to their friends, by texting under the desk. The pictures that you're seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months. And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most. And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father. One young woman brought her grandfather. For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc. What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally, people are communicating on a regular basis with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere. Now, lets take some data. Facebook. Recently some sociologists from Facebook \u2014 Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlargening of all channels. And an average user, said Cameron Marlow, from Facebook, has about 120 friends. But he actually talks to, has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people on a regular base, depending on his gender. Academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists, but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four \u2014 anyway, less than five. My own research on cellphones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people. 80 percent. And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people. A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed. I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people. And some sociologists actually feel that it's a closure, it's a cocooning, that we're disengaging from the public. And I would actually, I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it, and from where they're doing it, actually there is an incredible social transformation. There are three stories that I think are quite good examples. The first gentleman, he's a baker. And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning. And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven, cleans his hands from the flour and calls his wife. He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day. And I've heard this story a number of times. A young factory worker who works night shifts, who manages to sneak away from the factory floor, where there is CCTV by the way, and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight. Or a mother who, at four o'clock, suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home. Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple. They've lived in Italy for a number of years. They Skype with their families a few times a week. But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table, pull out the webcam and actually have dinner with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it. And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland. They had set up a big screen in their living room, and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother. But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist who is working on Filipina migrant women who leave their children back in the Philippines, was telling me about how much parenting is going on through Skype, and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. And then there is the third couple. They are two friends. They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually. And finally, finally, they've managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work. And now, obviously, they have it open. Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other. And this is exactly what we've been seeing with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table, and texting under the table to their friends. So, none of these cases are unique. I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them. But what is really exceptional is the setting. So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about: factory, migration, office. But it could be in a school, it could be an administration, it could be a hospital. Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years, if you just think back 15 years, when you clocked in, when you clocked in to an office, when you clocked in to a factory, there was no contact for the whole duration of the time, there was no contact with your private sphere. If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere. If you were in management, oh, that was a different story. Maybe you had a direct line. If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator. But basically, when you walked into those buildings, the private sphere was left behind you. And this has become such a norm of our professional lives, such a norm and such an expectation. And it had nothing to do with technical capability. The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand, fully to the people around you. That was where the focus had to be. And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage. If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children, to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. And then the school enacts perfectly well. It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices: rituals of entry, rituals of exit, the schedules, the uniforms in this country, things that identify you, team-building activities, team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time. And of course, the major thing: learn to pay attention, to concentrate and focus your attention. This only started about 150 years ago. It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy, and of industrial revolution. When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work. And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach, where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere. So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades. They were living on top of the land they were laboring. They were living on top of the workshops where they were working. And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture, even our cities. If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there. Now we have sprawling residential suburbias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas. And actually, over these 150 years, there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged. So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out, the more removed he would be from his personal sphere. People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations. And they are doing it massively. The Pew Institute, which produces good data on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States, says that \u2014 and I think that this number is conservative \u2014 50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office. I really think that the number is conservative. In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country. 75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones. 100 percent are using text. The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions. I'm always surprised the U.S. Army sociologists are discussing of the impact for instance, of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families. But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access. And every day, every single day, I read news that makes me cringe, like a $15 fine to kids in Texas, for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school. Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York, if seen with a mobile phone in a hand. Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. Behind issues of security and safety, which have always been the arguments for social control, in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention, to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated. And they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense, this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.", "id": 680, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI believe that there are new, hidden tensions\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nthat are actually happening between people and institutions --\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\ninstitutions that are the institutions that people\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:22.958\ninhabit in their daily life:\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nschools, hospitals, workplaces,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nfactories, offices, etc.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd something that I see happening\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nis something that I would like to call\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\na sort of \"democratization of intimacy.\"\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd what do I mean by that?\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI mean that what people are doing\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nis, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nthey are breaking an imposed isolation\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nthat these institutions are imposing on them.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nHow are they doing this? They're doing it\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nin a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nby IMing from their office to their friends,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nby texting under the desk.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nThe pictures that you're seeing behind me\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nare people that I visited in the last few months.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nOne young woman brought her grandfather.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nFor 20 years, I've been looking at how people use\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nchannels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nWhat we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\npeople are communicating on a regular basis\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwith five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nNow, lets take some data. Facebook.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nRecently some sociologists from Facebook --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nFacebook is the channel that you would expect\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nis the most enlargening of all channels.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd an average user,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nsaid Cameron Marlow,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nfrom Facebook, has about 120 friends.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nBut he actually talks to,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhas two-way exchanges with, about four to six people\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\non a regular base, depending on his gender.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAcademic research on instant messaging\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nalso shows 100 people on buddy lists,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nbut fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nanyway, less than five.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nMy own research on cellphones and voice calls\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nshows that 80 percent of the calls\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nare actually made to four people. 80 percent.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nA lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nI mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwhen I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd some sociologists actually feel that\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nit's a closure, it's a cocooning,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat we're disengaging from the public.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd I would actually, I would like to show you that\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nif we actually look at who is doing it,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand from where they're doing it,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nactually there is an incredible social transformation.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThere are three stories that I think are quite good examples.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe first gentleman, he's a baker.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\ncleans his hands from the flour\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nand calls his wife.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nHe just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd I've heard this story a number of times.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nA young factory worker who works night shifts,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nwho manages to sneak away from the factory floor,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nwhere there is CCTV by the way,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nhe can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nOr a mother who, at four o'clock,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nsuddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto check that her children are safely home.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThen there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThey've lived in Italy for a number of years.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThey Skype with their families a few times a week.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nBut once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\npull out the webcam and actually have dinner\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nwith their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nfrom a very modest family\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nof immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThey had set up a big screen in their living room,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nBut Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nwho is working on Filipina migrant women\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwho leave their children back in the Philippines,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nwas telling me about how much parenting is going on\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthrough Skype,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nand how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd then there is the third couple. They are two friends.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThey chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd finally, finally, they've managed to put\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\ninstant messaging on their computers at work.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd now, obviously, they have it open.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWhenever they have a moment they chat to each other.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this is exactly what we've been seeing\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwith teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand texting under the table to their friends.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo, none of these cases are unique.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nBut what is really exceptional is the setting.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nSo, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfactory, migration, office.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nBut it could be in a school, it could be an administration,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nit could be a hospital.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThree settings that, if we just step back 15 years,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nif you just think back 15 years,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwhen you clocked in,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhen you clocked in to an office,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwhen you clocked in to a factory,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthere was no contact for the whole duration of the time,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthere was no contact with your private sphere.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIf you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nIf you were in management, oh, that was a different story.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nMaybe you had a direct line.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nIf you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nBut basically, when you walked into those buildings,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthe private sphere was left behind you.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd this has become such a norm of our professional lives,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nsuch a norm and such an expectation.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd it had nothing to do with technical capability.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThe phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nyour commitment was fully to the task at hand,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nfully to the people around you.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThat was where the focus had to be.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd this has become such a cultural norm\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIf you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nare just dedicated to take away the children,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto make them used to staying long hours away from their family.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd then the school enacts perfectly well.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nrituals of entry, rituals of exit,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthe schedules, the uniforms in this country,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthings that identify you, team-building activities,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nteam building that will allow you to basically\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nbe with a random group of kids, or a random group of people\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat you will have to be with for a number of time.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd of course, the major thing:\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nlearn to pay attention,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto concentrate and focus your attention.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThis only started about 150 years ago.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nIt only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand of industrial revolution.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWhen people basically had to go somewhere else to work\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand carry out the work.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhere there was a clear distinction between the private sphere\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand the public sphere.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nSo, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThey were living on top of the land they were laboring.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThey were living on top of the workshops where they were working.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\neven our cities.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nIf you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nall have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nNow we have sprawling residential suburbias\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthat are well distinct from production areas\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand commercial areas.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd actually, over these 150 years,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthere has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo the lower the status of the job\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nand of the person carrying out, the more removed\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nhe would be from his personal sphere.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nPeople have taken this amazing possibility\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nof actually being in contact all through the day\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nor in all types of situations.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd they are doing it massively.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThe Pew Institute, which produces good data\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\non a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nsays that -- and I think that this number is conservative --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n50 percent of anybody with email access at work\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nis actually doing private email from his office.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nI really think that the number is conservative.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIn my own research, we saw that the peak for private email\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nis actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\n75 percent of people admit doing private\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nconversations from work on their mobile phones.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\n100 percent are using text.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThe point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nis not terribly successful with all institutions.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI'm always surprised the U.S. Army\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nsociologists are discussing of the impact\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfor instance, of soldiers in Iraq\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nhaving daily contact with their families.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nBut there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd every day, every single day,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI read news that makes me cringe,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nlike a $15

In 2006, young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps. And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled. Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker. 1.1 million of them. Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home. They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there. And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water, no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities, 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector, and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable. Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged, but the numbers are simply overwhelming. In August 2008, UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations. And last summer, more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages, for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.And then the financial collapse happened. When the contractors have gone bust, as they've been overleveraged like everyone else, the difference is everything goes missing, documentation, passports, and tickets home for these workers. Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned. There is no way back home. And there is no way, and no proof of arrival. These are the boom-and-bust refugees.The question is, as a building professional, as an architect, an engineer, as a developer, if you know this is going on, as we go to the sights every single week, are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations? So let's forget your environmental footprint. Let's think about your ethical footprint. What good is it to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex, when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best? Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road. But, quite frankly, on this issue, there is no other road.So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse. And that as we worry about our next job in the office, the next design that we can get, to keep our workers. Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work. Thank you.

Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change; and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog. They're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.Recently, the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system. That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries. They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic, and all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers from 113 countries. It's a big community; such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that. Every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics. For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Ni\u00f1o Oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study.And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules. And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it. The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion \u2014 10 to the 21st \u2014 molecules of isoprene.But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet. It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane. And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing. We blow it up and look at the pieces. This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain. Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car. But still, we look at the pieces.We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do. Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales. It takes weeks to perform our integrations, and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.We also fly all over the world looking for this thing. I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia \u2014 there are others. We found a global atmospheric watchtower there in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene and other things while we were there. This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above, and the tower from below.On part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us. And this plane, the model BAe-146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people, so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today. But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule \u2014 incredibly dangerous stuff.We have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements; we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering; we need special flight clearance. As you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs; the scientists must be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while on board. So as you can imagine, the inside of the aircraft doesn't look like one you'd take on vacation. It's a flying laboratory we took to make measurements of this molecule.We do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule. And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject. And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.As a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection, of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others. And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections. So you can imagine the scale of the effort. In each one of the assessments we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience. And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers in order to make headlines like these.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 682, "subtitle":

And I worked in mines. And I realized that this was a world unseen. And I wanted, through color and large format cameras and very large prints, to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape, how we use the land. And to me this was a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography, which allows us to contemplate these landscapes, that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work.And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes, it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed. Because that is what has changed, is the speed at which we're taking all our resources. And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground, refinement. And that's one chapter.The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it \u2014 our cities, our cars, our motorcultures, where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration. And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end, where all of our parts of cars, our tires, oil filters, helicopters, planes \u2014 where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?And to me, again, photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world, and find those places. And another idea that I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist \u2014 he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material? It was 23 metric tons for one liter. So whenever I fill up my gas, I think of that liter, and how much carbon.And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton, but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy. From the photosynthetic growth, it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society. Looking at 30 billion per year, we look at our two largest suppliers, Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil. And together they only form about 15 years of supply. The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves, only gives us about 45 years. So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when peak oil will come upon us.So, to me, using photography \u2014 and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents, our ways of thinking, to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time, how to deal with our energy crisis.And I would like to say that, on the other side of it, 30, 40 years from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, \"We did everything we possibly, humanly could do, to begin to mitigate this, what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time.

Well, you probably recognize the first person. I'm sure you're all avid \"American Idol\" watchers. But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the Poet of the Millions competition, which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi, and seen throughout the Arab world. In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry, which is the traditional Bedouin form. And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition.Now, before I go any further, yes, I know it all began with \"Britain's Got Talent.\" But my point in discussing this is to show you \u2014 I hope I'll be able to show you how these merit-based competitions, with equal access to everyone, with the winner selected via voting by SMS, are changing tribal societies. And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE, how they're changing tribal societies, not by introducing Western ideas, but by being integrated into the language in those places.It all begins with enjoyment. Video: We are late to watch \"Afghan Star.\" We are going to watch \"Afghan Star.\" We are late. We are running late. We must go to watch \"Afghan Star.\" Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society. In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program. And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set. People watch it all over the country also in public places. But it goes beyond watching, because also, part of this is campaigning. People become so engaged that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate. Contestants also put themselves forward.Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely. Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group. This has opened up the door, particularly for women. And in the last season there were two women in the finalists. One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar, a very conservative part of the country. And here she relates, in the documentary film \"Afghan Star,\" how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy. But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out, to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition. I have to say, her husband backed her from the start. But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it. But, once she started to win, then they got behind her again. It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value. And she's out there. Her poetry is about women, and the life of women in society. So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men \u2014 this shows the voting on the program \u2014 it sets a very important example for young women \u2014 these are young women in the audience of the program \u2014 in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.Now you'd think that \"American Idol\" would introduce a measure of Americanization. But actually, just the opposite is happening. By using this engaging popular format for traditional, local culture, it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry, also in traditional dress and dance and music. And for Afghanistan, where the Taliban banned music for many years, it is reintroducing their traditional music. They don't sing pop songs, they sing Afghan music. And they also have learned how to lose gracefully, without avenging the winner. (Laughter) No small thing.And the final, sort of, formulation of this \"American Idol\" format, which has just appeared in Afghanistan, is a new program called \"The Candidate.\" And in this program, people present policy platforms that are then voted on. Many of them are too young to run for president, but by putting the issues out there, they are influencing the presidential race. So for me, the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality. Thank you.

00:02:49.958\nAnd in the last season there were two women in the finalists.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nOne of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\na very conservative part of the country.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd here she relates, in the documentary film \"Afghan Star,\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nhow her friends urged her not to do this\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nand told her that she was leaving them for democracy.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nBut she also confides that\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nshe knows that members of the Taliban\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nare actually SMS-ing votes in for her.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAydah Al Jahnani also took risks\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand put herself out, to compete\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nin the Poet of the Millions competition.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI have to say, her husband backed her from the start.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nBut her tribe and family urged her not to compete\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand were very much against it.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBut, once she started to win,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthen they got behind her again.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nIt turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd she's out there.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHer poetry is about women,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand the life of women in society.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo just by presenting herself\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand being in competition with men --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthis shows the voting on the program --\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nit sets a very important example for young women --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthese are young women in the audience of the program --\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nin Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nNow you'd think that \"American Idol\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwould introduce a measure of Americanization.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut actually, just the opposite is happening.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nBy using this engaging popular format\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nfor traditional, local culture,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nit actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nof interest in Nabati poetry,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nalso in traditional dress and dance and music.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd for Afghanistan,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwhere the Taliban banned music for many years,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nit is reintroducing their traditional music.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThey don't sing pop songs,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthey sing Afghan music.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd they also have learned how to lose gracefully,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwithout avenging the winner.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nNo small thing.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nAnd the final, sort of, formulation\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nof this \"American Idol\" format,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nwhich has just appeared in Afghanistan,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nis a new program called \"The Candidate.\"\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd in this program, people present\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\npolicy platforms that are then voted on.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nMany of them are too young to run for president,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbut by putting the issues out there,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthey are influencing the presidential race.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nSo for me, the substance of things unseen\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nis how reality TV is driving reality.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThank you.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology", "duration": "830", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/pranav_mistry_the_thrilling_potential_of_sixthsense_technology", "transcript": "We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use. When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects, but we also use them to interact with each other. A gesture of \"Namaste!\", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe, in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means \"four runs\" in cricket. It comes as a part of our everyday learning.So, I am very interested, from the beginning, how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world. Rather than using a keyboard and mouse, why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world?So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it. Most of you might be aware that, in those days, the mouse used to come with a ball inside, and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving, and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving. So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend \u2014 never returned to him \u2014 and I now had four rollers. Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is, basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line. It had some strings and pulleys and some springs. What I got is basically a gesture-interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars. So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000.Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds, I thought of sticky notes. I thought, \"Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?\" A message written on a sticky note to my mom, on paper, can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar \u2014 a to-do list that automatically syncs with you. But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, \"What is Dr. Smith's address?\" and this small system actually prints it out \u2014 so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper.In another exploration, I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions. So, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions, but they can actually draw, so that it's more intuitive to use that way.Then I thought, \"Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?\" Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it. If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is. A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup.So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly. Among all these experiments, there was one thing in common: I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world. I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive.But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing. What we are interested in is information. We want to know about things. We want to know about dynamic things going around.So I thought, around last year \u2014 in the beginning of the last year \u2014 I started thinking, \"Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?\" Maybe, \"How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?\" Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels?So, in order to realize this dream, I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head. I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it? I took it very literally, and took my bike helmet, put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely. So now, what I can do \u2014 I can augment the world around me with this digital information.But later, I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also. So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye. Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go. You can start using any surface, any wall around you, as an interface. The camera is actually tracking all your gestures. Whatever you're doing with your hands, it's understanding that gesture. And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. You can start painting on any wall. You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall. But we are not only tracking one finger, here. We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. The camera is actually doing \u2014 just, getting all the images \u2014 is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside. So, technically, it's a little bit complex, but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense.But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside. Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket, you can just do the gesture of taking a photo, and it takes a photo for you.(Applause)Thank you. And later I can find a wall, anywhere, and start browsing those photos or maybe, \"OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend.\" So, we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world. And, of course, if you don't have any surface, you can start using your palm for simple operations. Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements, but, interestingly, is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.For example, in this case, the book cover is matched with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online, and checking out which book it is. Once it has that information, it finds out more reviews about that, or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that, so you can actually hear, on a physical book, a review as sound.(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University \u2014This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.(Video) And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT \u2014Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk, outside, on just a newspaper. Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated. You have to check your computer in order to do that, right?(Applause)When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon. And I think this technology will not only change the way \u2014(Laughter)Yes. It will change the way we interact with people, also, not only the physical world. The fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro, and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right?(Laughter)And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life.But many of you argue, actually, that all of our work is not only about physical objects. We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things; what about that? And many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers to come out in the market.So, rather than waiting for that, I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper. So, what I did here is remove the camera \u2014 All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera. I removed the microphone from that, and then just pinched that \u2014 like I just made a clip out of the microphone \u2014 and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around. So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper. But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.You can of course watch movies.(Video) Good afternoon. My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54.\"PM: And you can of course play games.(Car engine)Here, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game.(Applause)Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse. Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it. So, more interestingly, I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way. When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer.(Applause)And why only computers? We can just play with papers. Paper world is interesting to play with. Here, I'm taking a part of a document, and putting over here a second part from a second place, and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there. Yeah. And I say, \"OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing.\" So I now have a print-out of that thing. So the workflow is more intuitive, the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back, rather than now switching between these two worlds.So, as a last thought, I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide, the gap between these two worlds, but will also help us, in some way, to stay human, to be more connected to our physical world. And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines.That's all. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius. This is incredible, really. What are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned? Or is this research forever, or what?Pranav Mistry: So, there are lots of companies, sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way. Companies like mobile-phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India, thinking, \"Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'? We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak. This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system.\"CA: What are your own plans? Are you staying at MIT, or are you going to do something with this?PM: I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device, because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own. We will provide all the open source software for them, maybe starting next month.CA: Open source? Wow.(Applause)CA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point?PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.CA: What are your plans? MIT? India? How are you going to split your time going forward?PM: There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning. All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India. And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness: this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that. Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000? I showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time, and then he said, \"OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that.\" So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.(Applause)CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED, I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. It's an honor to have you at TED. Thank you so much. That's fantastic.(Applause)", "id": 685, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.934\nWe grew up\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

actually acts like a paper\ninput-output system,\n\n00:02:56.674 --> 00:02:59.459\njust made out of paper.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.934\nIn another exploration,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.934\nI thought of making a pen\nthat can draw in three dimensions.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.934\nSo, I implemented this pen\nthat can help designers and architects\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.934\nnot only think in three dimensions,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.934\nbut they can actually draw,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.006\nso that it's more intuitive\nto use that way.\n\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.078\nThen I thought,\n\"Why not make a Google Map,\n\n00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:20.934\nbut in the physical world?\"\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.934\nRather than typing a keyword\nto find something,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.934\nI put my objects on top of it.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.149\nIf I put a boarding pass, it will show me\nwhere the flight gate is.\n\n00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:31.934\nA coffee cup will show\nwhere you can find more coffee,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.934\nor where you can trash the cup.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.934\nSo, these were some\nof the earlier explorations I did\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbecause the goal was to connect\nthese two worlds seamlessly.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.934\nAmong all these experiments,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.934\nthere was one thing in common:\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.463\nI was trying to bring\na part of the physical world\n\n00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:49.985\nto the digital world.\n\n00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:51.934\nI was taking some part of the objects,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.935\nor any of the intuitiveness of real life,\n\n00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.148\nand bringing them to the digital world,\n\n00:03:57.172 --> 00:04:01.197\nbecause the goal was to make\nour computing interfaces more intuitive.\n\n00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:05.934\nBut then I realized that we humans\nare not actually interested in computing.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.934\nWhat we are interested in is information.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.934\nWe want to know about things.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.339\nWe want to know about\ndynamic things going around.\n\n00:04:13.363 --> 00:04:17.934\nSo I thought, around last year --\nin the beginning of the last year --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.435\nI started thinking, \"Why can I not take\nthis approach in the reverse way?\"\n\n00:04:22.077 --> 00:04:24.134\nMaybe, \"How about I take my digital world\n\n00:04:24.158 --> 00:04:28.934\nand paint the physical world\nwith that digital information?\"\n\n00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:33.734\nBecause pixels are actually, right now,\nconfined in these rectangular devices\n\n00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:35.505\nthat fit in our pockets.\n\n00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.934\nWhy can I not remove this confine\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.934\nand take that to my everyday\nobjects, everyday life\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.101\nso that I don't need\nto learn the new language\n\n00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.922\nfor interacting with those pixels?\n\n00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:48.934\nSo, in order to realize this dream,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.934\nI actually thought of putting\na big-size projector on my head.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.197\nI think that's why this is called\na head-mounted projector, isn't it?\n\n00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:56.934\nI took it very literally,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.934\nand took my bike helmet,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.339\nput a little cut over there so that\nthe projector actually fits nicely.\n\n00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:03.934\nSo now, what I can do --\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.763\nI can augment the world around me\nwith this digital information.\n\n00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:09.834\nBut later,\n\n00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.017\nI realized that I actually\nwanted to interact\n\n00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.634\nwith those digital pixels, also.\n\n00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.934\nSo I put a small camera over there\nthat acts as a digital eye.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.934\nLater, we moved to a much better,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nconsumer-oriented pendant version of that,\n\n00:05:20.982 --> 00:05:23.934\nthat many of you now know\nas the SixthSense device.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.934\nBut the most interesting thing\nabout this particular technology\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.934\nis that you can carry\nyour digital world with you\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.934\nwherever you go.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.934\nYou can start using any surface,\nany wall around you,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.934\nas an interface.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.934\nThe camera is actually tracking\nall your gestures.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.934\nWhatever you're doing with your hands,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.934\nit's understanding that gesture.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.534\nAnd, actually, if you see,\nthere are some color markers\n\n00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:50.034\nthat in the beginning version\nwe are using with it.\n\n00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.934\nYou can start painting on any wall.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.934\nYou stop by a wall,\nand start painting on that wall.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.101\nBut we are not only tracking\none finger, here.\n\n00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.934\nWe are giving you the freedom\nof using all of both of your hands,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.101\nso you can actually use both of your hands\nto zoom into or zoom out\n\n00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.101\nof a map just by pinching all present.\n\n00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:09.934\nThe camera is actually doing --\njust, getting all the images --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.934\nis doing the edge recognition\nand also the color recognition\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.934\nand so many other small algorithms\nare going on inside.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nSo, technically,\nit's a little bit complex,\n\n00:06:17.982 --> 00:06:21.458\nbut it gives you an output which is more\nintuitive to use, in some sense.\n\n00:06:21.482 --> 00:06:24.334\nBut I'm more excited that you can\nactually take it outside.\n\n00:06:24.358 --> 00:06:26.934\nRather than getting your camera\nout of your pocket,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.934\nyou can just do the gesture\nof taking a photo,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.934\nand it takes a photo for you.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThank you.\n\n00:06:37.557 --> 00:06:39.934\nAnd later I can find a wall, anywhere,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.934\nand start browsing those photos\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.634\nor maybe, \"OK, I want to modify\nthis photo a little bit\n\n00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:46.644\nand send it as an email to a friend.\"\n\n00:06:46.668 --> 00:06:48.934\nSo, we are looking for an era\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.934\nwhere computing will actually merge\nwith the physical world.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.934\nAnd, of course,\nif you don't have any surface,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nyou can start using your palm\nfor simple operations.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.435\nHere, I'm dialing a phone number\njust using my hand.\n\n00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:06.934\nThe camera is actually not\nonly understanding your hand movements,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.134\nbut, interestingly,\n\n00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:11.397\nis also able to understand what objects\nyou are holding in your hand.\n\n00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:15.934\nFor example, in this case,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.934\nthe book cover is matched\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.934\nwith so many thousands,\nor maybe millions of books online,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.934\nand checking out which book it is.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.434\nOnce it has that information,\n\n00:07:24.458 --> 00:07:26.334\nit finds out more reviews about that,\n\n00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:28.934\nor maybe New York Times\nhas a sound overview on that,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.054\nso you can actually hear,\non a physical book,\n\n00:07:31.078 --> 00:07:32.934\na review as sound.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.134\n(Video) Famous talk\nat Harvard University --\n\n00:07:35.158 --> 00:07:38.934\nThis was Obama's visit last week to MIT.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.423\n(Video) And particularly I want\nto thank two outstanding MIT --\n\n00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:45.481\nPranav Mistry: So, I was seeing\nthe live [video] of his talk,\n\n00:07:45.505 --> 00:07:47.447\noutside, on just a newspaper.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.934\nYour newspaper will show you\nlive weather information\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.564\nrather than having it updated.\n\n00:07:53.588 --> 00:07:56.435\nYou have to check your computer\nin order to do that, right?\n\n00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:00.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.934\nWhen I'm going back,\nI can just use my boarding pass\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.054\nto check how much my flight\nhas been delayed,\n\n00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:07.934\nbecause at that particular time,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.934\nI'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.934\nand checking out a particular icon.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.092\nAnd I think this technology\nwill not only change the way --\n\n00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:16.092\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:16.116 --> 00:08:17.134\nYes.\n\n00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:19.636\nIt will change the way\nwe interact with people, also,\n\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.175\nnot only the physical world.\n\n00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.934\nThe fun part is, I'm going\nto the Boston metro,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.934\nand playing a pong game inside the train\non the ground, right?\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.034\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:30.058 --> 00:08:32.154\nAnd I think the imagination\nis the only limit\n\n00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.934\nof what you can think of\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.434\nwhen this kind of technology\nmerges with real life.\n\n00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:38.334\nBut many of you argue, actually,\n\n00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:41.034\nthat all of our work is not\nonly about physical objects.\n\n00:08:41.058 --> 00:08:44.034\nWe actually do lots\nof accounting and paper editing\n\n00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:46.349\nand all those kinds of things;\nwhat about that?\n\n00:08:46.373 --> 00:08:49.934\nAnd many of you are excited\nabout the next-generation tablet computers\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.934\nto come out in the market.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.934\nSo, rather than waiting for that,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.934\nI actually made my own,\njust using a piece of paper.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nSo, what I did here\nis remove the camera --\n\n00:08:58.982 --> 00:09:02.934\nAll the webcam cameras have\na microphone inside the camera.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.934\nI removed the microphone from that,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.934\nand then just pinched that --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.934\nlike I just made a clip\nout of the microphone --\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.934\nand clipped that to a piece of paper,\nany paper that you found around.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.934\nSo now the sound of the touch\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.934\nis getting me when exactly\nI'm touching the paper.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.934\nBut the camera is actually tracking\nwhere my fingers are moving.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.934\nYou can of course watch movies.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.934\n(Video) Good afternoon.\nMy name is Russell,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.934\nand I am a Wilderness\nExplorer in Tribe 54.\"\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.934\nPM: And you can of course play games.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.934\n(Car engine)\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.292\nHere, the camera is actually understanding\nhow you're holding the paper\n\n00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.934\nand playing a car-racing game.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:49.354 --> 00:09:52.132\nMany of you already must have\nthought, OK, you can browse.\n\n00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:54.434\nYeah. Of course you can\nbrowse to any websites\n\n00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:57.134\nor you can do all sorts\nof computing on a piece of paper\n\n00:09:57.158 --> 00:09:58.334\nwherever you need it.\n\n00:09:58.358 --> 00:10:00.934\nSo, more interestingly,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.934\nI'm interested in how we can\ntake that in a more dynamic way.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.934\nWhen I come back to my desk,\nI can just pinch that information\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.934\nback to my desktop\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.934\nso I can use my full-size computer.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.934\nAnd why only computers?\nWe can just play with papers.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.934\nPaper world is interesting to play with.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.934\nHere, I'm taking a part of a document,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.934\nand putting over here a second part\nfrom a second place,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.934\nand I'm actually modifying the information\nthat I have over there.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.934\nYeah. And I say, \"OK, this looks nice,\nlet me print it out, that thing.\"\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.339\nSo I now have a print-out of that thing.\n\n00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:40.687\nSo the workflow is more intuitive,\n\n00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:43.934\nthe way we used to do it\nmaybe 20 years back,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.934\nrather than now switching\nbetween these two worlds.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.934\nSo, as a last thought,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.334\nI think that integrating\ninformation to everyday objects\n\n00:10:54.358 --> 00:10:57.934\nwill not only help us to get rid\nof the digital divide,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.934\nthe gap between these two worlds,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.934\nbut will also help us, in some way,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.934\nto stay human,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nto be more connected\nto our physical world.\n\n00:11:10.366 --> 00:11:12.934\nAnd it will actually help us\nnot end up being machines\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.676\nsitting in front of other machines.\n\n00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:17.934\nThat's all.

Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research. He named it homunculus. Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain. So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak. It's you. It's me. It's our invisible reality. This visualization could explain, for example, why newborns, or smokers, put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth. Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs.So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely, for my design I essentially refer to it. I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being, its way of working, its way of feeling. And it really helps me to understand how we see, how we hear, how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us. It's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs.Marketing people have never been able to do that. Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies. Marketing creates user groups. And scientists, amidst complexity, amidst fluctuation and uniqueness. What could be our real needs? Maybe the silence. In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds. And you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state, and prevent us from being quiet and focused. So I wanted to create a kind of sound filter, able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution. But I didn't want it to make it by isolating people, without any earmuffs or those kind of things. Or neither with including complex technology. I just wanted to, using the complexity and the technology of the brain, of the human brain.So I worked with white noise. dB is basically \u2014 dB is the name of the product, basically a white noise diffuser. This is white noise. The white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being, brought to the same intensity. And this noise is like a \"shhhhhhhhhhhhh,\" like that. And this noise is the most neutral. It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain. So when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter, preserved from noise pollution. And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it. And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound. It seems to be magic. But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain. And in mine, I hope.So in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive, I create a ball, a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from, and roll, at home or at work, towards aggressive noise, and emits white noise in order to neutralize it. (Laughter) It works. You feel the effect of the white noise? It's too in silence. If you make some noise you can feel the effect.So even if this object, even if this product includes some technology, it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones and some electronic devices, this object is not a very smart object. And I don't want to make a very smart object. I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot. I want to create an object like you and me. So, definitely not perfect. So imagine, for instance, you are at home. A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend. You shout. You say, \"Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?\" And dB will probably roll toward you. And turning around you is \"shhhhhhh,\" like that. (Laughter) Definitely not perfect. So you would probably shut it, at this point. (Laughter)Anyway, in this same kind of approach, I designed K. K is a daylight receiver transmitter. So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk, or on your piano, where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day. And this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day, and able to give you the quantity of light you need. This object is completely covered by fiber opticals. And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure, but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object. I want, by this design feel, when you see it, you see, instinctively, this object seems to be very sensitive, very reactive. And this object knows, better than you and probably before you, what you really need. You have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy, or problem of libido. So, a huge problem. (Laughter)Most of the projects I work on \u2014 I live in collaboration with scientists. I'm just a designer. So I need them. So there can be some biologists, psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on. And I submit them, my intuitions, my hypothesis, my first ideas. And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible. And together we improve the original concept. And we build the project to the end. And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when I was at school.Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry. And the irony for me was of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress. I just do that to make money. Anyway, this project, or this experience, make me start a new project on the design of medicine. You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly. So even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry, target of stability, the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable. So we took too many of them. We took irregular dosage. We do not follow instructions. And so on.So I wanted to create a new kind of medicine, in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment. So I turned traditional pills into this. I'm going to give you some example. This one is an antibiotic. And its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment. And the concept is to create a kind of onion, a kind of structure in layers. So, you start with the darkest one. And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment. And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection. So the first day, this is the big one. And you have to peel and eat one layer a day. And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer. And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day. And you follow the treatment like that, to the end of the treatment. And here you can get the white core. And it means, right, you are in the recovery. (Applause) Thank you.This one is a \"third lung,\" a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment. I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment. So the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency. But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient. This is, the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him. So the idea is, all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself, including air and molecules, for sure. And when the kids wake up, he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth, and breathe the air it contains. So by this way, the kid, to take care of himself, is to take care of this living object. And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment, as the asthma treatment needs him. (Applause)In this guise of living object approach, I like the idea of a kind of invisible design, as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves. We could talk about a kind of soul, of a ghost accompanying them. And almost a kind of poltergeist effect. So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive, because it is \u2014 woosh \u2014 starting to move.And I remember an exhibition design I made for John Maeda, and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris. And John Maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition. And my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game, like this one. And the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room. So the living benches would be exactly like the ball. And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, \"Okay let's go.\" I remember the day of the opening. I was a little bit late. When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room, John was just beside me, and was like, \"Hmm. Hmm.\" And he told me, after a long silence, \"I wonder, Mathieu, if people won't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos.\" (Laughter) It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me, if he hadn't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening. So, huge tragedy.I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you that Pinocchio is one of my great influences. Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one. Because it is a kind of object with a conscience, able to be modified by its surroundings, and able to modify it as well. The other great influence is the mine's canary. In coal mines, this canary was supposed to be close to the miners. And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died. So this canary was a living alarm, and a very efficient one. A very natural technology, in order to say to the miners, \"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.\" So it's, for me, a great product.And I tried to design a kind of canary. Andrea is one. Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air, contaminated indoor air. So it uses some plants to do this job, selected for their gas-filtering ability. You have to know, or you probably already know, that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one. So while I'm talking to you, the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter) So you are currently breathing formaldehyde. It's the same for me with the carpet. And this is exactly the same at home. Because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they're made of.So let's have a look at your home. So your sofa, your plastic chair, your kid's toys give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic. This is the reason why I created, with David Edward, a scientist of Harvard University, an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants. But the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants. Because the roots of the plant are not very effective. Bill Wolverton from NASA analyzed it cleverly in the '70s. So the idea is to create an object able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant. So this is the final object. It will be launched next September. (Applause)This one is kind of the same approach because I include, in a product like Andrea, some plants. And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability. And it includes some fishes as well. But here, unlike Andrea, here are supposed to be eaten. Indeed, this object is a domestic farm, for fishes and green. So the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food. The locavores used to get food taken in a radius of 100 miles. Local River is able to provide you food directly in your living room. So the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics. And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish, by a water pump, feeds the plants above. And the plants will filter, by the roots, the dirty water of the fish. After, it goes back into the fish tank.After that you have two options. Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set. Amazing channel. Or you start fishing. And you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above. Because you can grow some potatoes. No, not potatoes, but tomatoes, aromatic plants and so on.So now we can breathe safely. Now we can eat local food. Now we can be treated by smart medicine. Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm with daylight. But it was important to create a perfect place, so I tried to, in order to work and create. So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris, a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office. I wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play, and where your body and your brain can work together.So, in this office, you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician. Your seat, your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather. See, like this one? In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper, but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave, like a prehistoric scientist. So you, like that, can make some sport during your work. In this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature. You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office. You can see it there.This is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office. It really helped me to design it. I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid. (Laughter) Just for my workshop. I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was. But it's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are. All of us need to be considered according to our real nature. Thank you very much.

Marketing simplifies.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nMarketing creates user groups.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd scientists, amidst complexity,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\namidst fluctuation and uniqueness.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nWhat could be our real needs?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nMaybe the silence.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nIn our daily life we are continuously disturbed by\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\naggressive sounds.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd you know all those kind of sound puts us\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nin a kind of stressful state,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand prevent us from being quiet and focused.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo I wanted to create a kind of\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nsound filter,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nable to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nBut I didn't want it to make it by\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nisolating people, without any earmuffs\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nor those kind of things.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nOr neither with including complex technology.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI just wanted to, using the complexity\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand the technology of the brain, of the human brain.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo I worked with white noise.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ndB is basically --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\ndB is the name of the product,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nbasically a white noise diffuser.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThis is white noise.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe white noise is the sum of all frequencies\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthat are audible by the human being,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbrought to the same intensity.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd this noise is like a \"shhhhhhhhhhhhh,\" like that.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd this noise is the most neutral.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSo when you hear this sound\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nyou feel like a kind of shelter,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\npreserved from noise pollution.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIt seems to be magic.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nBut it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd in mine, I hope.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSo in order to make this white noise\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\na little bit active and reactive,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI create a ball, a rolling ball\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nable to analyze and find\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwhere does aggressive sound come from,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand roll, at home or at work,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\ntowards aggressive noise,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nand emits white noise in order to neutralize it.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt works.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nYou feel the effect of the white noise?\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt's too in silence.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nIf you make some noise you can feel the effect.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo even if this object,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\neven if this product includes some technology,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nit includes some speakers, it includes some microphones\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand some electronic devices,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthis object is not a very smart object.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd I don't want to make a very smart object.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nI don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI want to create an object like you and me.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nSo, definitely not perfect.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nSo imagine, for instance, you are at home.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nA loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nYou shout. You say, \"Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?\"\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd dB will probably roll toward you.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnd turning around you is \"shhhhhhh,\" like that.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nDefinitely not perfect. So you would probably\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nshut it, at this point.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnyway, in this same kind of approach,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nI designed K.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nK is a daylight receiver transmitter.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nor on your piano, where you are supposed\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nto spend most of your time in the day.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd this object will be\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nable to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand able to give you the quantity of light you need.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThis object is completely covered by\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfiber opticals.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nbut creates the idea of an\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\neye sensibility of the object.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nI want, by this design\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nfeel, when you see it,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nyou see, instinctively,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthis object seems to be very sensitive,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nvery reactive.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd this object knows, better than you\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nand probably before you, what you really need.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nYou have to know that the lack of daylight\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\ncan provoke some\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nproblem of energy, or problem of libido.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nSo, a huge problem.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nMost of the projects I work on --\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nI live in collaboration with scientists.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nI'm just a designer. So I need them.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo there can be some biologists,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\npsychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd I submit them, my intuitions,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nmy hypothesis, my first ideas.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nAnd they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd together we improve the original concept.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd we build the project to the end.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd this kind of relationship between designer and scientist\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nstarted when I was at school.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nIndeed in my studies I was a guinea pig\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nfor a pharmaceutical industry.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd the irony for me was\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nof course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nI just do that to make money.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnyway, this project, or this experience,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nmake me start a new project on the design of medicine.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nYou have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nis not taken correctly.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo even if the active constituents\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nin pharmaceuticals made constant progress\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nin terms of chemistry, target of stability,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthe behavior of the patients\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\ngoes more and more unstable.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nSo we took too many of them.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWe took irregular dosage.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nWe do not follow instructions. And so on.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo I wanted to create a\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nnew kind of medicine,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin order to create a new kind of relationship\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbetween the patient and the treatment.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nSo I turned traditional pills into this.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nI'm going to give you some example.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nThis one is an antibiotic.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd its purpose is to help patient\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nto go to the end of the treatment.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd the concept is to\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\ncreate a kind of onion,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\na kind of structure in layers.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, you start with the darkest one.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo the first day, this is the big one.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd you have to peel and eat one layer a day.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAnd you follow the treatment like that,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto the end of the treatment.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd here you can get the white core.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd it means, right, you are in the recovery.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\n(Applause) Thank you.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThis one is a \"third lung,\"\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\na pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo the idea of this one is to create\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\na relationship between the patient of the treatment\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nbut a relationship of dependency.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nBut in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThis is, the kids will feel\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthe therapeutic object needs him.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo the idea is, all night long\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthe elastic skin of the third lung\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwill slowly inflate itself,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nincluding air and molecules, for sure.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd when the kids wake up,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nhe can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand breathe the air it contains.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo by this way,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthe kid, to take care of himself,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nis to take care of this living object.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nas the asthma treatment needs him.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nIn this guise of living object approach,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI like the idea of a kind of invisible design,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nas if the function of the object\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nexists in a kind of invisible field\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\njust around the objects themselves.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nWe could talk about a kind of soul,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nof a ghost accompanying them.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd almost a kind of poltergeist effect.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nSo when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nbecause it is -- woosh -- starting to move.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd I remember an exhibition design\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nI made for John Maeda,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd John Maeda was supposed to show\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nseveral graphic animations in this exhibition.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd my idea for this exhibition design was to create\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\na real pong game, like this one.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd the idea was to create some self-moving benches\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nin the main exhibition room.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo the living benches would be exactly like the ball.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, \"Okay let's go.\"\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nI remember the day of the opening.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nI was a little bit late.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWhen I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nin the exhibition room, John was just beside me,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand was like, \"Hmm. Hmm.\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd he told me, after a long silence,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\n\"I wonder, Mathieu, if\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\npeople won't be more fascinated by your benches\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthan by my videos.\"\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nIt would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nif he hadn't decided to take all them off\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ntwo hours before the opening.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo, huge tragedy.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nI guess you won't be surprised if I tell you\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nthat Pinocchio is one of my great influences.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nPinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nBecause it is a kind of object with a conscience,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nable to be modified by its surroundings,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand able to modify it as well.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThe other great influence is the mine's canary.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nIn coal mines, this canary\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nwas supposed to be close to the miners.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nSo this canary was a living alarm,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand a very efficient one.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nA very natural technology,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nin order to say to the miners,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\n\"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.\"\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nSo it's, for me, a great product.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd I tried to design a kind of canary.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nAndrea is one.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAndrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nfrom air, contaminated indoor air.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nSo it uses some plants to do this job,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nselected for their gas-filtering ability.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nYou have to know, or you probably already know,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nthat indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo while I'm talking to you,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthe seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\ninvisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo you are currently breathing formaldehyde.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt's the same for me with the carpet.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd this is exactly the same at home.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nBecause all the product we get constantly give away\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthe volatile component of which they're made of.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nSo let's have a look at your home.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nSo your sofa, your plastic chair,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nyour kid's toys\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\ngive their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThis is the reason why\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nI created, with David Edward,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\na scientist of Harvard University,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nan object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nBut the idea is to force\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthe air to go in the effective part of the plants.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nBecause the roots of the plant are not very effective.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBill Wolverton from NASA\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nanalyzed it cleverly in the '70s.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo the idea is to create an object\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nable to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nat the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nSo this is the final object.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nIt will be launched next September.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThis one is kind of the same approach\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nbecause I include, in a product\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nlike Andrea, some plants.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nAnd it includes some fishes as well.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nBut here, unlike Andrea,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nhere are supposed to be eaten.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIndeed, this object is a domestic farm,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nfor fishes and green.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nSo the idea of this object\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nis to be able to get at home\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nvery local food.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThe locavores\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nused to get food\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ntaken in a radius of 100 miles.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nLocal River is able to provide you\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nfood directly in your living room.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo the principle of this object\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nis to create an ecosystem\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\ncalled aquaponics.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nAnd the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nby a water pump, feeds the plants above.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd the plants will filter, by the roots,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nthe dirty water of the fish.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAfter, it goes back into the fish tank.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nAfter that you have two options.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nOr you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nAmazing channel.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nOr you start fishing.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nAnd you make some sushis with a fish\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nand the aromatic plants above.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBecause you can grow some potatoes.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nNo, not potatoes, but tomatoes,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\naromatic plants and so on.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nSo now we can breathe safely.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nNow we can eat local food.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nNow we can be treated by smart medicine.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nNow we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwith daylight.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nBut it was important to create a perfect place,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nso I tried to,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nin order to work and create.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nSo I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\na very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nI wanted to create a perfect place\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nwhere you can work and play,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nand where your body and your brain can work together.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nSo, in this office,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nyou do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nYour seat, your sleep and your play\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:41.958\non a big geodesic island made of leather.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nSee, like this one?\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nIn this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nbut you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nlike a prehistoric scientist.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo you, like that, can make some sport during your work.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nIn this office\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nyou

These are not discoveries of planets or new technologies or science. They're discoveries of people and the way people are, and new leadership.This is Benki. Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation. His people live in Brazil and in Peru. Benki comes from a village so remote up in the Amazon that to get there, either you have to fly and land on water, or go by canoe for several days. I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo when I'd brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world, because we wanted to learn from each other. We wanted to share our stories with each other.The Ashaninka people are known throughout South America for their dignity, their spirit and their resistance, starting with the Incas and continuing through the 19th century with the rubber tappers. Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people and to Benki comes from illegal logging \u2014 the people who come into the beautiful forest and cut down ancient mahogany trees, float them down the river to world markets. Benki knew this. He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment, because he was taken under his grandfather's wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people. His grandfather died when he was only 10. And at that young age, 10 years old, Benki became the paje of his community. Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture, the paje is the most important person in the community. This is the person who contains within him all the knowledge, all the wisdom of centuries and centuries of life, and not just about his people, but about everything that his people's survival depended on: the trees, the birds, the water, the soil, the forest. So when he was only 10 and he became the paje, he began to lead his people. He began to talk to them about the forest that they needed to protect, the way of life they needed to nurture. He explained to them that it was not a question of survival of the fittest; it was a question of understanding what they needed to survive and to protect that.Eight years later, when he was a young man of 18, Benki left the forest for the first time. He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio to the Earth Summit to tell the world what was happening in his tiny, little corner. And he went because he hoped the world would listen. Some did, not everybody. But if you can imagine this young man with his headdress and his flowing robe, learning a new language, Portuguese, not to mention English, going to Rio, building a bridge to reach out to people he'd never met before \u2014 a pretty hostile world. But he wasn't dismayed.Benki came back to his village full of ideas \u2014 new technologies, new research, new ways of understanding what was going on. Since that time, he's continued to work with his people, and not only the Ashaninka Nation, but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond. He's built schools to teach children to care for the forest. Together, he's led the reforestation of over 25 percent of the land that had been destroyed by the loggers. He's created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods. And he's brought the internet and satellite technology to the forest \u2014 both so that people themselves could monitor the deforestation, but also that he could speak from the forest to the rest of the world. If you were to meet Benki and ask him, \"Why are you doing this? Why are you putting yourself at risk? Why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a hostile world?\" he would tell you, as he told me, \"I asked myself,\" he said, \"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do to protect the forest for me? And what am I doing?\"So when I think of that, I wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren, when they ask themselves that question, I wonder how they will answer. For me, the world is veering towards a future we don't much want when we really think about it deep inside. It's a future we don't know the details of, but it's a future that has signs, just like Benki saw the signs around him. We know we are running out of what we need. We're running out of fresh water. We're running out of fossil fuels. We're running out of land. We know climate change is going to affect all of us. We don't know how, but we know it will. And we know that there will be more of us than ever before \u2014 five times as many people in 40 years than 60 years ago. We are running out of what we need. And we also know that the world has changed in other ways, that since 1960 there are one-third as many new countries that exist as independent entities on the planet. Egos, systems of government \u2014 figuring it out \u2014 massive change. And in addition to that, we know that five other really big countries are going to have a say in the future, a say we haven't even really started to hear yet \u2014 China, India, Russia, South Africa and Benki's own Brazil, where Benki got his civil rights only in the 1988 constitution.But you know all that. You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest and went 3,000 miles. You also know that we can't just keep doing what we've always done, because we'll get the results we've always gotten. And this reminds me of something I understand Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago, when she was pressing him, \"Please change.\" He said, \"Change? Why change? Things are bad enough as they are.\" We have to change. It's imperative to me, when I look around the world, that we need to change ourselves. We need new models of what it means to be a leader. We need new models of being a leader and a human in the world.I started life as a banker. Now I don't admit to that to anybody but my very close friends. But for the past eight years, I've done something completely different. My work has taken me around the world, where I've had the real privilege of meeting people like Benki and many others who are making change happen in their communities \u2014 people who see the world differently, who are asking different questions, who have different answers, who understand the filters that they wear when they go out into the world.This is Sanghamitra. Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore. I met Sanghamitra eight years ago when I was in Bangalore organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's working in some of the hardest aspects of society. Sanghamitra didn't start life as a leader of an NGO, she started her career as university professor, teaching English literature. But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that. She loved it, but she was too detached. And so in 1993, a long time ago, she decided to start a new organization called Samraksha focused on one of the hardest areas, one of the hardest issues in India \u2014 anywhere in the world at the time \u2014 HIV/AIDS. Since that time, Samraksha has grown from strength to strength and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India. But if you just think about the state of the world and knowledge of HIV/AIDS in 1993 \u2014 in India at that time it was skyrocketing and nobody understood why, and everyone was actually very, very afraid. Today there are still three million HIV-positive people in India. That's the second largest population in the world.When I asked Sanghamitra, \"How did you get from English literature to HIV/AIDS?\" not an obvious path, she said to me, \"It's all connected. Literature makes one sensitive, sensitive to people, to their dreams and to their ideas.\" Since that time, under her leadership, Samraksha has been a pioneer in all fields related to HIV/AIDS. They have respite homes, the first, the first care centers, the first counseling services \u2014 and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore, but in the hardest to reach villages in the state of Karnataka. Even that wasn't enough. She wanted to change policy at the government level. 10 of their programs that she pioneered are now government policy and funded by the government. They take care of 20,000-odd people today in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.She works with people like Murali Krishna. Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages. He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago, and he's HIV-positive. But he saw the work, the care, the compassion that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village, and he wanted to be part of it. He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work. They've pioneered a different approach to villages. Instead of handing out information in pamphlets, as is so often the case, they bring theater troupes, songs, music, dance. And they sit around, and they talk about dreams.Sanghamitra told me just last week \u2014 she had just come back from two weeks in the villages, and she had a real breakthrough. They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village. And the young women in the village spoke up and said, \"We've changed our dream. Our dream is for our partners, our husbands, not to be given to us because of a horoscope, but to be given to us because they've been tested for HIV.\" If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra and ask her why and how, how have you achieved so much? She would look at you and very quietly, very softly say, \"It just happened. It's the spirit inside.\"This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan. Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province in southwest China. He was born in 1957, and you can imagine what his childhood looked like and felt like, and what his life has been like over the last 50 tumultuous years. He's been a soldier, a teacher, a politician, a vice-mayor and a business man. But if you sat down and asked him, \"Who are you really, and what do you do?\" He would tell you, \"I'm a collector, and I curate a museum.\" I was lucky; I had heard about him for years, and I finally met him earlier this year at his museum in Chengdu.He's been a collector all of his life, starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's. Now, just think of the early 1960's in China. Over a lifetime, through everything, through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward, he's kept collecting, so that he now has over eight million pieces in his museums documenting contemporary Chinese history. These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world, in part because they document parts of history Chinese choose to forget. For example, he's got over one million pieces documenting the Sino-Japanese War, a war that's not talked about in China very much and whose heroes are not honored. Why did he do all this? Because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.So, from commissioning slightly larger than life bronze statues of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War, including those Chinese who then fought with each other and left mainland China to go to Taiwan, to commemorating all the unknown, ordinary soldiers who survived, by asking them to take prints of their hands, he is making sure \u2014 one man is making sure \u2014 that history is not forgotten. But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about. This building contains the world's largest collection of documents and artifacts commemorating the U.S. role in fighting on the Chinese side in that long war \u2014 the Flying Tigers. He has nine other buildings \u2014 that are already open to the public \u2014 filled to the rafters with artifacts documenting contemporary Chinese history. Two of the most sensitive buildings include a lifetime of collection about the Cultural Revolution, a period that actually most Chinese would prefer to forget. But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget.These people inspire me, and they inspire me because they show us what is possible when you change the way you look at the world, change the way you look at your place in the world. They looked outside, and then they changed what was on the inside. They didn't go to business school. They didn't read a manual, \"How to Be a Good Leader in 10 Easy Steps.\" But they have qualities we'd all recognize. They have drive, passion, commitment. They've gone away from what they did before, and they've gone to something they didn't know. They've tried to connect worlds they didn't know existed before. They've built bridges, and they've walked across them. They have a sense of the great arc of time and their tiny place in it. They know people have come before them and will follow them. And they know that they're part of a whole, that they depend on other people. It's not about them, they know that, but it has to start with them. And they have humility. It just happens.But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we? We know it takes a lot to make it happen, and we know the direction the world is going in. So I think we need succession planning on a global basis. We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners, to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need. I think it has to start with us. And we know, just like they knew, how hard it is. But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along; we have models, we have examples, like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan. We can look at what they've done, if we look. We can learn from what they've learned. We can change the way we see ourselves in the world. And if we're lucky, we can change the way our great-grandchildren will answer Benki's question.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 692, "subtitle":

00:03:54.958\nHe's built schools\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nto teach children to care for the forest.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nTogether, he's led the reforestation\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nof over 25 percent of the land\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat had been destroyed by the loggers.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nHe's created a cooperative\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nto help people diversify their livelihoods.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd he's brought the internet and satellite technology\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nto the forest --\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nboth so that people themselves\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\ncould monitor the deforestation,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbut also that he could speak from the forest\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nto the rest of the world.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIf you were to meet Benki\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand ask him, \"Why are you doing this?\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWhy are you putting yourself at risk?\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhy are you making yourself vulnerable\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nto what is often a hostile world?\"\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nhe would tell you,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nas he told me,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\n\"I asked myself,\" he said,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\n\"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nto protect the forest for me?\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd what am I doing?\"\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo when I think of that,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI wonder what our grandchildren\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand our great-grandchildren,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhen they ask themselves that question,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nI wonder how they will answer.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nFor me, the world is veering\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\ntowards a future we don't much want\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nwhen we really think about it deep inside.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nIt's a future we don't know the details of,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nbut it's a future that has signs,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\njust like Benki saw the signs around him.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nWe know we are running out of what we need.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nWe're running out of fresh water.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nWe're running out of fossil fuels.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWe're running out of land.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWe know climate change is going to affect all of us.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWe don't know how, but we know it will.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd we know that there will be more of us than ever before --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfive times as many people in 40 years\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthan 60 years ago.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWe are running out of what we need.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd we also know\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nthat the world has changed in other ways,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthat since 1960\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthere are one-third as many new countries\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthat exist as independent entities on the planet.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nEgos, systems of government --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nfiguring it out --\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nmassive change.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAnd in addition to that,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwe know that five other really big countries\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nare going to have a say in the future,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\na say we haven't even really started to hear yet --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nChina, India,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nRussia, South Africa\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand Benki's own Brazil,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwhere Benki got his civil rights\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nonly in the 1988 constitution.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nBut you know all that.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nYou know more than Benki knew when he left his forest\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand went 3,000 miles.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nYou also know\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthat we can't just keep doing what we've always done,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nbecause we'll get the results\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwe've always gotten.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd this reminds me of something I understand\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nLord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nwhen she was pressing him, \"Please change.\"\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nHe said, \"Change?\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nWhy change?\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThings are bad enough as they are.\"\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWe have to change.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nIt's imperative to me, when I look around the world,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthat we need to change ourselves.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWe need new models of what it means to be a leader.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWe need new models\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nof being a leader and a human in the world.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nI started life as a banker.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nNow I don't admit to that\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nto anybody but my very close friends.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut for the past eight years,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nI've done something completely different.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nMy work has taken me around the world,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwhere I've had the real privilege\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nof meeting people like Benki\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand many others who are making change happen\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin their communities --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\npeople who see the world differently,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwho are asking different questions,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwho have different answers,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwho understand the filters that they wear\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhen they go out into the world.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThis is Sanghamitra.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSanghamitra comes from Bangalore.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI met Sanghamitra eight years ago\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nwhen I was in Bangalore\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\norganizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nworking in some of the hardest aspects of society.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSanghamitra didn't start life\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nas a leader of an NGO,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nshe started her career as university professor,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nteaching English literature.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nShe loved it, but she was too detached.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd so in 1993,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\na long time ago,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nshe decided to start a new organization\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\ncalled Samraksha\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nfocused on one of the hardest areas,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\none of the hardest issues in India --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nanywhere in the world at the time --\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nHIV/AIDS.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSince that time, Samraksha has grown\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nfrom strength to strength\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nBut if you just think about the state of the world\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nand knowledge of HIV/AIDS\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nin 1993 --\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nin India at that time it was skyrocketing\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand nobody understood why,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand everyone was actually very, very afraid.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nToday there are still three million\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nHIV-positive people in India.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nThat's the second largest population in the world.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nWhen I asked Sanghamitra,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n\"How did you get from English literature\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nto HIV/AIDS?\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nnot an obvious path,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nshe said to me,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\n\"It's all connected.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nLiterature makes one sensitive,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nsensitive to people,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nto their dreams and to their ideas.\"\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSince that time, under her leadership,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSamraksha has been a pioneer\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nin all fields related\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nto HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThey have respite homes, the first,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthe first care centers,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nthe first counseling services --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbut in the hardest to reach villages\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nin the state of Karnataka.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nEven that wasn't enough.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nShe wanted to change policy at the government level.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n10 of their programs that she pioneered\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nare now government policy and funded by the government.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThey take care of 20,000-odd people today\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nin over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nShe works with people like Murali Krishna.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nMurali Krishna comes from one of those villages.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nHe lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand he's HIV-positive.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nBut he saw the work, the care,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthe compassion\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand he wanted to be part of it.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nHe's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey've pioneered a different approach to villages.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nInstead of handing out information in pamphlets,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nas is so often the case,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthey bring theater troupes,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nsongs, music, dance.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd they sit around,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand they talk about dreams.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSanghamitra told me just last week --\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nshe had just come back from two weeks in the villages,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand she had a real breakthrough.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThey were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nAnd the young women in the village\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nspoke up and said, \"We've changed our dream.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOur dream\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nis for our partners, our husbands,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nnot to be given to us because of a horoscope,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nbut to be given to us\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nbecause they've been tested for HIV.\"\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nIf you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand ask her why and how,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nhow have you achieved so much?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nShe would look at you\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand very quietly, very softly say,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\n\"It just happened.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nIt's the spirit inside.\"\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThis is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nJianchuan comes from Sichuan Province\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nin southwest China.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nHe was born in 1957,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand you can imagine what his childhood\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nlooked like and felt like,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand what his life has been like\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nover the last 50 tumultuous years.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nHe's been a soldier, a teacher,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\na politician, a vice-mayor\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand a business man.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBut if you sat down and asked him, \"Who are you really,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand what do you do?\"\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nHe would tell you, \"I'm a collector,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nand I curate a museum.\"\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nI was lucky; I had heard about him for years,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nand I finally met him earlier this year\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nat his museum in Chengdu.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nHe's been a collector all of his life,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nstarting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow, just think of the early 1960's in China.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nOver a lifetime, through everything,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nthrough the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhe's kept collecting,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nso that he now has over eight million pieces\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nin his museums\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\ndocumenting contemporary Chinese history.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThese are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nin part because they document parts of history\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nChinese choose to forget.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nFor example, he's got over one million pieces\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\ndocumenting the Sino-Japanese War,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\na war that's not talked about in China very much\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand whose heroes are not honored.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWhy did he do all this?\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nBecause he thought\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo, from commissioning\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nslightly larger than life bronze statues\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nof the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nincluding those Chinese\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nwho then fought with each other\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand left mainland China to go to Taiwan,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nto commemorating all the unknown,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nordinary soldiers who survived,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nby asking them to take prints of their hands,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nhe is making sure -- one man is making sure --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nthat history is not forgotten.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBut it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThis building contains the world's largest collection\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nof documents and artifacts\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\ncommemorating the U.S. role\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nin fighting on the Chinese side\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nin that long war --\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe Flying Tigers.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nHe has nine other buildings --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthat are already open to the public --\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nfilled to the rafters with artifacts\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\ndocumenting contemporary Chinese history.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nTwo of the most sensitive buildings\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\ninclude a lifetime of collection\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nabout the Cultural Revolution,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\na period that actually most Chinese\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nwould prefer to forget.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nBut he doesn't want his nation\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\never to forget.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThese people inspire me,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand they inspire me because they show us\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nwhat is possible when you change the way\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nyou look at the world,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nchange the way you look at your place in the world.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThey looked outside,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand then they changed what was on the inside.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThey didn't go to business school.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nThey didn't read a manual, \"How to Be a Good Leader\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nin 10 Easy Steps.\"\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nBut they have qualities we'd all recognize.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThey have drive, passion, commitment.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThey've gone away\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nfrom what they did before,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nand they've gone\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nto something they didn't know.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nThey've tried to connect worlds\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthey didn't know existed before.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThey've built bridges, and they've walked across them.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThey have a sense of the great arc of time\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand their tiny place in it.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThey know people have come before them\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand will follow them.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd they know that they're part of a whole,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nthat they depend on other people.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nIt's not about them, they know that,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nbut it has to start with them.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd they have humility.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt just happens.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBut we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe know it takes a lot to make it happen,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand we know the direction the world is going in.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nSo I think we need succession planning\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\non a global basis.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nWe can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nto come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nI think it has to start with us.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd we know, just like they knew,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nhow hard it is.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nBut the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nwe have models, we have examples,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nlike Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nWe can look at what they've done, if we look.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nWe can learn from what they've learned.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWe can change the way we see ourselves in the world.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd if we're lucky,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nwe can change the way\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nour great-grandchildren\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwill answer Benki's question.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "East vs. West -- the myths that mystify", "duration": "1106", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/devdutt_pattanaik", "transcript": "To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do, you have to hear a story of Ganesha, the elephant-headed god who is the scribe of storytellers, and his brother, the athletic warlord of the gods, Kartikeya. The two brothers one day decided to go on a race, three times around the world. Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. He went around once, he went around twice, he went around thrice. But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once, twice, thrice, and said, \"I won.\" \"How come?\" said Kartikeya. And Ganesha said, \"You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'\" What matters more?If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 'The world' is objective, logical, universal, factual, scientific. 'My world' is subjective. It's emotional. It's personal. It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams. It is the belief system that we carry. It's the myth that we live in.'The world' tells us how the world functions, how the sun rises, how we are born. 'My world' tells us why the sun rises, why we were born. Every culture is trying to understand itself: \"Why do we exist?\" And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life, its own customized version of mythology.Culture is a reaction to nature, and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories, symbols and rituals, which are always indifferent to rationality. And so, when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. Different people see things differently \u2014 different viewpoints.There is my world and there is your world, and my world is always better than your world, because my world, you see, is rational and yours is superstition. Yours is faith. Yours is illogical. This is the root of the clash of civilizations. It took place, once, in 326 B.C. on the banks of a river called the Indus, now in Pakistan. This river lends itself to India's name. India. Indus.Alexander, a young Macedonian, met there what he called a \"gymnosophist,\" which means \"the naked, wise man.\" We don't know who he was. Perhaps he was a Jain monk, like Bahubali over here, the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore. Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon.Alexander asked, \"What are you doing?\" and the gymnosophist answered, \"I'm experiencing nothingness.\" Then the gymnosophist asked, \"What are you doing?\" and Alexander said, \"I am conquering the world.\" And they both laughed. Each one thought that the other was a fool. The gymnosophist said, \"Why is he conquering the world? It's pointless.\" And Alexander thought, \"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing? What a waste of a life.\"To understand this difference in viewpoints, we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander \u2014 his myth, and the mythology that constructed it. Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer's \"Iliad.\" They told him of a great hero called Achilles, who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured, but when he withdrew from the battle, defeat was inevitable. \"Achilles was a man who could shape history, a man of destiny, and this is what you should be, Alexander.\" That's what he heard.\"What should you not be? You should not be Sisyphus, who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night. Don't live a life which is monotonous, mediocre, meaningless. Be spectacular! \u2014 like the Greek heroes, like Jason, who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece. Be spectacular like Theseus, who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur. When you play in a race, win! \u2014 because when you win, the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.\"Because, you see, the Greeks believed you live only once, and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx. And if you have lived an extraordinary life, you will be welcomed to Elysium, or what the French call \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 the heaven of the heroes.But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard. He heard a very different story. He heard of a man called Bharat, after whom India is called Bh\u0101rata. Bharat also conquered the world. And then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. And he wanted to hoist his flag to say, \"I was here first.\" But when he reached the mountain peak, he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him, each one claiming \"'I was here first' ... that's what I thought until I came here.\" And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity, Bharat felt insignificant. This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.You see, he had heroes, like Ram \u2014 Raghupati Ram and Krishna, Govinda Hari. But they were not two characters on two different adventures. They were two lifetimes of the same hero. When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. When Ram dies, Krishna is born. When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.You see, the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. But you don't cross it once. You go to and fro endlessly. It was called the Vaitarani. You go again and again and again. Because, you see, nothing lasts forever in India, not even death. And so, you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days ... And what do you do at the end of 10 days? You dunk it in the river. Because it has to end. And next year, she will come back. What goes around always comes around, and this rule applies not just to man, but also the gods. You see, the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram, as Krishna. Not only do they live infinite lives, but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all. \"Groundhog Day.\" (Laughter)Two different mythologies. Which is right? Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world. One linear, one cyclical. One believes this is the one and only life. The other believes this is one of many lives. And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one. So, the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. So, no matter what he did, it was always zero. And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. Who knows?And that brings us to the mythology of business. If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in. You see, what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves? And if you look at cultures around the world, all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business.Take a look. If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world, you will see an obsession with binary logic, absolute truth, standardization, absoluteness, linear patterns in design. But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic, with opinion, with contextual thinking, with everything is relative, sort of \u2014 (Laughter) mostly. (Laughter)You look at art. Look at the ballerina, how linear she is in her performance. And then look at the Indian classical dancer, the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer, curvaceous. (Laughter)And then look at business. Standard business model: vision, mission, values, processes. Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land, with the commandments held by the leader. And if you comply, you will go to heaven.But in India there is no \"the\" promised land. There are many promised lands, depending on your station in society, depending on your stage of life. You see, businesses are not run as institutions, by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. It's always about taste. It's always about my taste.You see, Indian music, for example, does not have the concept of harmony. There is no orchestra conductor. There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows. And you can never replicate that performance twice. It is not about documentation and contract. It's about conversation and faith. It's not about compliance. It's about setting, getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules \u2014 just look at your Indian people around here, you'll see them smile; they know what it is. (Laughter) And then look at people who have done business in India, you'll see the exasperation on their faces. (Laughter) (Applause)You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse, chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable. And people are okay with it. And then globalization is taking place. The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in. Which is rooted in one-life culture. And a clash is going to take place, like on the banks of the Indus. It is bound to happen.I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. I love mythology too much. I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. So, I had to teach it to myself. And mythology does not pay, well, until now. (Laughter) So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. And I worked in the healthcare industry. And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy, and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy. I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics. And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues, when they were dealing with India.Example: Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. (Laughter) How do you parameterize \"mostly\"? How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.I would give my viewpoints to people. But nobody was interested in listening to it, you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar. And there are more than 200 formats, across 50 cities and towns of India. And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. And he knew very intuitively, that best practices, developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India. He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said, \"All I want to do is align belief.\" Sounds so simple. But belief is not measurable. You can't measure it. You can't manage it. So, how do you construct belief? How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness. Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture, which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals. And I will share one of the rituals with you. You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. Hindus don't have the concept of commandments. So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God. You want to see God. And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes, large unblinking eyes, sometimes made of silver, so they look at you. Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy. \"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad.\" (Laughter) \"Why did I do the setting, why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please.\"And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders. After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store, we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders, the customer, his family, his team, his boss. You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys, and then you remove the blindfold. And invariably, you see a tear, because the penny has dropped. He realizes that to succeed, he does not have to be a \"professional,\" he does not have to cut out his emotions, he has to include all these people in his world to succeed, to make them happy, to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy. The customer is happy, because the customer is God.That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters, behavior will happen, business will happen. And it has. So, then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist. And everybody asks me, \"Which is the better way, this way or that way?\" And it's a very dangerous question, because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence. So, I will not answer the question. What I will give you is an Indian answer, the Indian head-shake. (Laughter) (Applause)Depending on the context, depending on the outcome, choose your paradigm. You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions. They are cultural creations, not natural phenomena. And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger, one request: Understand that you live in the subjective truth, and so does he. Understand it.

\"the naked, wise man.\"\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nWe don't know who he was.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nPerhaps he was a Jain monk,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nlike Bahubali over

yogi\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwho was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand the sun and the moon.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAlexander asked, \"What are you doing?\"\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand the gymnosophist answered,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\n\"I'm experiencing nothingness.\"\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThen the

they both laughed.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nEach one thought that the other was a fool.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe gymnosophist said, \"Why is he conquering the world?\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's pointless.\"\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd Alexander thought,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\n\"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWhat a waste of a life.\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nTo understand this difference in viewpoints,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwe have to understand\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe subjective truth of Alexander --\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nhis myth, and the mythology that constructed it.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAlexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\ntold him the story of Homer's \"Iliad.\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThey told him of a great hero called Achilles,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nwho, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut when he withdrew from the battle,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\ndefeat was inevitable.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n\"Achilles was a man who could shape history,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\na man of

be?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nYou should not be Sisyphus,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwho rolls a rock up a mountain all day\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nonly to find the boulder rolled down at night.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nDon't live a life which is monotonous,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nmediocre, meaningless.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nBe spectacular! --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nlike the Greek heroes,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nlike Jason, who went across the sea\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwith the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBe spectacular like Theseus,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwho entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWhen you play in a race, win! --\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbecause when you win, the exhilaration of victory\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nis the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods.\"\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nBecause, you see, the Greeks believed\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nyou live only once,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nand when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd if you have lived an extraordinary life,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nyou will be welcomed to Elysium,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nor what the French call \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthe heaven of the heroes.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nBut these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nHe heard a very different story.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nHe heard of a man called Bharat,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nafter whom India is called Bh\u0101rata.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nBharat also conquered the world.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd then he went to the top-most peak\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nof the greatest mountain of the center of the world\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ncalled Meru.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd he wanted to hoist his flag to say,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n\"I was here first.\"\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nBut when he reached the mountain peak,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nhe found the peak covered with countless flags\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nof world-conquerors before him,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\neach one claiming \"'I was here first' ...\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthat's what I thought until I came here.\"\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBharat felt insignificant.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThis was the mythology of the gymnosophist.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand Krishna, Govinda Hari.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nBut they were not two characters on two different adventures.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nThey were two lifetimes of the same hero.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWhen the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWhen Ram dies, Krishna is born.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nWhen Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nYou see, the Indians also had a river\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthat separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nBut you don't cross it once.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nYou go to and fro endlessly.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nIt was called the Vaitarani.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nYou go again and again and again.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nBecause, you see,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nnothing lasts forever in India, not even death.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd so, you have these grand rituals\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwhere great images of mother goddesses are built\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand worshiped for 10 days ...\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd what do you do at the end of 10 days?\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nYou dunk it in the river.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nBecause it has to end.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd next year, she will come back.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWhat goes around always comes around,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand this rule applies not just to man,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut also the gods.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nYou see, the gods\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nhave to come back again and again and again\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nas Ram, as Krishna.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nNot only do they live infinite lives,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nbut the same life is lived infinite times\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\ntill you get to the point of it all.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\n\"Groundhog Day.\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nTwo different mythologies.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWhich is right?\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nTwo different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nOne linear, one cyclical.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nOne believes this is the one and only life.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThe other believes this is one of many lives.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nSo, the value of his life was the sum total\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nof his achievements.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo, no matter what he did,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nit was always zero.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd I believe it is this mythological paradigm\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nthat inspired Indian mathematicians\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nto discover the number zero.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nWho knows?\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd that brings us to the mythology of business.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nIf Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nif the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthen it was bound to influence the business they were in.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nYou see, what is business\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut the result of how the market behaves\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand how the organization behaves?\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd if you look at cultures around the world,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nall you have to do is understand the mythology\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand you will see how they behave and how they do business.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nTake a look.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nIf you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nyou will see an obsession with binary logic,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nabsolute truth, standardization,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nabsoluteness, linear patterns in design.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nBut if you look at cultures which have cyclical\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwith opinion,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwith contextual thinking,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwith everything is relative, sort of --\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nmostly.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nYou look at art. Look at the ballerina,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nhow linear she is in her performance.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd then look at the Indian classical dancer,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\ncurvaceous.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd then look at business.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nStandard business model:\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nvision, mission, values, processes.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSounds very much like the journey through\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthe wilderness to the promised land,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nwith the commandments held by the leader.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd if you comply, you will go to heaven.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nBut in India there is no \"the\" promised land.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThere are many promised lands,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ndepending on your station in society,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ndepending on your stage of life.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nYou see, businesses are not run as institutions,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nby the idiosyncrasies of individuals.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nIt's always about taste.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt's always about my taste.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nYou see, Indian music, for example,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\ndoes not have the concept of harmony.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThere is no orchestra conductor.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThere is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd you can never replicate that performance twice.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nIt is not about documentation and contract.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt's about conversation and faith.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nIt's not about compliance. It's about setting,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\ngetting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\njust look at your Indian people around here,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nyou'll see them smile; they know what it is.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd then look at people who have done business in India,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nyou'll see the exasperation on their faces.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou see, this is what India is today. The ground reality\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nis based on a cyclical world view.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nchaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd people are okay with it.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd then globalization is taking place.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThe demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nWhich is rooted in one-life culture.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd a clash is going to take place,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nlike on the banks of the Indus.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIt is bound to happen.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nI have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nI did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nI love mythology too much.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nSo, I had to teach it to myself.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd mythology does not pay, well, until now.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nAnd I worked in the healthcare industry.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nI even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd I would see the exasperation\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nbetween my American and European colleagues,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nwhen they were dealing with India.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nExample: Please tell us the process\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nto invoice hospitals.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nStep A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nHow do you parameterize \"mostly\"?\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nHow do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI would give my viewpoints to people.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBut nobody was interested in listening to it,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nyou see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nYou see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd there are more than 200 formats,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nacross 50 cities and towns of India.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd he knew very intuitively,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat best practices,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\ndeveloped in Japan and China and Europe and America\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwill not work in India.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nHe knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nHe had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nSo, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\n\"All I want to do is align belief.\"\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nSounds so simple.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBut belief is not measurable.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nYou can't measure it. You can't manage it.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nSo, how do you construct belief?\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nHow do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nEven if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nSo, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwhich is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd I will share one of the rituals with you.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nYou see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nHindus don't have the concept of commandments.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nSo, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nSo, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nSo, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nYou want to see God.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nlarge unblinking eyes,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nsometimes made of silver,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nso they look at you.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nBecause you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nis divine empathy.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\n\"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad.\"\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\n\"Why did I do the setting,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nwhy I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please.\"\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nAfter a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nwe blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nthe customer, his family, his team, his boss.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nYou read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nand then you remove the blindfold.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nAnd invariably, you see a tear,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nbecause the penny has dropped.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nHe realizes that to succeed,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nhe does not have to be a \"professional,\"\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nhe does not have to cut out his emotions,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nhe has to include all these people\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nin his world to succeed, to make them happy,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nto make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nThe customer is happy, because the customer is God.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThat sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbehavior will happen, business will happen.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nAnd it has.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, then we come back to Alexander\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nand to the gymnosophist.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nAnd everybody asks me, \"Which is the better way, this way or that way?\"\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd it's a very dangerous question,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nbecause it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo, I will not answer the question.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nWhat I will give you is an Indian answer,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthe Indian head-shake.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nDepending on the context,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\ndepending on the outcome,\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nchoose your paradigm.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nYou see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nThey are cultural creations,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nnot natural phenomena.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\none request:\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nUnderstand that you live in the subjective truth,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nand so does he.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nUnderstand it.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nAnd when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nYou will discover that within infinite myths\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nlies the eternal truth.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nWho sees it all?\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nVaruna has but a thousand eyes.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nIndra, a hundred.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nYou and I, only two.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nThank you. Namaste.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Learn to use the 13th-century astrolabe", "duration": "565", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_demos_the_13th_century_astrolabe", "transcript": "As technology progresses, and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world. And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case, as progress is simply a word for change, and with change you gain something, but you also lose something.And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very common, an everyday question. And that question is this. What time is it? What time is it? If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time. But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone? How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago? How would you do it?Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe. So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world. But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day. It was the world's first popular computer. And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky. So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type, the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars. The plate corresponds to a coordinate system. And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.If you were an educated child, you would know how to not only use the astrolabe, you would also know how to make an astrolabe. And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language, was written by Geoffrey Chaucer. Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391, to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son. And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection. And basically, the concept is, how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface. The idea is actually relatively simple. Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe, and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere. Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole, onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device. The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle. The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete. And the altitude corresponds to the plate system. Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection. The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly. There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete. And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?So how would you use this device? Well, let me first back up for a moment. This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it? And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of \u2014 Museum of History. And you can see the different components. This is the mater, the scales on the back. This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that? That's the movable part of the sky. And in the back you can see a spider web pattern. And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky. This is a rule device. And on the back are some other devices, measuring tools and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?You know, I've always wanted one of these. For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper. And this one, this is a replica from a 15th-century device. And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros. But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some \u2014 you know, a church. They are just incredibly expensive.But let me show you how to work this device. So let's go to step one. First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky, if you're telling time at night. So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle. And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb. Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb. So, step two, I hold the device up, and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now. And then I measure its altitude. So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there. Step three is identify the star on the front of the device. Deneb is there. I can tell. Step four is I then move the rete, move the sky, so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back. Okay, so when that happens everything lines up. I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky. Okay? So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands. And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here. Right. So, that's how the device is used. (Laughter)So, I know what you're thinking: \"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?\" as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time. But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod you can tell \u2014 or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision. The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky. He would know where things would fit in the sky. He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky. He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set. And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens.So, in computer graphics and computer user interface design, there is a term called affordances. So, affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it. And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us, to connect to the night sky, to look up into the night sky and be much more \u2014 to see the visible and the invisible together. So, that's just one use. Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses. In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer.On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation. You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it. It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types. And it would take a full university course to illustrate it. Astrolabes have an incredible history. They are over 2,000 years old. The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C.And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms. There is portable ones. There is large display ones. And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art. There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable.Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time. So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive. And advancing retes became cultural emblems. This is one from Oxford. And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical, and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky. How cool is that? This is just amazing.So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe? Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood, or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket. So, what does the astrolabe inspire? Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago. It's just an incredible device.Every technology advances. Every technology is transformed and moved by others. And what we gain with a new technology, of course, is precision and accuracy. But what we lose, I think, is an accurate \u2014 a felt sense of the sky, a sense of context. Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky, is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is.So, it's \u2014 I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices. And so, what can you learn from these devices? Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world. And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together, and also how we connect to the world. Thanks very much.

What time is it?\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIf you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nBut, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nif you didn't have an iPhone?\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nHow would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nHow would you do it?\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nWell, the way you would do it is by using a device\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat's called an astrolabe.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nSo, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nBut, at the time, in the 13th century,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nit was the gadget of the day.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nIt was the world's first popular computer.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nAnd it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nSo, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nthe rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThe plate corresponds to a coordinate system.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nAnd the mater has some scales and puts it all together.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nIf you were an educated child,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nyou would know how to not only use the astrolabe,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nyou would also know how to make an astrolabe.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nthe first technical manual in the English language,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nwas written by Geoffrey Chaucer.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nYes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nto his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd the central idea that makes this computer work\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nis this thing called stereographic projection.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd basically, the concept is,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nhow do you represent the three-dimensional image\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nof the night sky that surrounds us\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nonto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThe idea is actually relatively simple.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nImagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nEach point on the surface of the sphere\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nis mapped through the bottom pole,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nonto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nSo the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThe ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\ncorrespond to an offset circle.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThe bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd the altitude corresponds to the plate system.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nso they fit perfectly.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThere is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd then there is their location on the sky\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nas seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nSo how would you use this device?\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWell, let me first back up for a moment.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThis is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd so, this astrolabe is on loan from us\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nfrom the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd you can see the different components.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThis is the mater, the scales on the back.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThis is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThat's the movable part of the sky.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd in the back you can see\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\na spider web pattern.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThis is a rule device. And on the back\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nare some other devices, measuring tools\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nYou know, I've always wanted one of these.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nFor my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd this one, this is a replica\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nfrom a 15th-century device.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut a real one would cost about as much as my house,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\non both sides of the street,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nmaybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThey are just incredibly expensive.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nBut let me show you how to work this device.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo let's go to step one.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nFirst thing that you do is you select a star\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nin the night sky, if you're telling time at night.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nSo, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nSecond, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo, step two, I hold the device up,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand then I sight its altitude there\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nso I can see it clearly now.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd then I measure its altitude.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nStep three is identify the star on the front of the device.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nDeneb is there. I can tell.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nStep four is I then move the rete,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nmove the sky, so the altitude of the star\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\ncorresponds to the scale on the back.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nOkay, so when that happens\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\neverything lines up.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nI have here a model of the sky\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat corresponds to the real sky. Okay?\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo, it is, in a sense,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nholding a model of the universe in my hands.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd then finally, I take a rule,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand move the rule to a date line\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwhich then tells me the time here.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nRight. So, that's how the device is used.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, I know what you're thinking:\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\n\"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?\"\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nas you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBut there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nyou can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwhat the time is, with precision.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThe way little Lewis would tell the time\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nis by a picture of the sky.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nHe would know where things would fit in the sky.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nHe would not only know what time it was,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nhe would also know where the sun would rise,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand how it would move across the sky.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nHe would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd he would know that for essentially every celestial object\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nin the heavens.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo, in computer graphics\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand computer user interface design,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthere is a term called affordances.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo, affordances are the qualities of an object\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat allow us to perform an action with it.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd what the astrolabe does is it allows us,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nit affords us, to connect to the night sky,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nto look up into the night sky and be much more --\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto see the visible and the invisible together.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo, that's just one use. Incredible,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthere is probably 350, 400 uses.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nIn fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nof this first computer.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nOn the back there is scales and measurements\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nfor terrestrial navigation.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIt can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd it would take a full university course to illustrate it.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nAstrolabes have an incredible history.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nThey are over 2,000 years old.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThe concept of stereographic projection\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\noriginated in 330 B.C.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd the astrolabes come in many different\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nsizes and shapes and forms.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThere is portable ones. There is large display ones.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd I think what is common to all astrolabes\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nis that they are beautiful works of art.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nThere is a quality of craftsmanship and precision\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat is just astonishing and remarkable.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAstrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd advancing retes became cultural emblems.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThis is one from Oxford.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nis completely symmetrical,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nHow cool is that? This is just amazing.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nSo, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nProbably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nor paper. And the vast majority of this first computer\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nwas a portable device\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat you could keep in the back of your pocket.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo, what does the astrolabe inspire?\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWell, I think the first thing is that\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nit reminds us just how resourceful people were,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nour forebears were, years and years ago.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt's just an incredible device.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nEvery technology advances.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nEvery technology is transformed and moved by others.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd what we gain with a new technology, of course,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nis precision and accuracy.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nBut what we lose, I think, is\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nan accurate -- a felt sense\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nof the sky, a sense of context.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nKnowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nis the center of the real answer\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nto knowing what time it is.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nAnd so, what can you learn from these devices?\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWell, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthat we can connect with the world.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd astrolabes return us to this subtle sense\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nof how things all fit together,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand also how we connect to the world.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Asia's rise -- how and when", "duration": "950", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_asia_s_rise_how_and_when", "transcript": "Once upon a time, at the age of 24, I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore. I was a guest student during one month of a public health course. And that changed my mindset forever. The course was good, but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset. It was the brutal realization, the first morning, that the Indian students were better than me.(Laughter)You see, I was a study nerd. I loved statistics from a young age. And I studied very much in Sweden. I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter. And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. They read the textbook twice, or three times or four times. In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.(Laugher)And that, to me, that personal experience was the first time in my life that the mindset I grew up with was changed. And I realized that perhaps the Western world will not continue to dominate the world forever. And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience. It's that realization of someone you meet that really made you change your ideas about the world. It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.And I will now, here, onstage, try to predict when that will happen \u2014 that Asia will regain its dominant position as the leading part of the world, as it used to be, over thousands of years. And I will do that by trying to predict precisely at what year the average income per person in India, in China, will reach that of the West. And I don't mean the whole economy, because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. \u2014 that's a piece of cake, with one billion people. But I want to see when will the average pay, the money for each person, per month, in India and China, when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?But I will start with a historical background. And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know? I will start at 1858. 1858 was a year of great technological advancement in the West. That was the year when Queen Victoria was able, for the first time, to communicate with President Buchanan, through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. And they were the first to \"Twitter\" transatlantically. (Laughter) (Applause) And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet, to find the text of the telegram sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria. And it ends like this: \"This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion, civilization, liberty and law throughout the world.\"Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom. And we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858. Because 1858 was also watershed year in the history of Asia. 1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of India was defeated by the British forces. And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.1858 in China was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces. And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty, were allowed to trade freely in China. It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.And 1858 in Japan was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S. And they were threatened by those black ships there, that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year. But, Japan, in contrast to India and China, maintained its national sovereignty.And let's see how much difference that can make. And I will do that by bringing these bubbles back to a Gapminder graph here, where you can see each bubble is a country. The size of the bubble here is the population. On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar. And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people. And I also bring an innovation here. I have transformed the laser beam into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.(Applause)And we will see, you know. Look here, 1858, India was here, China was here, Japan was there, United States and United Kingdom was richer over there. And I will start the world like this. India was not always like this level. Actually if we go back into the historical record, there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in India and China was even above that of Europe. But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination, and India had been de-industrialized. And you can see that the countries who were growing their economy was United States and United Kingdom. And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy, and Japan was starting to catch up. India was trying down here. Can you see how it starts to move there? But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan. And Japan is trying to move up there.And it's the new century now. Health is getting better, United Kingdom, United States. But careful now \u2014 we are approaching the First World War. And the First World War, you know, we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here. United Kingdom is going down. And now comes the Spanish flu also. And then after the First World War, they continue up. Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty, India and China are down in the corner. Not much has happened. They have grown their population but not much more. In the 1930's now, you can see that Japan is going to a period of war, with lower life expectancy. And the Second World War was really a terrible event, also economically for Japan. But they did recover quite fast afterwards. And we are moving into the new world. In 1947 India finally gained its independence. And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation, but in very big difficulties down there.(Applause)In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China in a way which surprised the world. And what happened? What happens in the after independence? You can see that the health started to improve. Children started to go to school. Health services were provided. This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down. It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung. China recovered. Then they said, \"Nevermore, stupid central planning.\" But they went up here, and India was trying to follow. And they were catching up indeed. And both countries had the better health, but still a very low economy.And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died, and a new guy turned up from the left. And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here. And he said, \"Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice.\" Because catching mice is what the two cats wanted to do. And you can see the two cats being here, China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know. And they decided to go not only for health and education, but also starting to grow their economy. And the market reformer was successful there. In '92 India follows with a market reform. And they go quite closely together, and you can see that the similarity with India and China, in many ways, are greater than the differences with them.And here they march on. And will they catch up?This is the big question today. There they are today.Now what does it mean that the \u2014 (Applause) the averages there \u2014 this is the average of China. If I would split China, look here, Shanghai has already catched up. Shanghai is already there. And it's healthier than the United States. But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest inland provinces of China, is there. And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural, the rural part of Guizhou goes down there. You see this enormous inequity in China, in the midst of fast economic growth.And if I would also look at India, you have another type of inequity, actually, in India. The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big. Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here, is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India. Kerala is flying on top there, matching United States in health, but not in economy. And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai, is forging forward. Now in India, the big inequities are within the state, rather than between the states. And that is not a bad thing, in itself. If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities can be more difficult in the long term to deal with, than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center relatively close to where poor people are living.No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States. (Laughter) Oh, they broke my frame. Washington, D.C. went out here. My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this because there is a new leader in Washington who is really concerned about the health system. And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C. is so rich over there but they are not as healthy as Kerala. It's quite interesting, isn't it? (Applause) I can see a business opportunity for Kerala, helping fix the health system in the United States.(Laughter)(Applause)Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there. And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward, you see that in between them and ahead of them, is the whole emerging economies of the world, which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the \"flat world.\" You can see that in health and education, a large part of the world population is putting forward, but in Africa, and other parts, as in rural Guizhou in China, there is still people with low health and very low economy. We have an enormous disparity in the world. But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.Now, back to my projections. When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph. I will show income per person on this axis instead, poor down here, rich up there. And then time here, from 1858 I start the world. And we shall see what will happen with these countries. You see, China under foreign domination actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here. Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer. And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K. But independence is coming here. Growth is starting, economic reform. Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF you can see where you expect them to be in 2014.Now, the question is, \"When will the catch up take place?\" Look at, look at the United States. Can you see the bubble? The bubbles, not my bubbles, but the financial bubbles. That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there. You see it came down there. And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know. So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries. They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know. And people interested in growth are turning their eyes towards Asia.I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up. You see, Japan did it like that. We add Japan to it. And there is no doubt that fast catch up can take place. Can you see here what Japan did? Japan did it like this, until full catch up, and then they follow with the other high-income economies. But the real projections for those ones, I would like to give it like this. Can be worse, can be better. It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future. Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.(Laughter)I think I'm in a difficult position here. Inequalities in China and India I consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market, what will avoid social instability, and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population. So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure, and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.You know the climate. We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing, and actions has to be taken, otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change. And I consider India and China the best partners in the world in a good global climate policy. But they ain't going to pay for what others, who have more money, have largely created, and I can agree on that.But what I'm really worried about is war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy, and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years, back to Asia? And will Asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world? So, always avoid war, because that always pushes human beings backward. Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided, get ready for a world in equity, because this is what seems to be happening.And that vision that I got as a young student, 1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes, is just about to happen. And it will happen precisely the year 2048 in the later part of the summer, in July, more precisely, the 27th of July. (Applause) The 27th of July, 2048 is my 100th birthday.

You know?\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nI will start at 1858.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.958\n1858 was a year of great technological\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nadvancement in the West.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThat was the year when Queen Victoria\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwas able, for the first time, to communicate\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwith President Buchanan,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nthrough the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd they were the first to \"Twitter\" transatlantically.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nto find the text of the telegram\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nsent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd it ends like this: \"This telegraph\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nis a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\ncivilization, liberty and law throughout the world.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThose are nice words.

Health is getting better,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nUnited Kingdom, United States.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nBut careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd the First World War, you know,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nUnited Kingdom is going down.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd now comes the Spanish flu also.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd then after the First World War, they continue up.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nStill under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIndia and China are down in the corner.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nNot much has happened.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThey have grown their population but not much more.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn the 1930's now, you can see\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nthat Japan is going to a period of war,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwith lower life expectancy.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd the Second World War was really a terrible event,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nalso economically for Japan.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBut they did recover quite fast afterwards.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd we are moving into the new world.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nIn 1947 India finally\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ngained its independence.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nbut in very big difficulties down there.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIn 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nin a way which surprised the world.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd what happened?\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nWhat happens in the after independence?\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nYou can see that the health started to improve.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nChildren started to go to school.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nHealth services were provided.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nThis is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nIt was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nChina recovered. Then they said,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\n\"Nevermore, stupid central planning.\"\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut they went up here, and India was trying to follow.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd they were catching up indeed.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd both countries had the better health, but still\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\na very low economy.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand a new guy turned up from the left.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAnd he said, \"Doesn't matter\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nif a cat is white or black,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nas long as it catches mice.\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nBecause catching mice\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nis what the two cats wanted to do.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd you can see the two cats being here,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nChina and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd they decided to go not only for health and education,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nbut also starting to grow their economy.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd the market reformer was successful there.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nIn '92 India follows with a market reform.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd they go quite closely together,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand you can see that the similarity with India and China,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nin many ways, are greater than the differences with them.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd here they march on. And will they catch up?\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThis is the big question today.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThere they are today.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nNow what does it mean that the --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthe averages there -- this is the average of China.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIf I would split China, look here,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nShanghai has already catched up.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nShanghai is already there.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd it's healthier than the United States.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nBut on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\ninland provinces of China, is there.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthe rural part of Guizhou goes down there.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nYou see this enormous inequity in China,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nin the midst of fast economic growth.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd if I would also look at India,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nyou have another type of inequity, actually, in India.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThe geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nUttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nis poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nKerala is flying on top there,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nmatching United States in health,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbut not in economy.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nis forging forward.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nNow in India, the big inequities are within the state,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nrather than between the states.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAnd that is not a bad thing, in itself.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nIf you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ncan be more difficult in the long term to deal with,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nthan if it is in the same area where you have a growth center\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nrelatively close to where poor people are living.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nNo, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOh, they broke my frame.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWashington, D.C. went out here.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nMy friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nbecause there is a new leader in Washington\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwho is really concerned about the health system.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nis so rich over there\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nbut they are not as healthy as Kerala.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nIt's quite interesting, isn't it?\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI can see a business opportunity for Kerala,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nhelping fix the health system in the United States.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nNow here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nyou see that in between them\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand ahead of them,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nis the whole emerging economies of the world,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nwhich Thomas Friedman so correctly called the \"flat world.\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nYou can see that in health and education,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\na large part of the world population is putting forward,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nbut in Africa, and other parts,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nas in rural Guizhou in China,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthere is still people with low health and very low economy.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nWe have an enormous disparity in the world.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nBut most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nNow, back to my projections.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nWhen will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI will show income per person on this axis instead,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\npoor down here, rich up there.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd then time here, from 1858\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI start the world.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd we shall see what will happen with these countries.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nYou see, China under foreign domination\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nactually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nWhereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nBut independence is coming here.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nGrowth is starting, economic reform.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nGrowth is faster, and with projection from IMF\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nyou can see where you expect them to be in 2014.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow, the question is, \"When will the catch up take place?\"\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nLook at, look at the United States.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nCan you see the bubble?\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThe bubbles, not my bubbles,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nbut the financial bubbles.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThat's the dot com bubble.

This is Japan coming up.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nYou see, Japan did it like that.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe add Japan to it.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd there is no doubt that fast catch up\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ncan take place.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nCan you see here what Japan did?\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nJapan did it like this, until full catch up,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand then they follow with the other high-income economies.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut the real projections for those ones,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nI would like to give it like this.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nCan be worse, can be better.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nIt's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nNow, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nI think I'm in a difficult position here.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nInequalities in China and India\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nI consider really the big obstacle\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nbecause to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nis what will create a domestic market,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwhat will avoid social instability,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand which will make use of the entire capacity\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nof the population.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand electricity is really what is needed in India and China.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nYou know the climate. We have great international experts\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nwithin India telling us that the climate is changing,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand actions has to be taken,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\notherwise China and India would be the countries\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nmost to suffer from climate change.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd I consider India and China the best partners in the world\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nin a good global climate policy.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nBut they ain't going to pay\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nfor what others, who have more money,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nhave largely created, and I can agree on that.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nBut what I'm really worried about is war.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nWill the former rich countries really accept\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\na completely changed world economy,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nand a shift of power away from where it has been\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nthe last 50 to 100 to 150 years,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nback to Asia?\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd will Asia be able to handle that\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nnew position of being in charge\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nof being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nSo, always avoid war,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbecause that always pushes human beings backward.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nNow if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nget ready for a world in equity,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nbecause this is what seems to be happening.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd that vision that I got as a young student,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:54.958\n1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nis just about to happen.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nAnd it will happen precisely\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nthe year 2048\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nin the later part of the summer, in July,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nmore precisely, the 27th of July.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThe 27th of July, 2048\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nis my 100th birthday.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I expect to speak\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nin the first session of the 39th TED India.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nGet your bookings in time.

Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us. Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.But I want to tell you a different story here today. Like all stories, it has a beginning. My work, for a long time, has been involved in education, in teaching people practical skills for sustainability, teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food, how to build buildings using local materials, how to generate their own energy, and so on.I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland, and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing. But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model, and moderating what comes in at one end, and moderating the outputs at the other end. And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly.And in order to introduce you to that, I've got something here that I'm going to unveil, which is one of the great marvels of the modern age. And it's something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate. If you could help me with that it would be fantastic. (Laughter) This is a liter of oil.This bottle of oil, distilled over a hundred million years of geological time, ancient sunlight, contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor \u2014 equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you. We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials, medicine, modern clothing, laptops, a whole range of different things. It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically. We've based the design of our settlements, our business models, our transport plans, even the idea of economic growth, some would argue, on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.Yet, when we take a step back, and look over the span of history, at what we might call the petroleum interval, it's a short period in history where we've discovered this extraordinary material, and then based a whole way of life around it. But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage, we move from a time where our economic success, our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume, to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability.And it's increasingly clear that we aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that we're going to have this at our disposal forever. For every four barrels of oil that we consume, we only discover one. And that gap continues to widen. There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling. In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it. Completely unprecedented, historically. Already that's fallen to about 11. And that's why, now, the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta, or at the bottom of the oceans.There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world. But of those, 65 have already passed their peak. The moment when the world on average passes this peak, people wonder when that's going to happen. And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high.But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side? No. But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are.There is also the issue of climate change, is the other thing that underpins this transition approach. But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists, is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes, as the data that's coming in, which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about. So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario. Actually, if current trends continue, it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time. If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms, it would offset all the savings that we need to make, in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change. We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.But I'm always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us. \"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain, that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance.\" And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.We had stories like \"The Seven-League Boots\": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge. Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.There is the story of \"The Elves and the Shoemaker.\" The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and all the shoes are magically made for them. It's something that was unimaginable to people then.Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet. We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco. And we have the elves in the form of China. But we don't appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been.And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now, as we look forward about where we're going to go. And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual, that the future will be like the present, just more of it. But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea that is increasingly coming into question. And in terms of climate change, is something that is not actually feasible.There is the idea of hitting the wall, that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse. This is a popular story in some places. The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything, that technology can somehow get us through this completely.And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks, the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis, that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints, the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side, the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world.But the world isn't Second Life. We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse. And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other, there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals to make all of those things. The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances, usually at the expense of the local, more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past, which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.We can be astonishingly inventive and creative. But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands. Energy and technology are not the same thing. What I'm involved with is the transition response. And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face, and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need. It's something which has spread incredibly fast. And it is something which has several characteristics.It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly. It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it. It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are. It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do where they are, to respond to this. It's sensitive to place and to scale.Transitional is completely different. Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here, what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to. It learns very much from its mistakes. And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary. And it's a process which is really joyful. People have a huge amount of fun doing this, reconnecting with other people as they do it. One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability. The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology. And it's really about how systems, settlements, withstand shock from the outside. When they encounter shock from the outside that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces. And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in. Looking through the lens of resilience, we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation that's so vulnerable. Resilience runs much deeper: it's about building modularity into what we do, building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association, in 1897. This is at a time when the city of Bristol, which is quite close to here, was surrounded by commercial market gardens, which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well. There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time, which we can now only look back on with envy.So how does this transition idea work? So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea. They pick up some of the tools that we've developed. They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town. They show films, they give talks, and so on. It's a process which is playful and creative and informative. Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this, and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable.So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland, where I was teaching, and has since spread. There are now over 200 formal transition projects. And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage. They are mulling whether they're going to take it further. And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff. But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea, but what do they actually do on the ground?Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own. We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on. We need national responses. We need local government responses. But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable, over the next 5 to 10 years.Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects, like community-supported agriculture schemes, urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on. A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies, community-owned energy companies, where the community can invest money into itself, to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need. A lot of places are working with their local schools. Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food. Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore. Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces. And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy. You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything. But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town. Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on. What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody? As a friend of mine says, \"Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.\" And that's certainly been my experience with transition. From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world. We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband, the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener. Which he did \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities, Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud, the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan. And the head of the council said, \"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time.\" As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this. And we see it all over the place as well now. But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now, but that things are already inevitably changing, and what we need to do is to work creatively with that, based on asking the right questions.I think I'd like to just return at the end to the idea of stories. Because I think stories are vital here. And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here. And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing. Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company. And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done, when Eleanor Roosevelt did it, it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is \u2014 for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil. I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky. But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point. Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable. And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us, and that the Oil Age has done for us, we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient, more nourishing, and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled and more connected to each other. Thank you very much.

00:01:44.958\nThis bottle of oil,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\ndistilled over a hundred million years of geological time,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nancient sunlight,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ncontains the energy equivalent of about five weeks\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nhard human manual labor --\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nequivalent to about 35 strong people\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\ncoming round and working for you.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nWe can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nmedicine, modern clothing,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nlaptops, a whole range of different things.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nIt gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWe've based the design of our settlements,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nour business models, our transport plans,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\neven the idea of economic growth, some would argue,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\non the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nYet, when we take a step back,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand look over the span of history,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nat what we might call the petroleum interval,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nit's a short period in history\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nwhere we've discovered this extraordinary material,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nand then based a whole way of life around it.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nBut as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwe move from a time where our economic success,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nour sense of individual prowess and well-being\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nis directly linked to how much of this we consume,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nto a time when actually our degree of oil dependency\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nis our degree of vulnerability.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd it's increasingly clear that we\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\naren't going to be able to rely on the fact that\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwe're going to have this at our disposal forever.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nFor every four barrels of oil that we consume,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwe only discover one.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd that gap continues to widen.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThere is also the fact that the amount of energy\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthat we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIn the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nfor every one that we put in to extract it.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nCompletely unprecedented, historically.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAlready that's fallen to about 11.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd that's why, now,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthe new breakthroughs, the new frontiers\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nin terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nor at the bottom of the oceans.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThere are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nBut of those, 65 have already passed their peak.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThe moment when the world on average passes this peak,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\npeople wonder when that's going to happen.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd there is an emerging case\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat maybe that was what happened last July\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwhen the oil prices were so high.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut are we to assume that the same brilliance\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand creativity and adaptability\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nis somehow mysteriously going to evaporate\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwhen we have to design a creative way back down the other side?\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nNo. But the thinking that we have to come up with\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nhas to be based on a realistic assessment\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nof where we are.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThere is also the issue of climate change,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nis the other thing that underpins this transition approach.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nas the data that's coming in,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhich is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo the IPCC said\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthat we might see significant breakup\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nof the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nActually, if current trends continue,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nit could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIf just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nis released as the world warms,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nit would offset all the savings that we need to make,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nin carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nWe have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nBut I'm always very interested to think about\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nwhat might the stories be\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nthat the generations further down the slope from us\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nare going to tell about us.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n\"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthat partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance.\"\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd one of the ways I like to do that\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nis to look back at the stories people used to tell\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbefore we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nor a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nWe had stories like \"The Seven-League Boots\":\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nthe giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwith every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\na kind of travel completely unimaginable\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto people without that kind of energy at their disposal.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nStories like The Magic Porridge Pot,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nwhere you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthis pot would just make as much food as you liked,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nwithout you having to do any work,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nprovided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nOtherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThere is the story of \"The Elves and the Shoemaker.\"\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThe people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand all the shoes are magically made for them.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nIt's something that was unimaginable to people then.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nNow we have the seven-league boots\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nWe have the magic porridge pot\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nin the form of Walmart and Tesco.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd we have the elves in the form of China.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut we don't appreciate what an astonishing\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthing that has been.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nas we look forward about where we're going to go.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nAnd I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthat the future will be like the present, just more of it.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBut as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthat is increasingly coming into question.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd in terms of climate change,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nis something that is not actually feasible.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThere is the idea of hitting the wall,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat actually somehow everything is so fragile\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthat it might just all unravel and collapse.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThis is a popular story in some places.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThe third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthat technology can somehow get us through this completely.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthe idea that we can invent our way out of a profound\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\neconomic and energy crisis,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthat a move to a knowledge economy\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\ncan somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthe idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat will mean we can sweep all concerns\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nabout energy security to one side,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nthe idea that we can step off neatly\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nonto a completely renewable world.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut the world isn't Second Life.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWe can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nthere are still people mining coal\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nin order to power the servers, extracting the minerals\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nto make all of those things.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe breakfast that we eat as we sit down\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto check our email in the morning\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nis still transported at great distances,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nusually at the expense of the local, more resilient\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nfood systems that would have supplied that in the past,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nwhich we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nWe can be astonishingly inventive and creative.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nEnergy and technology are not the same thing.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWhat I'm involved with is the transition response.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd this is really about looking the challenges\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof peak oil and climate change square in the face,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand responding with a creativity and an adaptability\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand an imagination that we really need.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nIt's something which has spread incredibly fast.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd it is something which has several characteristics.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nIt's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIt's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\ndevelops and passes on as they work with it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIt's self-organizing. There is no great central organization\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthat pushes this; people just pick up an idea\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand they run with it, and they implement it where they are.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nwhere they are, to respond to this.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt's sensitive to place and to scale.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nTransitional is completely different.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nTransition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nwhat they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nIt learns very much from its mistakes.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nAnd it feels historic. It tries to create a sense\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat this is a historic opportunity\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto do something really extraordinary.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd it's a process which is really joyful.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nPeople have a huge amount of fun doing this,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nreconnecting with other people as they do it.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nOne of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nis a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nThe idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd it's really about how systems,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nsettlements, withstand shock from the outside.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nWhen they encounter shock from the outside\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nthat they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nWhen our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nat any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nthe energy efficiency of the freezers\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nLooking through the lens of resilience,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwe really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthat's so vulnerable.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nResilience runs much deeper:\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nit's about building modularity into what we do,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nbuilding surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nThis is a photograph of the Bristol and District\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nMarket Gardeners Association, in 1897.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThis is at a time when the city of Bristol,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nwhich is quite close to here,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwas surrounded by commercial market gardens,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwhich provided a significant amount of the food\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nthat was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThere was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nwhich we can now only look back on with envy.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo how does this transition idea work?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nSo basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThey pick up some of the tools that we've developed.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThey start to run an awareness-raising program\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nlooking at how this might actually work in the town.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nThey show films, they give talks, and so on.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nIt's a process which is playful and creative\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand informative.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThen they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhich then the transition project itself\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nstarts to support and enable.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nSo it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nwhere I was teaching, and has since spread.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nThere are now over 200 formal transition projects.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThey are mulling whether they're going to take it further.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nBut what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nbut what do they actually do on the ground?\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWell, I think it's really important to make the point that actually\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nyou know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWe need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe need national responses. We need local government responses.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut all of those things are going to be much easier\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nif we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nover the next 5 to 10 years.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSome of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nlike community-supported agriculture schemes,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nurban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nA lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ncommunity-owned energy companies,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nwhere the community can invest money into itself,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nto start putting in place\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nthe kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nA lot of places are working with their local schools.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nNewent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nthe kids are learning how to grow food.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nPromoting recycling, things like garden-share,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nthat matches up people who don't have a garden\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwho would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nPlanting productive trees throughout urban spaces.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nAnd also starting to play around with the idea of\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nalternative currencies.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThis is Lewes in Sussex,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwho have recently launched the Lewes Pound,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\na currency that you can only spend within the town,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nas a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nYou take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nBut actually within the town you start to create these economic\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\ncycles much more effectively.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nAnother thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwhich is basically to develop a plan B for the town.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nMost of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nfor the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nstill start by assuming that there will be more energy,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nmore cars, more housing,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nmore jobs, more growth, and so on.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWhat does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nand actually come up with something that was actually more likely\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nto sustain everybody?\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAs a friend of mine says, \"Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd that's certainly been my experience with transition.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nFrom three years ago, it just being an idea,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nthis has become something that has virally swept around the world.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nWe're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nthe energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nas a keynote listener.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWhich he did --\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nand has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThere are now two local authorities in this country\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nwho have declared themselves transitional local authorities,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nLeicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthe transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd the head of the council said,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\n\"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nall of that community infrastructure for the first time.\"\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nAs we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIn Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nhas funded Transition Scotland\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nas a national organization supporting the spread of this.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd we see it all over the place as well now.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nBut the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nbut that things are already inevitably changing,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand what we need to do is to work creatively with that,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nbased on asking the right questions.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nI think I'd like to just return at the end\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nto the idea of stories.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nBecause I think stories are vital here.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd actually the stories that we tell ourselves,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwe have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd one of the key things that transition does\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nis to pull those stories out of what people are doing.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nStories about the community that's produced\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nits own 21 pound note, for example,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe school that's turned its car park into a food garden,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nthe community that's founded its own energy company.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd for me, one of the great stories recently\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwas the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nto create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nwhen Eleanor Roosevelt did it,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nit led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nSo the question I'd like to leave you with, really,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nis -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nin order to thrive,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nhow can it be done in such a way\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nthat drastically reduces its carbon emissions,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nwhile also building resilience?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nPersonally, I feel enormously grateful\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nto have lived through the age of cheap oil.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nI've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nBut let us honor what it has bought us,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nand move forward from this point.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nBecause if we cling to it, and continue to assume\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthat it can underpin our choices,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nthe future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nAnd by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand that the Oil Age has done for us,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nwe are able to then begin the creation\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nof a world which is more resilient,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nmore nourishing,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nand in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nand more connected to each other.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Turning dunes into architecture", "duration": "703", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/magnus_larsson_turning_dunes_into_architecture", "transcript": "It's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen, and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer-long wall across the entire African continent. About the size of the Great Wall of China, this would hardly be an invisible structure. And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye: bacteria and grains of sand.Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems. But I don't really believe in architectural problems; I only believe in opportunities. Which is why I'll show you a threat, and an architectural response. The threat is desertification. My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand, stretching across the desert.Now, sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions. It is simple and complex. It is peaceful and violent. It is always the same, never the same, endlessly fascinating. One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second. That's a cyclical process. As rocks and mountains die, grains of sand are born. Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone. And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free. Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale, into a sand dune.In a way, the static, stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand. But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why. Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces. Some are already deserts; others are being seriously degraded by the sand. Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel. The name means \"edge of the desert.\" And this is the region most closely associated with desertification. It was here in the late '60s and early '70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid, with about up to 250,000 dying.This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again. And it's one that gets very little attention. In our accelerated media culture, desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines. It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina: too few crying children and smashed up houses. And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents, affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people, and especially in Africa and China. And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources. So, we get climate change. We get droughts, increased desertification, crashing food systems, water scarcity, famine, forced migration, political instability, warfare, crisis. That's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously. But, how far away is it?I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is. The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year. That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land, physically pushing people away from their homes. Here I am \u2014 I'm the second person on the left \u2014 (Laughter) with the elders in Gidan-Kara, a tiny village outside of Sokoto.They had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it. So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut. This is where the village used to be. It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune, which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location. That's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to. If you happen to live close to the desert border, you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away, and abandon your home and your life as you know it.Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts. And still, those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands. Four years ago, 23 African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara. A fantastic project, the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent, from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east. If you want to stop a sand dune from moving, what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest. And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way, is to use some kind of sand catcher. Trees or cacti are good for this. But, one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood.Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down. This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things. It adds roughness to the dune's surface, to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains. It provides a physical support structure for the trees, and it creates physical spaces, habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes. If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees, protect them from humans, and from some of the forces of nature. Inside of the dunes we find shade. We can start harvesting condensation, and start greening the desert from within.Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way. All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid, and then excavate the sand, and we have our architecture. We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us. So, the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.But, by now, you're probably asking, how am I planning to solidify a sand dune? How do we glue those grains of sand together? And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys, Bacillus pasteurii, a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes, and does precisely that. It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it. These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand, and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains. A chemical process produces calcite, which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together. The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours. I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong. He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes. Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist, working with the bugs at UCL in London, trying to solidify them.So, how much would this cost? I'm not an economist, very much not, but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars. And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria, which you'll never have to pay again, one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars.How do we construct something like this? Well, I'll quickly show you two options. The first is to create a kind of balloon structure, fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon, pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it. Then, a few years afterwards, using permacultural strategies, we green that part of the desert.The second alternative would be to use injection piles. So, we pushed the piles down through the dune, and we create an initial bacterial surface. We then pull the piles up through the dune and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up. So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone, and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.But, what should they look like? Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni, which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it. These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto. And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me with good spatial qualities, for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things. Now, part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature, obviously, as the bacteria do their work. And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually. I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice. We see the result, the traces, if you like, of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments.Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably, and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way. That's not true at all. It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today, and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them. So, there it is \u2014 architectural anti-desertification structures made from the desert itself. Sand-stopping devices, made from sand. The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century. In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous. And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion. But, if I had something like a TED wish, it would be to actually get it built, to start building this habitable wall, this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert, built into the dunescape itself. It's not only something that supports trees, but something that connects people and countries together. I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure, and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.Borges said that \"nothing is built on stone, everything is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand were stone.\"Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme \u2014 political, practical, ethical, financial. My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole, is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world. But, it's a beginning, it's a vision. As Borges would have it, it's the sand. And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone. Thank you.

here in the late '60s and early '70s\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat major droughts brought three million people\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nto become dependent upon emergency food

countries\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIt seriously threatens the livelihoods\n\n00:02:56.958 -->

this seriously.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nBut, how far away is it?\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nto try and find out how far away it is.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThe dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThat's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nphysically pushing people away from their homes.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nHere I am -- I'm the second person on the left

00:04:00.958\nThey had to move this village in 1987\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nas a huge dune threatened to swallow it.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nThis is where the village used to be.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIt took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwhich goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThat's the kind of forced migration\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthat desertification can lead to.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIf you happen to live close to the desert border,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nyou can pretty much calculate how long it will be\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nbefore you have to carry your kids away,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand abandon your home and your life as you know it.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nNow, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd still, those extreme environments are very good places\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nif we want to stop the shifting

does precisely that.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nIt takes a pile of loose sand\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand it creates sandstone out of it.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThese

00:07:10.958\nI learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHe managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nHere I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nworking with the bugs at UCL in London,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\ntrying to solidify them.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo, how much would this cost?\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm not an economist, very much not,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbut I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nwe would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwhich you'll never have to pay again,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\none cubic meter of bacterial sand\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwould be about 11 dollars.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nHow do we construct something like this?\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWell, I'll quickly show you two options.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nThe first is to create a kind of balloon structure,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nfill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\npop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThen, a few years afterwards,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nusing permacultural strategies,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nwe green that part of the desert.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nThe second alternative would be to use injection piles.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo, we pushed the piles down through the dune,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand we create an initial bacterial surface.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nWe then pull the piles up through the dune\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwith the sand acting as a mold as we go up.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nBut, what should they look like?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWell, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nwhich look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThese are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nwith good spatial qualities,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nfor ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nNow, part of the formal control over this structure\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nwould be lost to nature, obviously,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nas the bacteria do their work.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nAnd I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI think there is really something in that articulation\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nthat is quite nice.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nWe see the result, the traces, if you like,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nof the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\ninto these habitable environments.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nSome people believe that\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthis would spread uncontrollably,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThat's not true at all.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nIt's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nand the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo, there it is --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\narchitectural anti-desertification structures\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nmade from the desert itself.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSand-stopping devices, made from sand.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThe world is likely to lose one third of its arable land\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nby the end of the century.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIn a period of unprecedented population growth\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nIf nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut, if I had something like a TED wish,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nit would be to actually get it built,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto start building this habitable wall,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nthis very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbuilt into the dunescape itself.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIt's not only something that supports trees,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nbut something that connects people and countries together.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nI would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nBorges said that \"nothing is built on stone,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\neverything is built on sand,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nbut we must build as if the sand were stone.\"\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nNow, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.958\npolitical, practical, ethical, financial.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nMy design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nis fraught with many challenges\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand difficulties in the real world.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nBut, it's a beginning, it's a vision.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAs Borges would have it, it's the sand.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd I think now is really the time\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nto turn it into stone. Thank you.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Dance to change the world", "duration": "1012", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/mallika_sarabhai", "transcript": "One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest. Under a tree she saw a woman meditating furiously. The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri. She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin. To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree. Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened. (Claps) And the god Indra jumped into the clearing. Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri. Ah-hah. The woman paid him no heed. So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor, and proceeded to rape her. Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!) And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared. He realized at once what had happened. So, he petitioned the higher gods so that he may have justice. So, the god Vishnu arrived.\"Are there any witnesses?\"\"Just a one-eyed monkey,\" said the Brahmin.Now, the one-eyed monkey really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice, so she retold events exactly as they had happened. Vishnu gave his judgment.\"The god Indra has sinned, in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin. May he be called to wash away his sins.\"So, Indra arrived, and performed the sacrifice of the horse. And so it transpired that a horse was killed, a god was made sin-free, a Brahmin's ego was appeased, a woman ... was ruined, and a one-eyed monkey was left ... very confused at what we humans call justice.In India there is a rape every three minutes. In India, only 25 percent of rapes come to a police station, and of these 25 percent that come to a police station, convictions are only in four percent of the cases. That's a lot of women who don't get justice.And it's not only about women. Look around you, look at your own countries. There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes. If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail. If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis, our tribals, the Naxalites. If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks. There is a trend here. And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story, always get to tell their truth as The Truth. So, have we all become one-eyed \u2014 two-eyed instead of one-eyed \u2014 monkeys? Have we stopped seeing injustice?Good morning. (Applause) You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something. Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, \"I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,\" they would say, \"Thank you very much, we have other things to do.\" And that is the astonishing power of art.Art can go through where other things can't. You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, \"I am this, I am that, I am that.\" No. It breaks through those. And it reaches somewhere where other things don't. And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through.Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan. And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth. And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts.For me it came very early. When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her. It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families. And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw. He came to talk to her and said, \"What is this about?\" She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance. Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in \"The Mahabharata\" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences. Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, \"Hey girl, that's it!\" And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say, \"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais \u00e7a? \u00c7a!\" And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, \"This is it!\" And I thought, \"This is what we need, as a language.\"We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health. Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year. And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation. So, what do they do? They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die. And governments have not been able to provide clean water. They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen. And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford. So what do you do? Do you let them die?Well, somebody had a great idea. And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody but would help health in every field. Most houses in Asia and India have a cotton garment. And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this, that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over, can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through. So, why aren't governments blaring this on television? Why isn't it on every poster across the third world? Because there is no profit in it. Because nobody can get a kickback. But it still needs to get to people. And here is one of the ways we get it to people.[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.Man: You know how expensive those are. I have a solution that requires neither machine, nor wood, nor cooking gas.Woman: What solution?Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.Woman: All right, father.Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)Man: One, two, three, four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take.Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make. All the germs from the water we take. Five, six, seven, eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make. Five, six, seven, eight folds we make. Our drinking water safe we make.Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.Man: So this is the cotton sari. And through this we will have clean water.(Applause)I think it's safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives. While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution, and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders, we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage, or whether it's domestic violence, whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere. So, why are we not doing something to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?What are we doing to try and make children and young people realize that violence is something that we indulge in, that we can stop, and that there are other ways of actually taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations into different things that do not harm other people. Well, here is one such way.(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people. Your parents were peaceful people. Your grandparents were peaceful people. So much peace in one place? How could it be otherwise?(Music)But, what if ... Yes. What if ... One little gene in you has been trying to get through? From your beginnings in Africa, through each generation, may be passed on to you, in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you. And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.It's what made you smack your baby brother, stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother. It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide. Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear. And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean. Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection. Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will. Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it. You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T. Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln. Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi. Goodbye, Martin Luther King. Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood. Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food. Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century. Look what we've ... look what they've done. (Applause)Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues. A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change. In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal. And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done. And of course, \"The Vagina Monologues\" we know about. And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people? What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, \"You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake. It needs to be the yeast.\" Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there. And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need? We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is. And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed. There are more people being raped. There are more wars. There are more people dying of simple things. So, something has got to give. And that is what I want. Can I have my last audio track please?Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully. (Whistling) Her father the king said, \"Don't whistle.\" Her mother the queen said, \"Hai, don't whistle.\" But the princess continued whistling. (Whistling)The years went by and the princess grew up into a beautiful young woman, who whistled even more beautifully. (Whistling) Her father the king said, \"Who will marry a whistling princess?\" Her mother the queen said, \"Who will marry a whistling princess?\"But the king had an idea. He announced a Swayamvara. He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling. \"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom and her hand in marriage!\" Soon the palace filled with princes whistling. (Whistling) Some whistled badly. Some whistled well. But nobody could defeat the princess.\"Now what shall we do?\" said the king. \"Now what shall we do?\" said the queen. But the princess said, \"Father, Mother, don't worry. I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men and I am going to ask them if they defeated correctly. And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish.\"So she went up to each and said, \"Do you accept that I have defeated you?\" And they said, \"Me? Defeated by a woman? No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible.\" Till finally one prince said, \"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me.\" \"Uh-huh ...\" she said. \"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife.\" (Whistling)Thank you.

I am going to go to each of these young men\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand I am going to ask them\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nif they defeated correctly.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nAnd if somebody answers, that shall be my wish.\"\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo she went up to each and said, \"Do you accept that I have defeated you?\"\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd they said, \"Me?

That's not possible.\"\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nTill finally one prince said,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\n\"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me.\"\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n\"Uh-huh ...\" she said.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\n\"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife.\"\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:25.958\n(Whistling)\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Why nations should pursue soft power", "duration": "1073", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shashi_tharoor", "transcript": "As an Indian, and now as a politician and a government minister, I've become rather concerned about the hype we're hearing about our own country, all this talk about India becoming a world leader, even the next superpower. In fact, the American publishers of my book, \"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,\" added a gratuitous subtitle saying, \"India: The next 21st-century power.\" And I just don't think that's what India's all about, or should be all about.Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic. It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads. After all, what constitutes a world leader? If it's population, we're on course to top the charts. We will overtake China by 2034. Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army. Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that. The Americans have even recognized it, in an agreement. Is it the economy? Well, we have now the fifth-largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms. And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year, we grew at 6.7 percent.But, somehow, none of that adds up to me, to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world, in this part of the 21st century. And so I wondered, could what the future beckons for India to be all about be a combination of these things allied to something else, the power of example, the attraction of India's culture, what, in other words, people like to call \"soft power.\"Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic, Joseph Nye, a friend of mine. And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here, it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others because of its culture, its political values, its foreign policies. And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States, but we know the Alliance Francaise is all about French soft power, the British Council. The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power. Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships. But, the fact is, in fact, that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds have done more for American soft power around the world than any specifically government activity.So soft power is something that really emerges partly because of governments, but partly despite governments. And in the information era we all live in today, what we might call the TED age, I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged by a global public that's been fed on an incessant diet of Internet news, of televised images, of cellphone videos, of email gossip. In other words, all sorts of communication devices are telling us the stories of countries, whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.Now, in this age, again, countries with access to multiple channels of communication and information have a particular advantage. And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen. India has more all-news TV channels than any country in the world, in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.But, the fact still is that it's not just that. In order to have soft power, you have to be connected. One might argue that India has become an astonishingly connected country. I think you've already heard the figures. We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month. Currently there are 509 million cellphones in Indian hands, in India. And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market. In fact, those 15 million cellphones are the most connections that any country, including the U.S. and China, has ever established in the history of telecommunications.But, what perhaps some of you don't realize is how far we've come to get there. You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rarity. In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy. If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone. But sometimes it just sat there.I went to high school in Calcutta. And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer. But half the time we would pick it up with an expectant look on our faces, there would be no dial tone. If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number, the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach. In fact the words \"wrong number\" were more popular than the word \"Hello.\" (Laughter) If you then wanted to connect to another city, let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi, you'd have to book something called a trunk call, and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through. Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call. But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days, so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.In fact, so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this. And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in India.Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see: the 15 million cell phones a month. But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones. You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi, on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century, wielding a coal-fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century. He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument. He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free, and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood, to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend, about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban. And it was a hot day and he said, \"Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?\" And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure. And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number, and a voice said, \"I'm up here.\" And right on top of the nearest coconut tree, with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other, was a local toddy tapper, who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones. When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast to find out where they get the best possible prices. Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor to find out if the market town was open, if the market was on, whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch. They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge to the market town to get that information and come back, then they'd load the cart. Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.So this empowerment of the underclass is the real result of India being connected. And that transformation is part of where India is heading today. But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading. You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump \u2014 Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me \u2014 and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio. And the first goat, chewing away, says, \"You know, this film is not bad.\" And the second goat says, \"No, the book was better.\" (Laughter)I usually tend to think that the book is usually better, but, having said that, the fact is that Bollywood is now taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe, not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K., but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians. I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother in a village in Senegal takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar, just to watch a Bollywood movie. She can't understand the dialogue. She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles. But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps, and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action. She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.And this is happening more and more. Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world. India doesn't have a military mission there. You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years? One simple fact: you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening. Why? Because that was the moment when the Indian television soap opera, \"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi,\" dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V. And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history. Every Afghan family wanted to watch it. They had to suspend functions at 8:30. Weddings were reported to be interrupted so guests could cluster around the T.V. set, and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom. Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch \u2014 so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency \u2014 about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif* stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers, its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors, any moving part they could find, at 8:30, because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store. And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine, \"Tulsi Zindabad\": \"Long live Tulsi.\" (Laughter)That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the \"E\" part of TED: its own entertainment industry. The same is true, of course \u2014 we don't have time for too many more examples \u2014 but it's true of our music, of our dance, of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine. I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s, and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one. But, today in Britain, for example, Indian restaurants in Britain employ more people than the coal mining, ship building and iron and steel industries combined. So the empire can strike back. (Applause)But, with this increasing awareness of India, with you and with I, and so on, with tales like Afghanistan, comes something vital in the information era, the sense that in today's world it's not the side of the bigger army that wins, it's the country that tells a better story that prevails. And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story. Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S. as a student in the mid '70s, I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT. This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK. I had a friend, a history major like me, who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, by an anxiously perspiring European saying, \"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?\" (Laughter)We've gone from the image of India as land of fakirs lying on beds of nails, and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick, to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses, computer wizards, software gurus. But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world. But, there is something more substantive to that. The story rests on a fundamental platform of political pluralism. It's a civilizational story to begin with. Because India has been an open society for millennia. India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas, landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state, somewhere around 52 A.D., he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl. And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered a single incident of anti-semitism. (Applause) That's the Indian story. Islam came peacefully to the south, slightly more differently complicated history in the north. But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections, the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history. And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population keeps growing by 20 million a year. But, the fact is that the last elections, five years ago, gave the world extraordinary phenomenon of an election being won by a woman political leader of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi, who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh, to be sworn in as Prime Minister by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam, in a country 81 percent Hindu. (Applause)This is India, and of course it's all the more striking because it was four years later that we all applauded the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world, more than 220 years of free and fair elections, which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president who wasn't white, male or Christian. So, maybe \u2014 oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon \u2014 and he is male, but he isn't white. All the others have been all those three. (Laughter) All his predecessors have been all those three, and that's the point I was trying to make. (Laughter)But, the issue is that when I talked about that example, it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda. Because ultimately, that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world. It was essentially India being itself. And ultimately, it seems to me, that always works better than propaganda. Governments aren't very good at telling stories. But people see a society for what it is, and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era, in today's TED age.So India now is no longer the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion, because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically, we've every religion know to mankind, with the possible exception of Shintoism, though that has some Hindu elements somewhere. We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution. And those of you who cashed your money here might be surprised to see how many scripts there are on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations. We've got all of that. We don't even have geography uniting us, because the natural geography of the subcontinent framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked by the partition with Pakistan in 1947. In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted, because the name \"India\" comes from the river Indus, which flows in Pakistan.But, the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea. It's the idea of an ever-ever-land, emerging from an ancient civilization, united by a shared history, but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy. That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one. And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter, and still rally around a consensus. And the consensus is of a very simple principle, that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time, so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree. The great success story of India, a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century. And I do want to make the point that if there is anything worth celebrating about India, it isn't military muscle, economic power. All of that is necessary, but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome. Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power. We can't really be both of those. We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the hardware of development, the ports, the roads, the airports, all the infrastructural things we need to do, and the software of development, the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India to be able to have a couple of square meals a day, to be able to send his or her children to a decent school, and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves.But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges, those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist. But, it's all taking place in an open society, in a rich and diverse and plural civilization, in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill the creative energies of its people. That's why India belongs at TED, and that's why TED belongs in India. Thank you very much.

Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nIs it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThe Americans have even recognized it,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nin an agreement.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nIs it the economy? Well, we have now\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe fifth-largest economy in the world\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nin purchasing power parity terms.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nwe grew at 6.7 percent.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBut, somehow, none of that adds up to me,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nto what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nin this part of the 21st century.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd so I wondered, could\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nwhat the future beckons for India to be all about\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nbe a combination of these things allied to something else,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthe power of example,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nthe attraction of India's culture,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwhat, in other words, people like to call \"soft power.\"\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nSoft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nJoseph Nye, a friend of mine.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nit's essentially the ability of a country to attract others\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nbecause of its culture, its political values,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nits foreign policies.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nAnd, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nbut we know the Alliance Francaise\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nis all about French soft power, the British Council.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThe Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAmericans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nBut, the fact is, in fact,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nthat probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nhave done more for American soft power\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\naround the world than any specifically government activity.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo soft power is something that really emerges\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\npartly because of governments,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbut partly despite governments.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd in the information era we all live in today,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwhat we might call the TED age,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nI'd say that countries are increasingly being judged\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nby a global public that's been fed\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\non an incessant diet of Internet news,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nof televised images,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nof cellphone videos, of email gossip.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nIn other words, all sorts of communication devices\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nare telling us the stories of countries,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nNow, in this age, again, countries with access\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nto multiple channels of communication\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nand information have a particular advantage.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nIndia has more all-news TV channels\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthan any country in the world,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nin fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut, the fact still is that it's not just that.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIn order to have soft power, you have to be connected.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nOne might argue that India has become\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nan astonishingly connected country.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nI think you've already heard the figures.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nWe've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nCurrently there are 509 million cellphones\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nin Indian hands, in India.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIn fact, those 15 million cellphones\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nare the most connections that any country,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nincluding the U.S. and China,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nhas ever established in the history of telecommunications.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut, what perhaps some of you don't realize\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis how far we've come to get there.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nYou know, when I grew up in India,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\ntelephones were a rarity.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nhad the right to allocate 15 telephone lines\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nas a favor to those they deemed worthy.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIf you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nor an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nBut sometimes it just sat there.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI went to high school in Calcutta.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut half the time we would pick it up\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwith an expectant look on our faces,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nthere would be no dial tone.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nIf there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nIn fact the words \"wrong number\" were more popular than the word \"Hello.\"\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIf you then wanted to connect to another city,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nlet's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou'd have to book something called a trunk call,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nOr you could pay eight times the going rate\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfor something called a lightning call.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nBut, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nso, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIn fact, so woeful was our telephone service\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nthat a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthat in a developing country\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\ncommunications are a luxury, not a right,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nthat the government had no obligation to provide better service,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\ncould he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nfor telephones in India.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nNow, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthe 15 million cell phones a month.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nYou know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\non the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat looks like it was designed in the 16th century,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nwielding a coal-fired steam iron\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat might have been invented in the 18th century.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nHe's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nHe's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nto know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe other day I was in Kerala, my home state,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nat the country farm of a friend,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nabout 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd it was a hot day and he said, \"Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?\"\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\non a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand a voice said, \"I'm up here.\"\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd right on top of the nearest coconut tree,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwith a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwas a local toddy tapper,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nwho proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nFishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWhen they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nto find out where they get the best possible prices.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nFarmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nto find out if the market town was open,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nif the market was on,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwhether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThey'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nto the market town to get that information and come back,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthen they'd load the cart.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nToday they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nSo this empowerment of the underclass\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis the real result of India being connected.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd that transformation is part of where India is heading today.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nBut, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nYou've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nMr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nand they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd the first goat, chewing away, says, \"You know, this film is not bad.\"\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd the second goat says, \"No, the book was better.\"\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI usually tend to think that the book is usually better,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nbut, having said that,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthe fact is that Bollywood is now\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:52.958\ntaking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nnot just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nbut to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nI've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nin a village in Senegal\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\ntakes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\njust to watch a Bollywood movie.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nShe can't understand the dialogue.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nShe's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nBut these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nand she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nShe goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd this is happening more and more.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAfghanistan, we know what a serious security problem\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAfghanistan is for so many of us in the world.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nIndia doesn't have a military mission there.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nYou know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nOne simple fact:\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nyou couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhy? Because that was the moment\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwhen the Indian television soap opera,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:53.958\n\"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi,\" dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nEvery Afghan family wanted to watch it.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThey had to suspend functions at 8:30.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nWeddings were reported to be interrupted\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nso guests could cluster around the T.V. set,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nCrime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nso this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nabout how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nstripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nits hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nany moving part they could find, at 8:30,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nbecause the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\n\"Tulsi Zindabad\": \"Long live Tulsi.\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThat's soft power. And that is what India is developing\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthrough the \"E\" part of TED:\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nits own entertainment industry.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThe same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbut it's true of our music, of our dance,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nof our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nI mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nsince I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut, today in Britain, for example,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIndian restaurants in Britain\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nemploy more people than the coal mining,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nship building and iron and steel industries combined.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo the empire can strike back.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:27.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut, with this increasing awareness of India,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwith you and with I, and so on,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nwith tales like Afghanistan,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\ncomes something vital in the information era,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthe sense that in today's world\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit's not the side of the bigger army that wins,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nit's the country that tells a better story that prevails.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nStereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nas a student in the mid '70s,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nI knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nToday, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nspeak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwith the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThis can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nI had a friend, a history major like me,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwho was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nby an anxiously perspiring European saying,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n\"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?\"\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nWe've gone from the image of India as\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nland of fakirs lying on beds of nails,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nto the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\ncomputer wizards, software gurus.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nBut that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nBut, there is something more substantive to that.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThe story rests on a fundamental platform\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nof political pluralism.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIt's a civilizational story to begin with.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nBecause India has been an open society for millennia.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nIndia gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nby the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nIn fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nlanded on the shores of Kerala, my home state,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nsomewhere around 52 A.D.,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nhe was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nin the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\na single incident of anti-semitism.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThat's the Indian story.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIslam came peacefully to the south,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nslightly more differently complicated history in the north.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nBut all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nYou know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nthe biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nkeeps growing by 20 million a year.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut, the fact is\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthat the last elections, five years ago,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\ngave the world extraordinary phenomenon\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nof an election being won by a woman political leader\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nof Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwho then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nto be sworn in as Prime Minister\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nby a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nin a country 81 percent Hindu.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nThis is India, and of course it's all the more striking\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nbecause it was four years later that we all applauded\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nthe U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nmore than 220 years of free and fair elections,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwhich took till last year to elect a president or a vice president\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nwho wasn't white, male or Christian.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nSo, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand he is male, but he isn't white.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAll the others have been all those three.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAll his predecessors have been all those three,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand that's the point I was trying to make.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBut, the issue is\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthat when I talked about that example,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nit's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nBecause ultimately, that electoral outcome\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nhad nothing to do with the rest of the world.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nIt was essentially India being itself.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd ultimately, it seems to me,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthat always works better than propaganda.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nGovernments aren't very good at telling stories.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nBut people see a society for what it is,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand that, it seems to me, is what ultimately\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nwill make a difference in today's information era,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nin today's TED age.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo India now is no longer\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthe nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbecause we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwe've every religion know to mankind,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nwith the possible exception of Shintoism,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nthough that has some Hindu elements somewhere.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nWe have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd those of you who cashed your money here\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nmight be surprised to see how many scripts there are\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\non the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWe've got all of that.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe don't even have geography uniting us,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nbecause the natural geography of the subcontinent\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nframed by the mountains and the sea was hacked\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nby the partition with Pakistan in 1947.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nIn fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nbecause the name \"India\" comes from the river Indus,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nwhich flows in Pakistan.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nBut, the whole point is that India\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nis the nationalism of an idea.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nIt's the idea of an ever-ever-land,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nemerging from an ancient civilization,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nunited by a shared history,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nbut sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nThat is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nAnd it's the nationalism of an idea that\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nessentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:47.958\ncolor, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nand still rally around a consensus.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nAnd the consensus is of a very simple principle,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nthat in a diverse plural democracy like India\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nyou don't really have to agree on everything all the time,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nso long as you agree on the ground rules\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nof how you will disagree.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nThe great success story of India,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\na country that so many learned scholars and journalists\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nassumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nis that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nNow, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd I do want to make the point\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthat if there is anything worth celebrating about India,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nit isn't military muscle, economic power.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAll of that is necessary,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nbut we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nSomebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWe can't really be both of those.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nWe have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nhardware of development,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nthe ports, the roads, the airports,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nall the infrastructural things we need to do,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nand the software of development,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nthe human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nto be able to have a couple of square meals a day,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nto be able to send his or her children\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nto a decent school,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nand to aspire to work a job\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nthat will give them opportunities in their lives\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nthat can transform themselves.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nBut, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nthose real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nBut, it's all taking place in an open society,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nin a rich and diverse and plural civilization,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nin one that is determined to liberate and fulfill\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nthe creative energies of its people.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nThat's why India belongs at TED,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nand that's why TED belongs in India.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:44.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Global ethic vs. national interest", "duration": "1030", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gordon_brown_on_global_ethic_vs_national_interest", "transcript": "Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Prime Minister, that was both fascinating and quite inspiring. So, you're calling for a global ethic. Would you describe that as global citizenship? Is that an idea that you believe in, and how would you define that?Gordon Brown: It is about global citizenship and recognizing our responsibilities to others. There is so much to do over the next few years that is obvious to so many of us to build a better world. And there is so much shared sense of what we need to do, that it is vital that we all come together. But we don't necessarily have the means to do so.So there are challenges to be met. I believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents. But of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work. But I don't think we should underestimate the extent to which massive changes in technology make possible the linking up of people across the world.CA: But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship, but then they get confused a bit again when they start thinking about patriotism, and how to combine these two. I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister with a brief to bat for Britain. How do you reconcile the two things?GB: Well, of course national identity remains important. But it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities. And I think one of the problems of recession is that people become more protectionist, they look in on themselves, they try to protect their own nation, perhaps at the expense of other nations. When you actually look at the motor of the world economy, it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries. And any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years would deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits of growth in the world economy.So, you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism; that's absolutely important. But you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally, and the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone.CA: Well, indeed. But what do you do when the two come into conflict and you're forced to make a decision that either is in Britain's interest, or the interest of Britons, or citizens elsewhere in the world?GB: Well I think we can persuade people that what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests, what is necessary for America's long-term interests, is proper engagement with the rest of the world, and taking the action that is necessary.There is a great story, again, told about Richard Nixon. 1958, Ghana becomes independent, so it is just over 50 years ago. Richard Nixon goes to represent the United States government at the celebrations for independence in Ghana. And it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country. He doesn't quite know what to do, so he starts going around the crowd and starts talking to people and he says to people in this rather unique way, \"How does it feel to be free?\" And he's going around, \"How does it feel to be free?\" \"How does it feel to be free?\" And then someone says, \"How should I know? I come from Alabama.\"(Laughter)And that was the 1950s. Now, what is remarkable is that civil rights in America were achieved in the 1960s. But what is equally remarkable is socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast even since the age of colonialism. And yet, America and Africa have got a common interest. And we have got to realize that if we don't link up with those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa, to work together for common causes, then the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups making progress in Africa is very big.So, I would say that what seems sometimes to be altruism, in relation to Africa, or in relation to developing countries, is more than that. It is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries. And I would say that national interest and, if you like, what is the global interest to tackle poverty and climate change do, in the long run, come together. And whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change or on security, or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education, these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries.CA: I still just want to draw out on this issue. So, you're on vacation at a nice beach, and word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach. One end of the beach, there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians. And at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit. You have time to \u2014(Laughter)you have time to alert one house. What do you do?(Laughter)GB: Modern communications.(Applause)Alert both.(Applause)I do agree that my responsibility is first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe. And I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest that I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility that each leader has for their own country.But I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity open to us that was never open to us before. But the power to communicate across borders allows us to organize the world in a different way. And I think, look at the tsunami, it's a classic example. Where was the early warning systems? Where was the world acting together to deal with the problems that they knew arose from the potential for earthquakes, as well as the potential for climate change? And when the world starts to work together, with better early-warning systems, you can deal with some of these problems in a better way. I just think we're not seeing, at the moment, the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate in a world where either there was isolationism before or there was limited alliances based on convenience which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems.CA: But I think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot of people have, like people in the audience here, where we love the kind of language that you're talking about. It is inspiring. A lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future. And yet, when the situation changes, you suddenly hear politicians talking as if, you know, for example, the life of one American soldier is worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians. When the pedal hits the metal, the idealism can get moved away. I'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time, whether you see in Britain that there are changing attitudes, and that people are actually more supportive of the kind of global ethic that you talk about.GB: I think every religion, every faith, and I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion \u2014 it has this global ethic at the center of its credo. And whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim or whether it's Hindu, or whether it's Sikh, the same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions. So, I think you're dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense. So you're building on something that is not pure self-interest. You're building on people's ideas and values \u2014 that perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions. But it is a set of values that cannot, in my view, be extinguished.Then the question is, how do you make that change happen? How do you persuade people that it is in their interest to build strong \u2014 After the Second World War, we built institutions, the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the Marshall Plan. There was a period in which people talked about an act of creation, because these institutions were so new. But they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems. You can't deal with the environmental problem through existing institutions. You can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to. You can't deal with the economic and financial problem. So we have got to rebuild our global institutions, build them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time.And I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face, it is to persuade people to have the confidence that we can build a truly global society with the institutions that are founded on these rules. So, I come back to my initial point. Sometimes you think things are impossible. Nobody would have said 50 years ago that apartheid would have gone in 1990, or that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '80s and '90s, or that polio could be eradicated, or perhaps 60 years ago, nobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon. All these things have happened. By tackling the impossible, you make the impossible possible.CA: And we have had a speaker who said that very thing, and swallowed a sword right after that, which was quite dramatic.(Laughter)GB: Followed my sword and swallow.CA: But, surely a true global ethic is for someone to say, \"I believe that the life of every human on the planet is worth the same, equal consideration, regardless of nationality and religion.\" And you have politicians who have \u2014 you're elected. In a way, you can't say that. Even if, as a human being, you believe that, you can't say that. You're elected for Britain's interests.GB: We have a responsibility to protect. I mean look, 1918, the Treaty of Versailles, and all the treaties before that, the Treaty of Westphalia and everything else, were about protecting the sovereign right of countries to do what they want. Since then, the world has moved forward, partly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust, and people's concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection, partly because of what we saw in Rwanda, partly because of what we saw in Bosnia. The idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world.So, while I can't automatically say that Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country, in danger, I can say that Britain is in a position where we're working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack, is something that is accepted by the whole world.Now, in the end, that can only be achieved if your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so. And that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations, and what it can do, actually is. But, the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is, in a sense, taken over from the idea of self-determination as the principle governing the international community.CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes, a politician ever going out on a platform of the kind of full-form global ethic, global citizenship? And basically saying, \"I believe that all people across the planet have equal consideration, and if in power we will act in that way. And we believe that the people of this country are also now global citizens and will support that ethic.\"GB: Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change? We're saying that you cannot solve the problem of climate change in one country; you've got to involve all countries. You're saying that you must, and you have a duty to help those countries that cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves. You're saying you want a deal with all the different countries of the world where we're all bound together to cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world. We've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work. If you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed, A, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts, B, that there was short-range targets that had to be met so this wasn't just abstract; it was people actually making decisions now that would make a difference now, and if you could then find a financing mechanism that meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt by our inability to deal with climate change over many, many years and decades are given special help so that they can move to energy-efficient technologies, and they are in a position financially to be able to afford the long-term investment that is associated with cutting carbon emissions, then you are treating the world equally, by giving consideration to every part of the planet and the needs they have.It doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing, because we've actually got to do more financially to help the poorest countries, but it does mean there is equal consideration for the needs of citizens in a single planet.CA: Yes. And then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart by different countries fighting over their own individual interests.GB: Yes, but I think Europe has got a position, which is 27 countries have already come together. I mean, the great difficulty in Europe is if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak, it takes a very, very long time. But we did get an agreement on climate change. America has made its first disposition on this with the bill that President Obama should be congratulated for getting through Congress. Japan has made an announcement. China and India have signed up to the scientific evidence. And now we've got to move them to accept a long-term target, and then short-term targets. But more progress has been made, I think, in the last few weeks than had been made for some years.And I do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together, we can get that agreement to Copenhagen. I certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs. And we would help them adapt. And we would help them make the transition to a low-carbon economy.I do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this. When the IMF was created in the 1940s, it was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP. The IMF now has limited resources, one percent. It can't really make the difference that ought to be made in a period of crisis. So, we've got to rebuild the world institutions. And that's a big task: persuading all the different countries with the different voting shares in these institutions to do so.There is a story told about the three world leaders of the day getting a chance to get some advice from God. And the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God and he asked when there will be successful climate change and a low-carbon economy. And God shook his head and said, \"Not this year, not this decade, perhaps not even in [your] lifetime.\" And Bill Clinton walked away in tears because he had failed to get what he wanted.And then the story is that Barroso, the president of the European Commission, went to God and he asked, \"When will we get a recovery of global growth?\" And God said, \"Not this year, not in this decade, perhaps not in your lifetime.\" So Barroso walked away crying and in tears.And then the Secretary-General of the United Nations came up to speak to God and said, \"When will our international institutions work?\" And God cried.(Laughter)It is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions is the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves that there is a clear ethic upon which we can build.CA: Prime Minister, I think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into. And there are certainly many people in the audience who will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic.Thank you so much for coming to TED.GB: Well, thank you.(Applause)", "id": 700,

fundamentally,\n\n00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:24.934\nand the problems we have cannot be solved\nby one nation and one nation alone.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.095\nCA: Well, indeed.\n\n00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.434\nBut what do you do\nwhen the two come into conflict\n\n00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.459\nand you're forced to make a decision\n\n00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:35.934\nthat either is in Britain's interest,\nor the interest of Britons,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.317\nor citizens elsewhere in the world?\n\n00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.344\nGB: Well I think we can persuade people\n\n00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.934\nthat what is necessary\nfor Britain's long-term interests,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.387\nwhat is necessary\nfor America's long-term interests,\n\n00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.697\nis proper engagement\nwith the rest of the world,\n\n00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.628\nand taking the action that is necessary.\n\n00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:58.425\nThere is a great story, again,\ntold about Richard Nixon.\n\n00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:02.400\n1958, Ghana becomes independent,\n\n00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.212\nso it is just over 50 years ago.\n\n00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:08.822\nRichard Nixon goes to represent\nthe United States government\n\n00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:11.822\nat the celebrations\nfor independence in Ghana.\n\n00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:16.934\nAnd it's one of his first outings\nas Vice President to an African country.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.598\nHe doesn't quite know what to do,\n\n00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.371\nso he starts going around the crowd\n\n00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:21.934\nand starts talking to people\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.244\nand he says to people\nin this rather unique way,\n\n00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:26.485\n\"How does it feel to be free?\"\n\n00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.231\nAnd he's going around,\n\"How does it feel to be free?\"\n\n00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:30.842\n\"How does it feel to be free?\"\n\n00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:31.968\nAnd then someone says,\n\n00:03:31.992 --> 00:03:34.139\n\"How should I know? I come from Alabama.\"\n\n00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.362\nAnd that was the 1950s.\n\n00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:44.656\nNow, what is remarkable\n\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.401\nis that civil rights in America\nwere achieved in the 1960s.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.934\nBut what is equally remarkable\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:55.934\nis socioeconomic rights in Africa\nhave not moved forward very fast\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.299\neven since the age of colonialism.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.823\nAnd yet, America and Africa\nhave got a common interest.\n\n00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:05.934\nAnd we have got to realize\nthat if we don't link up\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.934\nwith those people who are sensible voices\nand democratic voices in Africa,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.934\nto work together for common causes,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.934\nthen the danger of Al Qaeda\nand related groups\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.934\nmaking progress in Africa is very big.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.934\nSo, I would say that what seems sometimes\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:23.776\nto be altruism, in relation to Africa,\nor in relation to developing countries,\n\n00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.949\nis more than that.\n\n00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:28.267\nIt is enlightened self-interest\nfor us to work with other countries.\n\n00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.141\nAnd I would say that national interest\n\n00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:32.274\nand, if you like,\nwhat is the global interest\n\n00:04:32.298 --> 00:04:34.378\nto tackle poverty and climate

safe.\n\n00:05:44.078 --> 00:05:47.388\nAnd I wouldn't like anything\nthat is said today to suggest\n\n00:05:47.412 --> 00:05:50.141\nthat I am diminishing the importance\nof the

00:06:03.379\nallows us to organize\nthe world in a different way.\n\n00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.482\nAnd I think, look at the tsunami,\nit's a classic example.\n\n00:06:07.506 --> 00:06:09.482\nWhere was the early warning systems?\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.744\nWhere was the world acting together\n\n00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:15.003\nto deal with the problems\nthat they knew arose\n\n00:06:15.027

never actually took you to deal\nwith some of the central problems.\n\n00:06:42.448 --> 00:06:44.426\nCA: But I think this is the frustration\n\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.670\nthat perhaps a lot of people have,\nlike people in the audience here,\n\n00:06:47.694 --> 00:06:50.583\nwhere we love the kind of language\nthat you're talking about.\n\n00:06:50.607 --> 00:06:51.616\nIt is inspiring.\n\n00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.934\nA lot of us believe\nthat that has to be the world's future.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.934\nAnd yet, when the situation changes,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.740\nyou suddenly hear\npoliticians talking as if,\n\n00:07:00.764 --> 00:07:03.934\nyou know, for example,\nthe life of one American soldier\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.614\nis worth

00:07:19.054\nI'm just wondering whether\nyou can see that changing over time,\n\n00:07:19.078 --> 00:07:20.934\nwhether you see in Britain\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.618\nthat there are changing attitudes,\n\n00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.771\nand that people are actually\nmore supportive\n\n00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:27.794\nof the kind of global ethic\nthat you talk about.\n\n00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.238\nGB: I think every religion, every faith,\n\n00:07:31.262 --> 00:07:34.367\nand I'm not just talking here\nto people of faith or religion --\n\n00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:38.018\nit has this global ethic\nat the center of its credo.\n\n00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:41.741\nAnd whether it's Jewish\nor whether it's Muslim\n\n00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:44.598\nor whether it's Hindu,\nor whether it's Sikh,\n\n00:07:44.622 --> 00:07:49.617\nthe same global ethic is at the heart\nof each of these religions.\n\n00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:51.934\nSo, I think you're dealing with something\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.749\nthat people instinctively\nsee as part of their moral sense.\n\n00:07:56.773 --> 00:08:00.535\nSo you're building on something\nthat is not pure self-interest.\n\n00:08:00.559 --> 00:08:04.536\nYou're building\non people's ideas and values --\n\n00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.227\nthat perhaps they're candles\nthat burn very dimly on certain occasions.\n\n00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:14.836\nBut it is a set of values that cannot,\nin my view, be extinguished.\n\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.415\nThen the question is,\n\n00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:19.097\nhow do you make that change happen?\n\n00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:23.009\nHow do you persuade people\nthat it is in their interest\n\n00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:24.772\nto build strong --\n\n00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:26.300\nAfter the Second World War,\n\n00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:29.301\nwe built institutions, the United Nations,\n\n00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:30.688\nthe IMF, the World Bank,\n\n00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:33.546\nthe World Trade Organization,\nthe Marshall Plan.\n\n00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.603\nThere was a period in which people\ntalked about an act of creation,\n\n00:08:37.627 --> 00:08:39.604\nbecause these institutions were so new.\n\n00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:42.739\nBut they are now out of date.\nThey don't deal with the problems.\n\n00:08:42.763 --> 00:08:44.898\nYou can't deal\nwith the environmental problem\n\n00:08:44.922 --> 00:08:46.397\nthrough existing institutions.\n\n00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:49.934\nYou can't deal with the security problem\nin the way that you need to.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.530\nYou can't deal with the economic\nand financial problem.\n\n00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:54.934\nSo we have got to rebuild\nour global institutions,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.177\nbuild them in a way that is suitable\nto the challenges of this time.\n\n00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.269\nAnd I believe that if you look\nat the biggest challenge we face,\n\n00:09:01.293 --> 00:09:03.935\nit is to persuade people\nto have the confidence\n\n00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.440\nthat we can build a truly global society\n\n00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:09.544\nwith the institutions\nthat are founded on these rules.\n\n00:09:09.568 --> 00:09:11.885\nSo, I come back to my initial point.\n\n00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.910\nSometimes you think things are impossible.\n\n00:09:13.934 -->

00:10:25.484\nSince then, the world has moved forward,\n\n00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:28.485\npartly as a result of what happened\nwith the Holocaust,\n\n00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:31.356\nand people's

00:14:23.585\nAnd I do believe\nthat there is a strong possibility\n\n00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:27.101\nthat if we work together, we can get\nthat agreement to Copenhagen.\n\n00:14:27.125 -->

we have taken into account\ntheir specific needs.\n\n00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:38.265\nAnd we would help them adapt.\n\n00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:42.006\nAnd we would help them make\nthe transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.792\nI do think a reform of the international\ninstitutions is vital to this.\n\n00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:48.117\nWhen the IMF was created in the 1940s,\n\n00:14:48.141 --> 00:14:51.809\nit was created with resources that were\nfive percent or so of the world's GDP.\n\n00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.143\nThe IMF now has limited\nresources, one percent.\n\n00:14:54.167 --> 00:14:55.866\nIt can't really make the difference\n\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.039\nthat ought to be made\nin a period of crisis.\n\n00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:00.934\nSo,

00:15:07.449\nwith the different voting shares\nin these institutions to do so.\n\n00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:10.657\nThere is a story told\nabout the three world leaders\n\n00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:14.811\nof the day getting a chance\nto get some advice from God.\n\n00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:19.338\nAnd the story is told\nthat Bill Clinton went to God\n\n00:15:19.362 --> 00:15:24.528\nand he asked when there will be\nsuccessful climate change\n\n00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:26.101\nand a low-carbon economy.\n\n00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.712\nAnd God shook his head and said,\n\n00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:31.855\n\"Not this year, not this decade,\nperhaps not even in [your] lifetime.\"\n\n00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:34.934\nAnd Bill Clinton walked away in tears\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.054\nbecause he had failed\nto get what he wanted.\n\n00:15:37.078 --> 00:15:40.703\nAnd then the story is that Barroso,\nthe president of the European Commission,\n\n00:15:40.727 --> 00:15:42.184\nwent to God and he asked,\n\n00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:46.553\n\"When will we get\na recovery of global growth?\"\n\n00:15:46.577 --> 00:15:48.912\nAnd God said, \"Not this year,\nnot in this decade,\n\n00:15:48.936 --> 00:15:50.555\nperhaps not in your lifetime.\"\n\n00:15:50.579 --> 00:15:53.357\nSo Barroso walked away\ncrying and in tears.\n\n00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:58.934\nAnd then the Secretary-General\nof the United Nations\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.422\ncame up to speak to God and said,\n\n00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:04.006\n\"When will our international\ninstitutions work?\"\n\n00:16:04.688 --> 00:16:05.881\nAnd God cried.\n\n00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:09.663\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:09.687 --> 00:16:16.333\nIt is very important to recognize\nthat this reform of

"How do you observe something you can't see? This is the basic question of somebody who's interested in finding and studying black holes. Because black holes are objects whose pull of gravity is so intense that nothing can escape it, not even light, so you can't see it directly.So, my story today about black holes is about one particular black hole. I'm interested in finding whether or not there is a really massive, what we like to call \"supermassive\" black hole at the center of our galaxy. And the reason this is interesting is that it gives us an opportunity to prove whether or not these exotic objects really exist. And second, it gives us the opportunity to understand how these supermassive black holes interact with their environment, and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution of the galaxies which they reside in.So, to begin with, we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole. So, what is a black hole? Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object, because there are only three characteristics that you can describe: the mass, the spin, and the charge. And I'm going to only talk about the mass. So, in that sense, it's a very simple object. But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe, and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe.But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole, for the proof of a black hole, is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume. So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive, and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment, it has no finite size. So, this is a little tricky.But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see, and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius. And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius. This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size. So why is it so important? It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole. That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone, the auditorium can become a black hole if you can figure out how to compress it down to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.At that point, what's going to happen? At that point gravity wins. Gravity wins over all other known forces. And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object. And then it's a black hole. So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube, it would become a black hole, because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is. And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out. It depends only on the mass of the object. Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii. Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii. So, if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford, it would become a black hole.So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is. And it's actually quite a useful concept, because it tells us not only when a black hole will form, but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole. I only need two things. I need to understand the mass of the object I'm claiming is a black hole, and what its Schwarzschild radius is. And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius, there is actually only one thing I really need to know.So, my job in convincing you that there is a black hole is to show that there is some object that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius. And your job today is to be skeptical. Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole; I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is, as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole. An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life. So, if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun, it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here. And inside that supernova remnant is going to be a little black hole that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun. On an astronomical scale that's a very small black hole.Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes. And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies. And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes. There are big ones. There are little ones. Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy. And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left. And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy, just to give you a sense of scale. And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy, which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here, comes from the light from the stars. So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies. I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world, because they are kind of show offs. And we call them active galactic nuclei. And we call them that because their nucleus, or their center, are very active. So, at the center there, that's actually where most of the starlight comes out from. And yet, what we actually see is light that can't be explained by the starlight. It's way more energetic. In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here. There are also jets emanating out from the center. Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.So, what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which matter is falling on to. So, you can't see the black hole itself, but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole into the light we see. So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes exist at the center of galaxies. But it's a kind of indirect argument.Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes, but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers. And if that's the case \u2014 and this is an example of a normal galaxy; what we see is the star light. And if there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet. Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see in active galactic nuclei.If we're going to look for these stealth black holes at the center of galaxies, the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way. And this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the Milky Way. And what we see is a line of stars. And that is because we live in a galaxy which has a flattened, disk-like structure. And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center, we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy, or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy is 100 times further away. So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else. And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail is key to this experiment.So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass inside a small volume? Which is the job that I have to show you today. And the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole. Stars will orbit the black hole in the very same way that planets orbit the sun. It's the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit. If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off, or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit.So, this is great, because remember my job is to show there is a lot of mass inside a small volume. So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass. And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius. So, I want to see the stars that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible. Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible. So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail. And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope.This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court. Now, this is wonderful, because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope, the smaller the detail that we can see. But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise. And that is because of the atmosphere. Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us to survive here on Earth. But it's relatively challenging for astronomers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.So, to give you a sense of what this is like, it's actually like looking at a pebble at the bottom of a stream. Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream, the stream is continuously moving and turbulent, and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream. Very much in the same way, it's very difficult to see astronomical sources, because of the atmosphere that's continuously moving by.So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view. And that buys us about a factor of 20. And I think all of you can agree that if you can figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20, you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot, say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.And this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics. You're seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique \u2014 in other words, just a picture that shows the stars \u2014 and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy, where we think the black hole is. So, without this technology you can't see the stars. With this technology all of a sudden you can see it. This technology works by introducing a mirror into the telescope optics system that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you. So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on that little square there. So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square, although we've looked at all of them. So, I want to see how these things have moved. And over the course of this experiment, these stars have moved a tremendous amount. So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years, and we see the stars go all the way around.Now, most astronomers have a favorite star, and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2. Absolutely my favorite star in the world. And that's because it goes around in only 15 years. And to give you a sense of how short that is, the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy. Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy as possible, take 500 years. And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime. That's kind of profound, in a way.But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me how much mass is inside a very small radius. So, next we see a picture here that shows you before this experiment the size to which we could confine the mass of the center of the galaxy. What we knew before is that there was four million times the mass of the sun inside that circle. And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle. You can see a lot of stars. So, there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, because you could put a lot of stuff in there.But with this experiment, we've confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that's 10,000 times smaller. And because of that, we've been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there. To give you a sense of how small that size is, that's the size of our solar system. So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun into that small volume.Now, truth in advertising. Right? I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius. And the truth is, I'm not quite there. But we actually have no alternative today to explaining this concentration of mass. And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe. So, what next? I actually think this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology, so let's move on with the problem.So, what I want to tell you, very briefly, is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is, or at least we believe, that there is a supermassive black hole there. And the fun phase of this experiment is, while we've tested some of our ideas about the consequences of a supermassive black hole being at the center of our galaxy, almost every single one has been inconsistent with what we actually see. And that's the fun.So, let me give you the two examples. You can ask, \"What do you expect for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.\" What you expect there is that old stars should be very clustered around the black hole. You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars, they just should not be there. A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery. To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse. And it's a very fragile entity. And what does the big black hole do? It strips that gas cloud apart. It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart. In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.So, you shouldn't see young stars. So, what do we see? Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today, we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young. The old ones are red. The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet. So, you can already see the surprise. There is a dearth of old stars. There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.So, this is the fun part. And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out, this mystery of how do you get \u2014 how do you resolve this contradiction. So, in fact, my graduate students are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope, in Hawaii, making observations to get us hopefully to the next stage, where we can address this question of why are there so many young stars, and so few old stars. To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits of stars that are much further away. To do that we'll probably need much more sophisticated technology than we have today.Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only correct for half the errors that are introduced. We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere, and what we think we can do is if we shine a few more that we can correct the rest. So this is what we hope to do in the next few years. And on a much longer time scale, what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes, because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope. And with this telescope we should be able to see stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy. And we hope to be able to test some of Einstein's theories of general relativity, some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form. So, we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting.So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation that basically shows you how these orbits have been moving, in three dimensions. And I hope, if nothing else, I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. And this means that these things do exist in our universe, and we have to contend with this, we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world.Second, we've been able to look at that interaction of how supermassive black holes interact, and understand, maybe, the role in which they play in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.And last but not least, none of this would have happened without the advent of the tremendous progress that's been made on the technology front. And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast, and holds a lot in store for the future. Thanks very much.

the black hole has no size.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo why is it so important?\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nIt's important because it tells us\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat any object can become a black hole.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nThat means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthe auditorium can become a black hole\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nif you can figure out how to compress it down\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nto the size of the Schwarzschild radius.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAt that point, what's going to happen?\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAt that point gravity wins.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nGravity wins over all other known forces.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd the object is forced to continue to collapse\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nto an infinitely small object.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd then it's a black hole.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nSo, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nit would become a black hole,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nbecause the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nNow, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt depends only on the mass of the object.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSmaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo, if I were to take the sun\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nand compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nit would become a black hole.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd it's actually quite a useful concept,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nbecause it tells us not only\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nwhen a black hole will form,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nbut it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nI only need two things.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nI need to understand the mass of the object\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI'm claiming is a black hole,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand what its Schwarzschild radius is.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthere is actually only one thing I really need to know.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo, my job in convincing you\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthat there is a black hole\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nis to show that there is some object\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthat's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd your job today is to be skeptical.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nOkay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nas if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAn ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nof a really massive star's life.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nSo, if a star starts its life off\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nwith much more mass than the mass of the Sun,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nit's going to end its life by exploding\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd inside that supernova remnant\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis going to be a little black hole\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthat has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nOn an astronomical scale\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat's a very small black hole.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nNow, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nshows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThere are big ones. There are little ones.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAlmost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\njust to give you a sense of scale.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nwhich is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\ncomes from the light from the stars.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo, we see the galaxy because of the star light.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nNow, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nbecause they are kind of show offs.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd we call them active galactic nuclei.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd we call them that because their nucleus,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nor their center, are very active.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo, at the center there, that's actually where\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nmost of the starlight comes out from.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd yet, what we actually see is light\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat can't be explained by the starlight.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt's way more energetic.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nIn fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThere are also jets emanating out from the center.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAgain, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nif you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo, what people have thought is that perhaps\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthere are supermassive black holes\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nwhich matter is falling on to.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSo, you can't see the black hole itself,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ninto the light we see.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nSo, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nexist at the center of galaxies.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nBut it's a kind of indirect argument.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nNonetheless, it's given rise to the notion\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthat maybe it's not just these prima donnas\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat have these supermassive black holes,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nbut rather all galaxies might harbor these\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nsupermassive black holes at their centers.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nwhat we see is the star light.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd if there is a supermassive black hole,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhat we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBecause that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nin active galactic nuclei.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIf we're going to look for these stealth black holes\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nat the center of galaxies,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd this is a wide field picture\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\ntaken of the center of the Milky Way.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nAnd what we see is a line of stars.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd that is because we live in a galaxy which has\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\na flattened, disk-like structure.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwe see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nor line that defines the plane of the galaxy.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nNow, the advantage of studying our own galaxy\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nis it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nis 100 times further away.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, we can see far more detail in our galaxy\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthan anyplace else.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nAnd as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nis key to this experiment.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\ninside a small volume?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWhich is the job that I have to show you today.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd the tool that we use is to watch the way\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nstars orbit the black hole.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nStars will orbit the black hole\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nin the very same way that planets orbit the sun.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIt's the gravitational pull\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthat makes these things orbit.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nIf there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nor at least go at a much slower rate\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nbecause all that determines how they go around\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nis how much mass is inside its orbit.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo, this is great, because remember my job is to show\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthere is a lot of mass inside a small volume.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nSo, I want to see the stars\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nBecause I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nSo, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd that's the reason that for this experiment we've used\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nthe world's largest telescope.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nThis is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwith a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthe diameter of a tennis court.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nNow, this is wonderful,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nbecause the campaign promise\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nof large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nthe smaller the detail that we can see.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nBut it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nhas had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd that is because of the atmosphere.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAtmosphere is great for us; it allows us\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nto survive here on Earth.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBut it's relatively challenging for astronomers\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nwho want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo, to give you a sense of what this is like,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nit's actually like looking at a pebble\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nat the bottom of a stream.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nLooking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nthe stream is continuously moving and turbulent,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nVery much in the same way, it's very difficult\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nto see astronomical sources, because of the\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\natmosphere that's continuously moving by.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nSo, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nto correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd that buys us about a factor of 20.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd I think all of you can agree that if you can\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nfigure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nyou've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nsay your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd this animation here shows you one example of\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthe techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nYou're seeing an animation that goes between\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nan example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nin other words, just a picture that shows the stars --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nand the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwhere we think the black hole is.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo, without this technology you can't see the stars.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nWith this technology all of a sudden you can see it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThis technology works by introducing a mirror\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ninto the telescope optics system\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthat's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSo, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nNow, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nthat little square there.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nalthough we've looked at all of them.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo, I want to see how these things have moved.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd over the course of this experiment, these stars\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nhave moved a tremendous amount.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nSo, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand we see the stars go all the way around.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nNow, most astronomers have a favorite star,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAbsolutely my favorite star in the world.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd that's because it goes around in only 15 years.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd to give you a sense of how short that is,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nStars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nas possible, take 500 years.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThat's kind of profound, in a way.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nBut it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nhow much mass is inside a very small radius.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo, next we see a picture here that shows you\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nbefore this experiment the size to which we could\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nconfine the mass of the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat we knew before is that there was four million\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ntimes the mass of the sun inside that circle.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nYou can see a lot of stars.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nSo, there was actually lots of alternatives\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nto the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nbecause you could put a lot of stuff in there.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nBut with this experiment, we've confined\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat same mass to a much smaller volume\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat's 10,000 times smaller.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd because of that, we've been able to show\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthat there is a supermassive black hole there.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nTo give you a sense of how small that size is,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nthat's the size of our solar system.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\ninto that small volume.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nNow, truth in advertising. Right?\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nI have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd the truth is, I'm not quite there.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nBut we actually have no alternative today\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto explaining this concentration of mass.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nfor not only existence of a supermassive black hole\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nat the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nSo, what next? I actually think\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthis is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nso let's move on with the problem.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nSo, what I want to tell you, very briefly,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nis a few examples\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nof the excitement of what we can do today\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nat the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nor at least we believe,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nthat there is a supermassive black hole there.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd the fun phase of this experiment\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nis, while we've tested some of our ideas\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nabout the consequences of a supermassive black hole\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nbeing at the center of our galaxy,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nalmost every single one\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhas been inconsistent with what we actually see.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd that's the fun.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nSo, let me give you the two examples.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nYou can ask, \"What do you expect\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nfor the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfor a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.\"\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nWhat you expect there is that old stars\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nshould be very clustered around the black hole.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nYou should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nLikewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthey just should not be there.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nA black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nTo get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it's a very fragile entity.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd what does the big black hole do?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nIt strips that gas cloud apart.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nIt pulls much stronger on one side than the other\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nand the cloud is stripped apart.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nIn fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nSo, you shouldn't see young stars.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nSo, what do we see?\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nUsing observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwe can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nThe old ones are red.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThe young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nSo, you can already see the surprise.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThere is a dearth of old stars.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThere is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nSo, this is the fun part.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nthis mystery of how do you get --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nhow do you resolve this contradiction.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nSo, in fact, my graduate students\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nare, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nin Hawaii, making observations to get us\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nhopefully to the next stage,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nwhere we can address this question\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nof why are there so many young stars,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand so few old stars.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nTo make further progress we really need to look at the orbits\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nof stars that are much further away.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nTo do that we'll probably need much more\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nsophisticated technology than we have today.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nBecause, in truth, while I said we're correcting\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nfor the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\ncorrect for half the errors that are introduced.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nWe do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand what we think we can do is if we\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nshine a few more that we can correct the rest.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nSo this is what we hope to do in the next few years.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd on a much longer time scale,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nwhat we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nbecause, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nSo, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nAnd with this telescope we should be able to see\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nstars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd we hope to be able to test some of\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nEinstein's theories of general relativity,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nsome ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo, we think the future of this experiment\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nis quite exciting.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSo, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nthat basically shows you how these\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\norbits have been moving, in three dimensions.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I hope, if nothing else,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nI've convinced you that, one, we do in fact\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nhave a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd this means that these things do exist in our universe,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nand we have to contend with this, we have to explain\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nhow you can get these objects in our physical world.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSecond, we've been able to look at that interaction\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nof how supermassive black holes interact,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nand understand, maybe, the role in which they play\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nin shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd last but not least,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nnone of this would have happened\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nwithout the advent of the tremendous progress\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthat's been made on the technology front.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nand holds a lot in store for the future.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The ancient ingenuity of water harvesting", "duration": "1034", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anupam_mishra_the_ancient_ingenuity_of_water_harvesting", "transcript": "For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert. So, first, a small housekeeping announcement: please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. (Applause)So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert. It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall. If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters]. The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters. And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking. So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages. But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps \u2014 they are of no use in this area.So, welcome to the Golden Desert. Clouds seldom visit this area. But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here. There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. This is a new work, it's a new program. But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life. And they harvest rain in many ways. So, this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field. And this is all big raised platform. You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope. Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly. And the water will go where it should go. And then it is 40 feet deep. The waterproofing is done perfectly, better than our city contractors, because not a single drop should go waste in this.They collect 100 thousand liters in one season. And this is pure drinking water. Below the surface there is hard saline water. But now you can have this for year round. It's two houses. We often use a term called bylaws. Because we are used to get written things. But here it is unwritten by law. And people made their house, and the water storage tanks. These raised up platforms just like this stage. In fact they go 15 feet deep, and collect rain water from roof, there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard. It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.Another big one, this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. The age is 400 years. So, since 400 years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. You can calculate the price of that water. It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old. It can break sometimes. But this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations. Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked. But they can be opened for TED people. (Laughter) And we request them. You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. And the water level \u2014 these are not empty canisters \u2014 water level is right up to this. It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water. And this is what they call Zero B type of water, because it comes from the clouds, pure distilled water.We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems. The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. That's why I said that this is a commercial break. (Laughter) But we will come back, once again, to the traditional thing. So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this. In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this: where the water hyacinth couldn't grow, the sand is flowing in these canals. The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. (Laughter)We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came. They said that throw away your traditional systems, these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. It's a dream. And it became a dream also. Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. And people started renovating their own structures.These are all traditional water structures, which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. But you can see that no woman is standing on those. (Laughter) And they are plaiting hair. (Applause) Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. This town was established 800 years ago. I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there, or Delhi was there, or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.So, this was the terminal point for silk route. Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe. None of us were able to go to Europe, but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. And this is the 16 centimeter area. Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. You won't find water in this slide. But it is invisible. Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms.But apart from this system, they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town. And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout.Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart. These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table. When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today \"mass communication.\" This was for mass communication. Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned, so water will be there for seven months or nine months, or 12 months. And then they will come and worship this pond, pay respect, their gratitude.Another small water body, called the [unclear]. It is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English. But the nearest would be \"glory,\" a reputation. The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. And perhaps they knew the future also. It was designed some 150 years ago. But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this. (Laughter) (Applause)Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water. But this is not ground water. You can draw ground water from any well. But this is no ordinary well. It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear]. And there is a gypsum belt running below it. And it was deposited by the great mother Earth, some three million years ago. And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water.This is the same dry water body. Now, you don't find any kund; they are all submerged. But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. This year they have received only six centimeters. Six centimeter of rainfall, and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city, Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water. (Laughter)How they maintain them? There are three things: concept, planning, making the actual thing, and also maintaining them. It is a structure for maintain, for centuries, by generations, without any department, without any funding, So the secret is \"[unclear],\" respect. Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time.So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected. Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side. If you climb these three, six steps you will find something very nice. This was done in 11th century. And you have to go further down. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words. If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs. If it comes up, some of them will be submerged. So, throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. (Applause)Excuse me, who built these structures? They are in front of you. The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects. We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847. There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools. But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ... (Laughter) but not to create the engineering colleges. But because of them, first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town.The last point, we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart. This tire comes from the airplane. So, look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater, and also create something through a tire from a jet plane, and used in a camel cart.Last picture, it's a tattoo, 2,000-years-old tattoo. They were using it on their body. Tattoo was, at one time, a kind of a blacklisted or con thing, but now it is in thing. (Laughter) (Applause) You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. (Laughter) The center of life is water. These are the beautiful waves. These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. These are the trees. And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. So, this is the message of desert. Thank you very much. (Applause)Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language. (Applause) These artifacts and designs are inspiring. Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this? Or is this just right for this place?Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere, right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also. And these [unclear], which stored water, there are two type of things. One recharge, and one stores. So, it depends on the terrain. But kund, which uses the gypsum belt, for that you have to go back to your calendar, three million years ago. If it is there it can be done right now. Otherwise, it can't be done. (Laughter) (Applause)CA: Thank you so much.

This is called the Jaigarh Fort.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThe age is 400 years.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo, since 400 years it has been giving you\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nalmost six million gallons of water per season.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nYou can calculate the price of that water.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nYou can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nIt can break sometimes.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nBut this 400 year old canal, which draws water,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit is maintained for so many generations.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nOf course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBut they can be opened for TED people.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd we request them.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nYou can see person coming up with\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\ntwo canisters of water.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd the water level -- these are not empty canisters --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nwater level is right up to this.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt can envy many municipalities,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthe color, the taste, the purity of this water.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd this is what they call Zero B type of water,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nbecause it comes from the clouds,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\npure distilled water.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nWe stop for a quick commercial break,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand then we come back to the traditional systems.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThe government thought that this is a very\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbackward area and we should bring\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\na multi-million dollar project\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nto bring water from the Himalayas.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThat's why I said that this is a commercial break.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut we will come back, once again,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto the traditional thing.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nsoon it become like this.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nIn many portions, water hyacinth\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:47.958\ncovered these big canals like anything.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nOf course there are some areas where water is reaching,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nI'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nBut the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nyou will notice in Bikaner things like this:\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwhere the water hyacinth couldn't grow,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe sand is flowing in these canals.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThe bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWe had full-page advertisements,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nsome 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThey said that throw away your traditional systems,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthese new cement tanks will supply you piped water.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIt's a dream. And it became a dream also.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nBecause soon the water was not able to reach these areas.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd people started renovating their own structures.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThese are all traditional water structures,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwhich we won't be able to explain in such a short time.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nBut you can see that no woman is standing on those.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd they are plaiting hair.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nJaisalmer. This is heart of desert.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThis town was established 800 years ago.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI'm not sure by that time\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nBombay was there, or Delhi was there,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nor Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo, this was the terminal point for silk route.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nWell connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nNone of us were able to go to Europe,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nbut Jaisalmer was well connected to it.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd this is the 16 centimeter area.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nSuch a limited rainfall,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nand highest colorful life flourished in these areas.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nYou won't find water in this slide.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBut it is invisible.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSomewhere a stream or a rivulet\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nis running through here.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nOr, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nbecause every roof which you see in this picture\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\ncollects rainwater drops\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nand deposit in the rooms.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nBut apart from this system,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nthey designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd what we call private public partnership\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nyou can add estate also.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo, estate, public and private entrepreneurs\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwork together to build this beautiful water body.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd it's a kind of water body for all seasons.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nYou will admire it.

those structures throughout the year.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThis year they have received only six centimeters.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSix centimeter of rainfall,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand they can telephone you\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat if you find any water problem in your city,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nDelhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nplease come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nHow they maintain them?\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nThere are three things: concept, planning,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nmaking the actual thing, and also maintaining them.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt is a structure for maintain,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nfor centuries, by generations, without any department,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nwithout any funding,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo the secret is \"[unclear],\" respect.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nYour own thing, not personal property,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nmy property, every time.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, these stone pillars\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwill remind you that you are entering into a water body area.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nDon't spit, don't do anything wrong,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nso that the clean water can be collected.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnother pillar, stone pillar on your right side.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIf you climb these three, six steps\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nyou will find something very nice.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThis was done in 11th century.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd you have to go further down.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThey say that a picture is worth a thousand words,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nso we can say a thousand words right now,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nan another thousand words.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nIf the water table goes down,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nyou will find new stairs.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nIf it comes up, some of them will be submerged.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo, throughout the year\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nthis beautiful system will give you some pleasure.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThree sides, such steps, on the fourth side\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthere is a four-story building\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwhere you can organize such TED conferences anytime.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nExcuse me, who built these structures?\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThey are in front of you.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nThe best civil engineers we had, the best planners,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nthe best architects.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nWe can say that because of them,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nbecause of their forefathers,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIndia could get the first engineering college\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin 1847.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThere were no English medium schools at that time,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\neven no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nBut such people, compelled to the East India Company,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhich came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nbut not to create the engineering colleges.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nBut because of them, first engineering college was created\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nin a small village, not in the town.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThe last point, we all know in our primary schools that\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat camel is a ship of desert.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nSo, you can find through your Jeep,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\na camel, and a cart.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThis tire comes from the airplane.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo, look at the beauty from the desert society\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwho can harvest rainwater,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand also create something\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nthrough a tire from a jet plane,\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand used in a camel cart.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nLast picture, it's a tattoo,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\n2,000-years-old tattoo.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThey were using it on their body.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nTattoo was, at one time,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\na kind of a blacklisted\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nor con thing, but now it is in thing.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nYou can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nThe center of life is water.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nThese are the beautiful waves.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nThese are the beautiful stairs\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nwhich we just saw in one of the slides.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nThese are the trees.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd these are the flowers which\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nadd fragrance to our lives.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo, this is the message of desert.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:56.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nChris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:07.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nThese artifacts and designs are inspiring.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nDo you believe that they can be used elsewhere,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nthat the world can learn from this?\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nOr is this just right for this place?\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nutilize water that falls on our area.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nSo, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nright from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nAnd these [unclear], which stored water,\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nthere are two type of things.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nOne recharge, and one stores.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, it depends on the terrain.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nBut kund, which uses the gypsum belt,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nfor that you have to go back to your calendar,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nthree million years ago.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nIf it is there it can be done right now.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nOtherwise, it can't be done.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:16:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nCA: Thank you so much.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The art of puzzles", "duration": "709", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/scott_kim_takes_apart_the_art_of_puzzles", "transcript": "For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles. And I'm here today to give you a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed, through what I'm doing now. I've designed puzzles for books, printed things. I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine. I've been doing that for about 10 years. I have a monthly puzzle calendar. I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games. I did puzzles for \"Bejeweled.\" (Applause) I didn't invent \"Bejeweled.\" I can't take credit for that.So, very first puzzle, sixth grade, my teacher said, \"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff. I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the board.\" I thought this was a great assignment. And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it. I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once. The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it? One hint: It's not \"L.\" (Laughter) It could be an \"L,\" of course. So, what else could it be? Yeah, a lot of you got it. Oh yeah. So, clever thing.Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked. I created something new, I was very excited because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles, but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix. This was something really original. I got hooked. I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American. Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle? A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer. \"Fun to solve,\" as opposed to everyday problems, which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles. You know, they might have a solution. It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly. Who designed this? It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story so we have to hire writers to make movies.Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them. And \"right answer,\" of course there might be more than one right answer; many puzzles have more than one. But as opposed to a couple other forms of play, toys and games \u2014 by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal. You can create one out of Legos. You know, you can do anything you want. Or competitive games like chess where, well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle, but the goal really is to beat another player.I consider that puzzles are an art form. They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history. It's a very small form, like a joke, a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form. At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement. But at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression. The progression of my career that you'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games, is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception. I'll show you how. Here is a famous one. So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle. This is called a figure-ground illusion. The artist M.C. Escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints. Here we have \"Day and Night.\" Here is what I did with figure and ground. So, here we have \"figure\" in black. Here we have \"figure\" in white. And it's all part of the same design. The background to one is the other. Originally I tried to do the words \"figure\" and \"ground.\" But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem. It's all \"figure.\" (Laughter)A few other things. Here is my name. And that turns into the title of my first book, \"Inversions.\" These sorts of designs now go by the word \"ambigram.\" I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually. Each letter here is one of these digits. Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense. I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.Here's the word \"mirror.\" No, it's not the same upside-down. It's the same this way. And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda. And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon. (Laughter) And recently in Magic magazine I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names. So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down. This appears in my puzzle calendar. Okay, let's go back to the slides. Thank you very much.Now, those are fun to look at. Now how would you do it interactively? For a while I was an interface designer. And so I think a lot about interaction. Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion, make the thing on the right. Now, if you could pick up the black vase, it would look like the figure on top. If you could pick up the white area, it would look like the figure on the bottom. Well, you can't do that physically, but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.And here it is, figure-ground. The goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape on the right. And this follows the rules I just said: any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up. But that is also true of any white area. So, here we got the white area in the middle, and you can pick it up. I'll just go one step further. So, here is \u2014 here is a couple pieces. Move them together, and now this is an active piece. You can really get inside somebody's perception and have them experience something. It's like the old maxim of \"you can tell somebody something and show them, but if they do it they really learn it.\"Here is another thing you can do. There is a game called Rush Hour. This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube. So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place. The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle. It's made by the company Think Fun. It's done very well. I love this puzzle.Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle. Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece. Okay, so how would you solve this one? Well, move the blue one out of the way. Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy. Now we'll make it harder, a little harder. Now, this one is a little bit trickier. You know? What do you do here? The first move is going to be what? You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right. And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all. Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.I wanted to make a sequel. I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way I work as an inventor is to create a sequel. I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour. It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece, a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically. In the other game the cars can only move forward and back. Created a whole bunch of levels for it. Now I'm making it available to schools. And it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles, but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them. Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist. You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon. In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker. I got interested in gene sequencing. And I said, \"Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in DNA?\" Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces, and then you look for overlaps, and you basically match them at the edges. And I said, \"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap.\"So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine. And it has to be solvable in a magazine. You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around. So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid. And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge. There is only one solution. It's not that hard. But it takes some persistence. And when you're done, it makes this design, which, if you squint, is the word \"helix.\" So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content, rather than the other way around.Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle. Which way will these fall? One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds. And depending on which one weighs which amount, they'll fall different directions. And here is a puzzle based on color mixing. I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black, the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations, and you get these peculiar pictures. Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures? Gets you thinking about color.Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com, website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim. She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work. So, we're making smart games for social media. I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends. This is what's going on in the games industry right now. First of all, you know, for a long time computer games meant things like \"Doom,\" where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast, aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.Well, guess what? That's changing. \"Bejeweled\" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open what's called casual games. And the main players are over 35, and are female. Then recently \"Rock Band\" has been a big hit. And it's a game you play with other people. It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game. This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.Now, within that there is some interesting things happening. There is also a trend towards games that are good for you. Why? Well, we aging Boomers, Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food, we're exercising. What about our minds? Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something. Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's. So, we got games like \"Brain Age\" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit. A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet. Everybody now considers themselves a creator, and not just a viewer. And what does this add up to? Here is what we see coming. It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle. They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing. And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun. I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media. And we decided to combine our skills.Our first game is called \"Photo Grab.\" The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds. This is your first time playing my game. Okay. Let's see how well we can do. There are three images. And we have 24 seconds each. Where is that? I'll play as fast as I can. But if you can see it, shout out the answer. You get more \u2014 Down, okay, yeah where is that? Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and \u2014 I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps. That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems. Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one. Okay, so that's the lens. Anybody? Looks like a black shape. So, where is that? That's the corner of the whole thing. Yeah, I've played this image before, but even when I make up my own puzzles \u2014 and you can put your own images in here.

The bulk of my work is in computer games.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nI did puzzles for \"Bejeweled.\"\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:39.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nI didn't invent \"Bejeweled.\" I can't take credit for that.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo, very first puzzle,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nsixth grade, my teacher said,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\n\"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nI'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nfor the board.\"\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nI thought this was a great assignment.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nI came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nthat's been folded just once.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nThe question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nOne hint: It's not \"L.\"\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIt could be an \"L,\" of course.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSo, what else could it be?\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nYeah, a lot of you got it.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nOh yeah. So, clever thing.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nNow, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nI created something new, I was very excited\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbecause, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbut that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nThis was something really original. I got hooked.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nI read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nWent on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nNow, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nA puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nand has a right answer.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n\"Fun to solve,\" as opposed to everyday problems,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwhich, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nYou know, they might have a solution.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nIt might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nWho designed this?\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nIt's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nso we have to hire writers to make movies.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nWell, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd \"right answer,\" of course there might be more than one right answer;\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nmany puzzles have more than one.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nBut as opposed to a couple other forms of play,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\ntoys and games --\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nby toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nYou can create one out of Legos.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nYou know, you can do anything you want.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nOr competitive games like chess where,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nwell, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbut the goal really is to beat another player.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nI consider that puzzles are an art form.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nThey're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIt's a very small form, like a joke,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\na poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAt worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nBut at best they can reach for something more\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand create a memorable impression.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThe progression of my career that you'll see\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nis looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nSo, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nis that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nI'll show you how. Here is a famous one.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSo, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThis is called a figure-ground illusion.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThe artist M.C. Escher exploited that\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nin some of his wonderful prints.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nHere we have \"Day and Night.\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nHere is what I did with figure and ground.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nSo, here we have \"figure\" in black.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nHere we have \"figure\" in white.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd it's all part of the same design.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThe background to one is the other.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nOriginally I tried to do the words \"figure\" and \"ground.\"\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nBut I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nIt's all \"figure.\"\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nA few other things. Here is my name.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd that turns into the title of my first book, \"Inversions.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nThese sorts of designs now go by the word \"ambigram.\"\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nI'll show you just a couple others. Here we have\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthe numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nEach letter here is one of these digits.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nNot strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nI like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nHere's the word \"mirror.\" No, it's not the same upside-down.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIt's the same this way.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwho just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd recently in Magic magazine\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nSo here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThis appears in my puzzle calendar.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nOkay, let's go back to the slides.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nNow, those are fun to look at.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nNow how would you do it interactively?\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nFor a while I was an interface designer.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd so I think a lot about interaction.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nWell, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nmake the thing on the right.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nNow, if you could pick up the black vase,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nit would look like the figure on top.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIf you could pick up the white area,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nit would look like the figure on the bottom.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nWell, you can't do that physically,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd here it is, figure-ground.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThe goal here is to take the pieces on the left\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand make them so they look like the shape on the right.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nAnd this follows the rules I just said:\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nany black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nBut that is also true of any white area.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo, here we got the white area in the middle,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand you can pick it up.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nI'll just go one step further.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nSo, here is --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nhere is a couple pieces. Move them together,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand now this is an active piece.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nYou can really get inside somebody's perception\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nand have them experience something.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nIt's like the old maxim of\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"you can tell somebody something\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand show them, but if they do it they really learn it.\"\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nHere is another thing you can do.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nThere is a game called Rush Hour.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThis is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nbesides Rubik's cube.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nSo, here we have a crowded parking lot\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nwith cars all over the place.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThe goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nIt's made by the company Think Fun.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nIt's done very well. I love this puzzle.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWell, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWell, that's too simple, let's add another piece.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nOkay, so how would you solve this one?\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nWell, move the blue one out of the way.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nHere, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow we'll make it harder, a little harder.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nNow, this one is a little bit trickier.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nYou know? What do you do here?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThe first move is going to be what?\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nYou're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThose four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI wanted to make a sequel.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nI didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nI work as an inventor is to create a sequel.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nI came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\na square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIn the other game the cars can only move forward and back.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nCreated a whole bunch of levels for it.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nNow I'm making it available to schools.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd it includes exercises that show you\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nnot just how to solve these puzzles,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut how to extract the principles that will let you solve\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nmathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nas well as just me creating them.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nGarry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nYou know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nIn Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nI got interested in gene sequencing.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nof the base pairs in DNA?\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nCut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand then you look for overlaps,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nand you basically match them at the edges. And I said,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\n\"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap.\"\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd it has to be solvable in a magazine.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nYou know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nAnd you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThere is only one solution. It's not that hard.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nBut it takes some persistence.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nAnd when you're done, it makes this design,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwhich, if you squint, is the word \"helix.\"\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nrather than the other way around.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nHere is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nWhich way will these fall?\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nOne of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd depending on which one weighs which amount,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthey'll fall different directions.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd here is a puzzle based on color mixing.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nI separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthe basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand you get these peculiar pictures.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nWhich separations were mixed up to make those pictures?\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nGets you thinking about color.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nFinally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwebsite you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nShe could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo, we're making smart games for social media.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nI'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThis is what's going on in the games industry right now.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nFirst of all, you know, for a long time\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ncomputer games meant things like \"Doom,\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nwhere you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\naimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nWell, guess what? That's changing.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\n\"Bejeweled\" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwhat's called casual games.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd the main players are over 35, and are female.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThen recently \"Rock Band\" has been a big hit.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd it's a game you play with other people.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nIt's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nThis is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nNow, within that there is some interesting things happening.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nThere is also a trend towards games that are good for you.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWhy? Well, we aging Boomers,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nBaby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwe're exercising. What about our minds?\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nOh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nTurns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nSo, we got games like \"Brain Age\" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nA lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nAnd then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nEverybody now considers themselves a creator,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand not just a viewer.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd what does this add up to?\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nHere is what we see coming.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nIt's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThey're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nI'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd we decided to combine our skills.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nOur first game is called \"Photo Grab.\" The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nThis is your first time playing my game. Okay.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nLet's see how well we can do. There are three images.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we have 24 seconds each.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nWhere is that?\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI'll play as fast as I can.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nBut if you can see it, shout out the answer.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nYou get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nOh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nI guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nThat's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nYeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nOkay, so that's the lens.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnybody?\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nLooks like a black shape. So, where is that?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nThat's the corner of the whole thing.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nYeah, I've played this image before,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nbut even when I make up my own puzzles --\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand you can put your own images in here.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd we have people all over the world doing that now.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThere we are.

I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali. Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution, a prostituted person. She got infected with HIV, and towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute, so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker. By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranitha was already raped by three men.Shaheen's background I don't even know. We found her in a railway track, raped by many, many men, I don't know many. But the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body. And when we took her to the hospital she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body. We still don't know who her parents are, who she is. All that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally.Anjali's father, a drunkard, sold his child for pornography. You're seeing here images of three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. In this country, and across the globe, hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery. But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for. They are sold in the name of adoption. They are sold in the name of organ trade. They are sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything, everything.I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation. And I tell you stories from there. My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager. I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men. I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it. Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my consciousness. I never felt like a victim, then or now. But what lingered from then till now \u2014 I am 40 today \u2014 is this huge outrageous anger.Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated, because I was a victim. And that's what we do to all traffic survivors. We, as a society, we have PhDs in victimizing a victim. Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices, but have absolutely no respite, because we don't allow them to come in.Where does their journey begin? Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor. You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked. I had this I.S. officer's daughter, who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard, who was raped chatting with one individual, and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine, who was trafficked. I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families, and children from well-to-do families, who are getting trafficked.These people are deceived, forced. 99.9 percent of them resist being inducted into prostitution. Some pay the price for it. They're killed; we don't even hear about them. They are voiceless, [unclear], nameless people. But the rest, who succumb into it, go through everyday torture. Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends, or who want to have a family with you. These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day, and use you, throw you.Each of the girls that I have rescued \u2014 I have rescued more than 3,200 girls \u2014 each of them tell me one story in common ... (Applause) one story about one man, at least, putting chili powder in her vagina, one man taking a cigarette and burning her, one man whipping her. We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us. And we are silent about them.We think it is easy money. We think it is shortcut. We think the person likes to do what she's doing. But the extra bonuses that she gets is various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun. And one day she gives up on you and me, because we have no options for her. And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation. She believes, \"Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about.\" And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day. And it's abnormal to live in a shelter. It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.It's in that context that I work. It's in that context that I rescue children. I've rescued children as young as three years, and I've rescued women as old as 40 years. When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was where do I begin. Because I had lots of them who were already HIV infected. One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive. And therefore my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain. And for me, I was my greatest experience. Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation, was my greatest teacher. Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential.You see a girl here who is trained as a welder. She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures. She earns around 12,000 rupees. She is an illiterate girl, trained, skilled as a welder. Why welding and why not computers? We felt, one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage. They did not have any pardas inside their body, hijabs inside themselves; they've crossed the barrier of it. And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world, very easily, and not feel very shy about it.We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers. And each one of them are excelling in their chosen field, gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives. These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.What has been my challenge? My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up. I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life. I can't hear from my right ear. I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue. My biggest challenge is society. It's you and me. My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own.A very supportive friend of mine, a well-wisher of mine, used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables. When her mother fell sick she said, \"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts. Can you get somebody in my house to work, so that she can look after my mother?\" And there is a long pause. And then she says, \"Not one of our girls.\"It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking, in this fantastic A-C hall. It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything. But it is not nice to bring them to our homes. It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies. It's not nice for our children to study with their children. There it ends. That's my biggest challenge.If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan. I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking. They need your compassion. They need your empathy. They need, much more than anything else, your acceptance.Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing: don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem. Can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem? And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support. Can you break your culture of silence? Can you speak to at least two persons about this story? Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars, or something like that. I'm asking you, in your limited world, can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts? Can you just encompass these people too? Because they are also a part of us. They are also part of this world. I'm asking you, for these children, whose faces you see, they're no more. They died of AIDS last year. I'm asking you to help them, accept as human beings \u2014 not as philanthropy, not as charity, but as human beings who deserve all our support. I'm asking you this because no child, no human being, deserves what these children have gone through. Thank you.

around me,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwho are left in sexual slavery-like practices,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nbut have absolutely no respite,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nbecause we don't allow them to come in.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nWhere does their journey begin?\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nMost of them come from very optionless families,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nnot just poor.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nYou have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nI had this I.S. officer's daughter,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nwho is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwho was raped chatting with one individual,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwho was trafficked.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nI have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand children from well-to-do families,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwho are getting trafficked.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThese people are deceived, forced.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\n99.9 percent of them\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nresist being inducted into prostitution.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nSome pay the price for it.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThey're killed; we don't even hear about them.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThey are voiceless, [unclear],\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nnameless people.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nBut the rest, who succumb into it,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\ngo through everyday torture.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nBecause the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nor who want to have a family with you.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThese are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand use you, throw you.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nEach of the girls that I have rescued --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nI have rescued more than 3,200 girls --\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\neach of them tell me one story in common ...\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\none story about one man, at least,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nputting chili powder in her vagina,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\none man taking a cigarette and burning her,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\none man whipping her.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWe are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nuncles, cousins, all around us.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd we are silent about them.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWe think it is easy money.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nWe think it is shortcut.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWe think the person likes to do what she's doing.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nBut the extra bonuses that she gets\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nis various infections, sexually transmitted infections,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nHIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nsubstance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd one day she gives up on you and me,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nbecause we have no options for her.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nShe believes, \"Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about.\"\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd it's abnormal to live in a shelter.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nIt's abnormal to get rehabilitated.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nIt's in that context that I work.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nIt's in that context that I rescue children.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI've rescued children as young as three years,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand I've rescued women as old as 40 years.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nWhen I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwas where do I begin.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nBecause I had lots of them\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwho were already HIV infected.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOne third of the people I rescue\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nare HIV positive.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd therefore my challenge was to\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nunderstand how can I get out\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthe power from this pain.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd for me, I was my greatest experience.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nUnderstanding my own self,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nunderstanding my own pain,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nmy own isolation,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nwas my greatest teacher.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nBecause what we did with these girls\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis to understand their potential.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nYou see a girl here who is trained as a welder.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nShe works for a very big company,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\na workshop in Hyderabad,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nmaking furnitures.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nShe earns around 12,000 rupees.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nShe is an illiterate girl,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\ntrained, skilled as a welder.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWhy welding and why not computers?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWe felt, one of the things that these girls had\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nis immense amount of courage.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nThey did not have any pardas inside their body,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nhijabs inside themselves;\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nthey've crossed the barrier of it.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nvery easily, and not feel very shy about it.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWe have trained girls as carpenters,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nas masons,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nas security guards, as cab drivers.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd each one of them are excelling\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nin their chosen field,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ngaining confidence, restoring dignity,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand building hopes in their own lives.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThese girls are also working in big construction companies\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nlike Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWhat has been my challenge?\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nMy challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nI've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nI can't hear from my right ear.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nI've lost a staff of mine who was murdered\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwhile on a rescue.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nMy biggest challenge\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nis society.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nIt's you and me.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nMy biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nas our own.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nA very supportive friend of mine,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\na well-wisher of mine,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nused to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nWhen her mother fell sick she said,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\n\"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nCan you get somebody in my house to work,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nso that she can look after my mother?\"\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd there is a long pause.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nAnd then she says, \"Not one of our girls.\"\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nin this fantastic A-C hall.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nIt's very nice for discussion, discourse,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nmaking films and everything.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nBut it is not nice to bring them to our homes.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIt's not nice for our children to study with their children.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nThere it ends.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThat's my biggest challenge.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIf I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nI'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nThey need your compassion.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThey need your empathy.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThey need, much more than anything else,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nyour acceptance.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nMany times when I talk to people,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nI keep telling them one thing:\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\ndon't tell me hundred ways\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nhow you cannot respond to this problem.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nCan you ply your mind for that one way\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat you can respond to the problem?\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd that's what I'm here for,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nasking for your support,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\ndemanding for your support,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nrequesting for your support.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nCan you break your culture of silence?\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nCan you speak to at least two persons about this story?\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nTell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nI'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nor Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nor something like that.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nI'm asking you, in your limited world,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ncan you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nCan you just encompass these people too?\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nBecause they are also a part of us.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThey are also part of this world.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI'm asking you, for these children,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nwhose faces you see, they're no more.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThey died of AIDS last year.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nI'm asking you to help them,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\naccept as human beings --\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nnot as philanthropy, not as charity,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nbut as human beings who deserve all our support.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nI'm asking you this because no child, no human being,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\ndeserves what these children have gone through.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nThank you.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A one-man world summit", "duration": "881", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_bremner_s_one_man_world_summit", "transcript": "Chris has been so nice. I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't. So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to, \"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car. And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house. Your house has caught fire. And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend.\"And you know that Chris would say, \"Thank you.\" (Laughter) \"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting.\" (Laughter) \"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you.\" (Laughter)One of the \u2014 (Applause) Thank you for inviting us. One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that, gradually, as the days go by, all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say. (Laughter) Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that. Spectroscopy, that was another one. Parallel universes. And so this morning I thought, \"Oh well, I'll just do a card trick.\" (Laughter) That one's gone as well. And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we? Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause) I was planning on finishing on a dance ... (Laughter) So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.So, what I thought I'd do is \u2014 in honor of Emmanuel \u2014 is, what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction. If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine. (Laughter) Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?Thank you. Bruno's face, just then, he said, \"No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't. Don't go through this. Don't do it.\" (Laughter)I'm worried. When I first got the invitation, they said somewhere in the thing, they said, \"15 minutes to change the world, your moment onstage.\" 15 minutes to change the world. I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug. (Laughter) So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one. Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug, now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric \u2014 fantastic. You know, it inspires us. 300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that. (Laughter) And now it's an idea. (Laughter) It's great. It's fantastic. But you do meet some fantastic people, people who look at the world in a totally different way.Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one who covered most of what I was going to say. (Laughter) But when you think of the world in that way, it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think? I mean, he must walk in and they will say, \"Would you like a macchiato, or a latte, or an Americano, or a cappuccino?\" And he'll say, \"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.\" (Laughter) \"How can your coffee be true?\" (Laughter) And they will say, \"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?\" (Laughter)And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful? Fantastic. Really good. Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this \u2014 we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well. And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said. And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link. And I think, \"I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.\" (Laughter) This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want? (Laughter) And there he is. (Applause) That's how TED brings these connections together.I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's job application \u2014 um, sorry. (Laughter) I'm so sorry. (Applause) I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause) No, no, ahh ... (Applause) (As Brown): \"Global problems require Scottish solutions.\" (Laughter) The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who's just taken the head off a bear suit.(As Brown): \"Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there? Uh, no.\" (Laughter) \"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world, saving the planet, global institutions. Our work on climate change, I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain, like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ...\" (Laughter) \"The large coal-fired power station we're building at King's North, and of course the exciting news that only today, only this week, Britain's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close. No time, unfortunately, to mention those.\" (Applause) \"British jobs for Scottish people ... No.\" (Laughter) \"Christian principles, Christian values. Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.\" (Laughter) \"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem.\" (Laughter)(As Tony Blair): \"Yeah, alright, come on, eh. Alright Gordon, come on, eh. I just, can I just say a few things about, first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady, my wife, with a wonderful smile. That reminds me, I must post that letter.\" (Laughter) \"I just think, you know, what people forget, Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well. Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'\" (Laughter) \"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said, 'Can I rely on your support for the next month?' And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.' Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before.\" (Laughter)Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 \u2014 that was to the building; the people weren't listening. But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said, \"What you as the city of London have done for financial services, we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole.\" (Laughter) When you think what's happened to financial services, and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, \"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises.\" (Laughter)But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world. This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you. Am I right?These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts. Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account? Why would you do that? Why would \u2014 It's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it? (Laughter) Asking for your bank details. And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it. It didn't have that kind of collateral. What does it have? It has fish, that's all. That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said, \"This has left us all with a very big haddock.\" (Laughter)A lot of what I do \u2014 I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them. And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult. Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful. He summed it up, really, at a dinner. He was speaking at a dinner, he said, \"Wall Street got drunk.\" (Laughter) \"And now it's got a hangover.\" And that's, you know, that's something \u2014 (Applause) And that's something we can relate to. It's certainly something he can relate to. (Laughter)And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said, \"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know. And then you got the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know. And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things we don't know we don't know.\" And being English, when I first heard that I thought, \"What a load of cock.\" And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said, the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system, it's about \u2014 they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing. In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote, \"As we can clearly see, no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy.\" Now, there is a man on top of his job. (Laughter) And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, \"Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days.\"So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of. But we have a new hope. We have a new man. America has now elected its first openly black President. (Laughter) Wonderful news. Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this? How many people here are left-handed? You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed. And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink. And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday. And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who has to write without smudging the ink.You like that one? As opposed to you could see George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there? I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it? \"Well, you know I'm sorry about that. I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.\" (Laughter) But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone. That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act, just gone like that.\"You know, it's the end of an error [sic]. I happen to believe it was a great error. I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States. But we proved them wrong in Iraq. They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda. There is now.\" (Laughter) \"But I have a message for the suicide bombers, for those people who've blown themselves up.\" (Laughter) \"We're going to find you.\" (Laughter) \"We're going to make sure you don't do it again.\" (Laughter)But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the \u2014 arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history, now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama. You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory. And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said, \"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ...\" I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would. (Laughter) But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration. And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up. And there is George Bush sitting there going, \"Heh heh heh heh ...\" (Laughter) \"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh.\" (Laughter)But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero, who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, \"Great speech.\" And then they'd listen to Demosthenes, and they'd say, \"Let's march.\" And we all want to believe in President Obama. It's rather like that line in the film \"As Good As it Gets.\" Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, \"What do you see in me?\" And Jack Nicholson just says, \"You make me want to be a better man.\"And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right? But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing. We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it. So he comes over to this country, and he says, \"We need a big fiscal stimulus.\" And everyone goes, \"Great!\" He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go, \"No, no, forget about that, absolutely not.\" Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg. He says, \"We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.\" And everyone goes, \"Great idea.\" He leaves, people go, \"No no no, we're not going to do that. 5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it.\" He goes to Prague, he says, \"We believe in a nuclear-free world.\"And it's great to have an American president who can say the word \"nuclear,\" let's just point that out first. Do you remember that? George Bush, \"A nu-ca-ler.\" Sorry, what? \"A nu-ca-ler.\" (Laughter) Could you say \"avuncular\"? \"Avunclear.\" (Laughter) Thank you very much.But he says, \"We want a nuclear-free world.\" And that day, North Korea, that very day, North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and land it before ...So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton. \"Travels the world.\" (Laughs) \"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...\" (Laughter) \"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ...\" (Laughter) \"... who said, reach out and touch ...\" (Laughter) \"... somebody's gla \u2014 hand.\" (Laughter) \"Make this world a better place, if you can. I just think that's important. I really do. And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House, because she'd have been out of our home for four years. And I, you know.\" (Laughter) \"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you.\" (Laughter)So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles: \"And the environment is so important, all we can do. My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda.\" (Laughter)Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire. Mandela, the great man Mandela. He's been honored with a statue now. The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program. \"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?\" \"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.\" (Laughter) \"I was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean. Why would I need a bloody water feature?\" (Laughter)Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the \"Japanese Essays on Idleness\" which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth. Thank you very much indeed.

When I first got the invitation,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nthey said somewhere in the thing, they said, \"15 minutes to change the world,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nyour moment onstage.\" 15 minutes to change the world.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nI don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWell, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nnow we've seen that wonderful demonstration\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nof the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\n300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nAnd now it's an idea.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nIt's great. It's fantastic.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBut you do meet some fantastic people,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\npeople who look at the world in a totally different way.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nYesterday, David Deutsch, another one\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwho covered most of what I was going to say.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nBut when you think of the world in that way,\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nit does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI mean, he must walk in and they will say,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\n\"Would you like a macchiato,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nor a latte, or an Americano,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nor a cappuccino?\"\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nAnd he'll say,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\n\"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.\"\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\n\"How can your coffee be true?\"\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd they will say,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\n\"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?\"\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nFantastic.

She's running out of time, she said.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd I think, \"I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.\"\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThis man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd there he is.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:32.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThat's how TED brings these connections together.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI wasn't here on Tuesday.

He goes to Strasburg.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nHe says, \"We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd everyone goes, \"Great idea.\"\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nHe leaves, people go, \"No no no, we're not going to do that.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\n5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it.\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nHe goes to Prague, he says, \"We believe in a nuclear-free world.\"\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd it's great to have an American president who can say the word \"nuclear,\"\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nlet's just point that out first.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nDo you remember that? George Bush, \"A nu-ca-ler.\"\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nSorry, what? \"A nu-ca-ler.\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nCould you say \"avuncular\"? \"Avunclear.\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nBut he says, \"We want a nuclear-free world.\"\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nAnd that day, North Korea, that very day,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nNorth Korea is just seeing if it can\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\njust get one over Japan --\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:26.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand land it before ...\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nSo, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\n\"Travels the world.\" (Laughs)\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:41.958\n\"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...\"\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\n\"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ...\"\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\n\"... who said, reach out and touch ...\"\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\n\"... somebody's gla -- hand.\"\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\n\"Make this world a better place, if you can.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nI just think that's important. I really do.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbecause she'd have been out of our home for four years.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nAnd I, you know.\" (Laughter)\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\n\"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you.\"\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n\"And the environment is so important, all we can do.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nMy wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\npush emissions up her agenda.\"\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nOr, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nMandela, the great man Mandela.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nHe's been honored with a statue now.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe previous highest honor he had in Britain\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nwas a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\n\"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?\"\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\n\"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.\"\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\n\"I was held in prison\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nfor nearly 30 years\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\non an island\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nin the middle of the ocean.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nWhy would I need a bloody water feature?\"\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nVery quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nfrom the \"Japanese Essays on Idleness\"\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nwhich said it's nice to have something which is unfinished\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nbecause it implies there is still room for growth.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThank you very much indeed.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:31.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The art of the interview", "duration": "1254", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/marc_pachter_the_art_of_the_interview", "transcript": "The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives, amazing people. And that's what it's about. We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it. And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today. I'm going to talk about a program I started there, which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore, and they're amazing people, and we want to deliver them to future generations. So, how do we do that? And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series. And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview.And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you the great hits of that program, as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation, what you try to find out about them, and when people deliver and when they don't and why.Now, I had two preconditions. One was that they be American. That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery, it's created to look at American lives. That was easy, but then I made the decision, maybe arbitrary, that they needed to be people of a certain age, which at that point, when I created this program, seemed really old. Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties. For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.And why did I do that? Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture. And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk. But the second part of it \u2014 and the older I get, the more convinced I am that that's true. It's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out. That's the one advantage that older people have. Well, they have other, little bit of advantage, but they also have some disadvantages, but the one thing they or we have is that we've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out. So, we can then go back in our lives, if we've got an interviewer who gets that, and begin to reflect on how we got there. All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited.So, I thought okay, now, what is it going to take to make this work? There are many kinds of interviews. We know them. There are the journalist interviews, which are the interrogation that is expected. This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee. Then there's the celebrity interview, where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers. That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that. That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process. Fair enough.But I wanted interviews that were different. I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic, which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self-revelation. By the way, this was always done in public. This was not an oral history program. This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual, and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that. I didn't know it coming into it. And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright, and that was six months after he'd had a stroke. And he had never appeared in public since that point. This was not a devastating stroke, but it did affect his speaking and so forth. And I thought it was worth a chance, he thought it was worth a chance, and so we got up on the stage, and we had an hour conversation about his life, and after that a woman rushed up to me, essentially did, and she said, \"Where did you train as a doctor?\"And I said, \"I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.\"And she said, \"Well, something very weird was happening. When he started a sentence, particularly in the early parts of the interview, and paused, you gave him the word, the bridge to get to the end of the sentence, and by the end of it, he was speaking complete sentences on his own.\" I didn't know what was going on, but I was so part of the process of getting that out.So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy, or empathy, at any rate, is what's critical to this kind of interview. But then I began to think of other things. Who makes a great interview in this context? It had nothing to do with their intellect, the quality of their intellect. Some of them were very brilliant, some of them were, you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals, but it was never about that. It was about their energy. It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives. I'm convinced of it. And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young. These were people through their 90s.In fact, the first person I interviewed was George Abbott, who was 97, and Abbott was filled with the life force \u2014 I guess that's the way I think about it \u2014 filled with it. And so he filled the room, and we had an extraordinary conversation. He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent, for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two. And, in fact, he did wind up opening up \u2014 by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways. He subsequently got married again at 102, so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.But after the interview, I got a call, very gruff voice, from a woman. I didn't know who she was, and she said, \"Did you get George Abbott to talk?\"And I said, \"Yeah. Apparently I did.\"And she said, \"I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton, and I could never do it.\" And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.So, you know, you want energy, you want the life force, but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing. The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest. Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest, because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them, and they sit there and they say, \"Aw, shucks, it was an accident.\" There's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them.The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer. The journalist who did \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\" This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months, and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, \"Oh, I just happened to be there. Didn't matter.\" Whatever. Awful. I never would ever agree to interview a modest person. They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you.But it comes down, in the end, to how do you get through all the barriers we have. All of us are public and private beings, and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self, there's no point in it. It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial, and we all have infomercials about our lives. We know the great lines, we know the great moments, we know what we're not going to share, and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody. This wasn't \u2014 and some of you will remember Mike Wallace's old interviews \u2014 tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say, to break out of their own cocoon of the public self, and the more public they had been, the more entrenched that person, that outer person was. And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series. It all has to do with that shell that most of us have, and particularly certain people.There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce. It'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you. She did so much. She was a playwright. She did an extraordinary play called \"The Women.\" She was a congresswoman when there weren't very many congresswomen. She was editor of Vanity Fair, one of the great phenomenal women of her day. And, incidentally, I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right. She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left. And, in fact, when we did the interview \u2014 I did the living self-portrait with her \u2014 there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet, just enjoying her presence.And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake, because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes. We never talk before that because if you talk before, you don't get it on the stage. So she and I had a delightful conversation.We were on the stage and then \u2014 by the way, spectacular. It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look. She was in a great evening gown. She was 80, almost that day of the interview, and there she was and there I was, and I just proceeded into the questions. And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable. Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss, and I was basically up there \u2014 any of you in the moderate-to-full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage. And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.And I began to wonder what was going on, and you think while you talk, and basically, I thought, I got it. When we were alone, I was her audience. Now I'm her competitor for the audience. That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that, and so then I asked her a question \u2014 I didn't know how I was going to get out of it \u2014 I asked her a question about her days as a playwright, and again, characteristically, instead of saying, \"Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,\" she said, \"Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright. Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.\" But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear, and she said, \"Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress. It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman, and I got up there,\" and she went on and on, \"And then I got on the stage.\"And then she turned to me and said, \"And you know what those young actors did? They upstaged me.\" And she said, \"Do you know what that is?\" Just withering in her contempt.And I said, \"I'm learning.\"(Laughter)And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle, and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like.I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce. Again, a remarkable person. I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force, I'm attracted to her. And the way she died \u2014 she had, toward the end, a brain tumor. That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine, and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.And she was in horrible pain. We all knew that. She stayed in her room. Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes. The usual sort of thing. Then at a certain moment, the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed. The public self, the beauty, the intellect, and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again. She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up, and this is just a brief reference. It wasn't this arm-wrestle, but it was a little surprising for the person involved. I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago. And we were sitting there, and almost toward the beginning of the interview, I turned to him and I said, \"Steve,\" or \"Mr. Martin, it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods. Was yours unhappy?\"And he looked at me, you know, as if to say, \"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?\" And then he turned to me, not stupidly, and he said, \"What was your childhood like?\"And I said \u2014 these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate \u2014 and I said, \"My father was loving and supportive, which is why I'm not funny.\"(Laughter)And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story. His father was an SOB, and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood, but then we were off and running. So the question is: What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?Now, these are arm wrestle questions, but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really, very often, are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked. And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers. Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone. He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson, spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson, and by the way, at one point I asked him, \"Would you like to have met him?\"And he said, \"Well, of course, but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him, because I got to read all of his letters.\" So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.And I asked him one question. I said, \"Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?\"And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him, and he said, \"Well ...\" \u2014 I'm going to do a bad southern accent. Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally. But he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm afraid so.\" He said, \"You know, I've read everything, and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.\"And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had, because he saw the letters. He said, \"But I understand that.\" He said, \"I understand that.\" He said, \"We southerners do like a smooth surface, so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.\"And he said, \"Now, John Adams was too honest.\" And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house, and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts, and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. She was the New Englander and abrasive, and he was this courtly fellow.But really the most important question I ever asked, and most of the times when I talk about it, people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty, but I promise you it was the right question. This was to Agnes de Mille. Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history. She basically created the dances in \"Oklahoma,\" transforming the American theater. An amazing woman.At the time that I proposed to her that \u2014 by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary \u2014 but proposed to her that she come on. She said, \"Come to my apartment.\" She lived in New York. \"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes, and then we'll decide whether we proceed.\"And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment, and she called out to me, and she was in bed. I had known that she had had a stroke, and that was some 10 years before. And so she spent almost all of her life in bed, but \u2014 I speak of the life force \u2014 her hair was askew. She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.And she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side. She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned. She said, \"I keep this will by my bed, memento mori, and I change it all the time just because I want to.\" And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life. I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.She agreed. She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on. Half of her body was stricken, the other half not. She was, of course, done up for the occasion, but this was a woman in great physical distress. And we had a conversation, and then I asked her this unthinkable question. I said, \"Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?\"And the audience just \u2014 you know, they're always on the side of the interviewee, and they felt that this was a kind of assault, but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life. And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful, and she literally turned \u2014 here she was, in this broken body \u2014 and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth, and then she said, \"And then puberty hit.\"And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face, and how she could no longer count on her beauty, and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given. And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company, and in that process, she made a number of decisions. First of all, was that dance, even though it hadn't been offered to her, was her life. And secondly, she had better be, although she did dance for a while, a choreographer because then her looks didn't matter. But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.It was an amazing privilege to do this series. There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence. The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions, so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are, and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews. Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family.Thank you very much.", "id": 708, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nThe National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nto presenting great American lives,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\namazing people.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nAnd that's what it's about.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nWe use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nI'm going to talk about a program I started there,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nwhich, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nI started to worry about the fact\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nthat a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand they're amazing people,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nand we want to deliver them to future generations.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nmy being a brush in the hand\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nof amazing people who would come and I would interview.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe great hits of that program,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nas to give you this whole notion\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nof how you encounter people in that kind of situation,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nwhat you try to find out about them,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand when people deliver and when they don't and why.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nNow, I had two preconditions.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nOne was that they be American.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThat's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nit's created to look at American lives.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nThat was easy, but then I made the decision,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nmaybe arbitrary,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nthat they needed to be people of a certain age,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwhich at that point, when I created this program,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nseemed really old.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nSixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nFor obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd why did I do that?\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nWell, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd I thought really what we need is an elders program\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nto just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nBut the second part of it -- and the older I get,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthe more convinced I am that that's true.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nIt's amazing what people will say when they know\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhow the story turned out.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThat's the one advantage that older people have.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWell, they have other, little bit of advantage,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nbut they also have some disadvantages,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nbut the one thing they or we have is that\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nwe've reached the point in life\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nwhere we know how the story turned out.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nSo, we can then go back in our lives,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nif we've got an interviewer who gets that,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand begin to reflect on how we got there.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAll of those accidents that wound up\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\ncreating the life narrative that we inherited.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo, I thought okay, now,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwhat is it going to take to make this work?\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nThere are many kinds of interviews. We know them.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThere are the journalist interviews,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhich are the interrogation that is expected.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThis is somewhat against resistance\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand caginess on the part of the interviewee.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThen there's the celebrity interview,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nwhere it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThat's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThat's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nas Nixon in that process.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nFair enough.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nBut I wanted interviews that were different.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwhich is to say, to feel what they wanted to say\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand to be an agent of their self-revelation.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBy the way, this was always done in public.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThis was not an oral history program.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nThis was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand having me be the brush in their self-portrait.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nNow, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI didn't know it coming into it.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd the only reason I really know that\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nis because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand that was six months after he'd had a stroke.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd he had never appeared in public since that point.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThis was not a devastating stroke,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nbut it did affect his speaking and so forth.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nAnd I thought it was worth a chance,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nhe thought it was worth a chance,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand so we got up on the stage,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand we had an hour conversation about his life,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand after that a woman rushed up to me,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nessentially did,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand she said, \"Where did you train as a doctor?\"\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nAnd I said, \"I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.\"\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, something very weird was happening.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nWhen he started a sentence, particularly\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nin the early parts of the interview,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nand paused, you gave him the word,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nthe bridge to get to the end of the sentence,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand by the end of it,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nhe was speaking complete sentences on his own.\"\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nI didn't know what was going on,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut I was so part of the process of getting that out.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nSo I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nor empathy, at any rate,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nis what's critical to this kind of interview.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nBut then I began to think of other things.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nWho makes a great interview in this context?\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nIt had nothing to do with their intellect,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthe quality of their intellect.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSome of them were very brilliant,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nsome of them were,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nyou know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nbut it was never about that.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIt was about their energy.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nIt's energy that creates extraordinary interviews\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand extraordinary lives.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nI'm convinced of it.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nAnd it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThese were people through their 90s.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nIn fact, the first person I interviewed\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwas George Abbott, who was 97,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand Abbott was filled with the life force --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nAnd so he filled the room,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand we had an extraordinary conversation.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nHe was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nbecause he was famous for being silent,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nfor never ever saying anything\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nexcept maybe a word or two.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nAnd, in fact, he did wind up opening up --\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nby the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nHe subsequently got married again at 102,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nso he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nBut after the interview, I got a call,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nvery gruff voice, from a woman.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nI didn't know who she was,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand she said, \"Did you get George Abbott to talk?\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd I said, \"Yeah. Apparently I did.\"\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd she said, \"I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nand I could never do it.\"\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd then she made me go up with the tape of it\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand prove that George Abbott actually could talk.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nSo, you know, you want energy,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nyou want the life force,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbut you really want them also to think\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nthat they have a story worth sharing.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThe worst interviews that you can ever have\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nare with people who are modest.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nNever ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nbecause all of these people have been assembled\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nto listen to them, and they sit there and they say,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\n\"Aw, shucks, it was an accident.\"\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThere's nothing that ever happens that justifies\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\npeople taking good hours of the day to be with them.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nThe worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nThe journalist who did \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\"\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThis guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, \"Oh, I just happened to be there.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nDidn't matter.\" Whatever.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAwful.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI never would ever agree to interview a modest person.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThey have to think that they did something\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand that they want to share it with you.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBut it comes down, in the end,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nto how do you get through all the barriers we have.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAll of us are public and private beings,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nand if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthere's no point in it.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand we all have infomercials about our lives.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWe know the great lines, we know the great moments,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwe know what we're not going to share,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nThis wasn't -- and some of you will remember\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nMike Wallace's old interviews --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ntough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nto break out of their own cocoon of the public self,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand the more public they had been,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthe more entrenched that person, that outer person was.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthat happened in this interview series.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt all has to do with that shell that most of us have,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand particularly certain people.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThere's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nIt'll be your generational determinant\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nas to whether her name means much to you.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nShe did so much. She was a playwright.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nShe did an extraordinary play called \"The Women.\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nShe was a congresswoman\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhen there weren't very many congresswomen.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nShe was editor of Vanity Fair,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\none of the great phenomenal women of her day.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd, incidentally, I call her\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthe Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nShe was sort of adored on the Right\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nthe way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd, in fact, when we did the interview --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nI did the living self-portrait with her --\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthere were three former directors of the CIA\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nbasically sitting at her feet,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\njust enjoying her presence.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nbecause I always have preliminary talks with these people\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nfor just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWe never talk before that because if you talk before,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nyou don't get it on the stage.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo she and I had a delightful conversation.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nWe were on the stage and then --\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nby the way, spectacular.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nIt was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nShe was in a great evening gown.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nShe was 80, almost that day of the interview,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand there she was and there I was,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand I just proceeded into the questions.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand I was basically up there -- any of you\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nin the moderate-to-full entertainment world\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nknow what it is to die onstage.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd I began to wonder what was going on,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand you think while you talk,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand basically, I thought, I got it.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWhen we were alone, I was her audience.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nNow I'm her competitor for the audience.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThat's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nand so then I asked her a question --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nI didn't know how I was going to get out of it --\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nI asked her a question about her days as a playwright,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand again, characteristically,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ninstead of saying, \"Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,\"\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nshe said, \"Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nMost people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.\"\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nBut I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand she said, \"Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand I got up there,\" and she went on and on, \"And then I got on the stage.\"\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd then she turned to me and said,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\n\"And you know what those young actors did?\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nThey upstaged me.\" And she said, \"Do you know what that is?\"\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nJust withering in her contempt.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd I said, \"I'm learning.\"\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nand then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nof what her life really was like.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nI have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAgain, a remarkable person.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nI'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI'm attracted to her.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nThat's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand very few of us were invited to a dinner party.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd she was in horrible pain.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nWe all knew that.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nShe stayed in her room.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nEverybody came. The butler passed around canapes.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThe usual sort of thing.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThen at a certain moment, the door opened\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThe public self, the beauty, the intellect,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nand she walked around and talked to every person there\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand then went back into the room and was never seen again.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nShe wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nNow, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nand this is just a brief reference.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nIt wasn't this arm-wrestle,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nbut it was a little surprising for the person involved.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nI interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd we were sitting there,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand almost toward the beginning of the interview,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nI turned to him and I said, \"Steve,\" or \"Mr. Martin,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nit is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nWas yours unhappy?\"\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd he looked at me, you know, as if to say,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\n\"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?\"\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd then he turned to me, not stupidly,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand he said, \"What was your childhood like?\"\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand I said, \"My father was loving and supportive,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nwhich is why I'm not funny.\"\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nHis father was an SOB,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nand, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut then we were off and running.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSo the question is:\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWhat is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nNow, these are arm wrestle questions,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nbut I want to tell you about questions\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthat are more related to empathy\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand that really, very often, are the questions\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthat people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nOne was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAgain, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nHe did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nspent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nand by the way, at one point I asked him,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\n\"Would you like to have met him?\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nAnd he said, \"Well, of course,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbut actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nbecause I got to read all of his letters.\"\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nSo, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I asked him one question.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI said, \"Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?\"\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nAnd here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand connecting with him,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nand he said, \"Well ...\" -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nDumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"I'm afraid so.\"\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nHe said, \"You know, I've read everything,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nand sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit.\"\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd he basically was saying that this was a man\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nwho lied more than he wished he had,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nbecause he saw the letters.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nHe said, \"But I understand that.\" He said, \"I understand that.\"\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nHe said, \"We southerners do like a smooth surface,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nso that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation.\"\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd he said, \"Now, John Adams was too honest.\"\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand he and she had exactly the relationship\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nof Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nShe was the New Englander and abrasive,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand he was this courtly fellow.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nBut really the most important question I ever asked,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand most of the times when I talk about it,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:40.958\npeople kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nbut I promise you it was the right question.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nThis was to Agnes de Mille.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nAgnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nShe basically created the dances in \"Oklahoma,\"\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\ntransforming the American theater.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nAn amazing woman.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nAt the time that I proposed to her that --\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nby the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nbut proposed to her that she come on.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nShe said, \"Come to my apartment.\"\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nShe lived in New York.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n\"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand then we'll decide whether we proceed.\"\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nAnd so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nand she called out to me, and she was in bed.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nI had known that she had had a stroke,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nand that was some 10 years before.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nAnd so she spent almost all of her life in bed,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nbut -- I speak of the life force --\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nher hair was askew.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nShe wasn't about to make up for this occasion.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nAnd she was sitting there surrounded by books,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nand her most interesting possession she felt at that moment\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nwas her will, which she had by her side.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nShe wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nShe said, \"I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand I change it all the time\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\njust because I want to.\"\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nAnd she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nI thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nShe agreed.\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nShe came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nHalf of her body was stricken, the other half not.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nShe was, of course, done up for the occasion,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nbut this was a woman in great physical distress.\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd we had a conversation,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nand then I asked her this unthinkable question.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nI said, \"Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?\"\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nAnd the audience just -- you know,\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nthey're always on the side of the interviewee,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nand they felt that this was a kind of assault,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nbut this was the question she had\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nwanted somebody to ask her whole life.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nAnd she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nand she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nand she turned to the audience and\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\ndescribed herself as the fair demoiselle\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nwith her red hair and her light steps and so forth,\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nand then she said, \"And then puberty hit.\"\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd she began to talk about things that had happened\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nto her body and her face,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nand how she could no longer count on her beauty,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nand her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:41.958\nfor whom all the ballet lessons were given.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nAnd she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nand in that process, she made a number of decisions.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nFirst of all, was that dance, even though\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nit hadn't been offered to her, was her life.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nAnd secondly, she had better be,\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nalthough she did dance for a while, a choreographer\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nbecause then her looks didn't matter.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nBut she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nIt was an amazing privilege to do this series.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nThere were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nThe key point was empathy\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nbecause everybody in their lives\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nis really waiting for people to ask them questions,\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nso that they can be truthful about who they are\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nand how they became what they are,\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nand I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nJust be that way with your friends\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.958\nand particularly the older members of your family.\n\n00:20:43.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "How low-cost eye care can be world-class", "duration": "1047", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/thulasiraj_ravilla_how_low_cost_eye_care_can_be_world_class", "transcript": "Good morning. I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.(Music)Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no, what use do we have for a blind woman? I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it, but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity, their independence, and their status in the family. So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. And the irony is that they don't need to be.A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see. If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses, then almost one in five Indians will require eye care, a staggering 200 million people. Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V. He started this with no money. He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model. And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.The last three decades, we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people. Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries. A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients, send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations, and, on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation.(Music)Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village, and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being, you seem to be one with him. Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it. An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her. When we grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify ourselves with all that is in the world, so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing.(Applause)This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it. But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently, and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple. They feel they can train people all over the world, irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things, to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places.Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us. He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's.Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care, techniques, methods, all in the same way, and make it available in every corner of the world. The problem of blindness is gone.TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, as American or African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same. And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service, and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem, we are talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.And then so, one had to constantly innovate. And one of the early innovations, which still continues, is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner, and here is one such event. Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma.And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree. But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it. So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital.And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it. They receive surgery the following day, and then they will stay for a day or two, and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from, and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.(Applause)And this happens several thousand times each year. It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem? We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then, to our dismay, we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.So we had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers. These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. They receive comprehensive eye exams. We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served, which is over 50,000 people. And the second year went up to 75 percent. So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital.And how much will they pay for this? We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.(Applause)The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care? We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing \u2014 I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence.So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market, because it focused on the non-customer, and then by reaching the unreached, we're able to significantly grow the market.The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists? So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready. So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.And then to support the surgeon, we require a certain workforce. And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization. They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks. They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost. So, putting all this together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else.(Applause)This is a very busy table, but what this really is conveying is that, when it comes to quality, we have put in very good quality-assurance systems. As a result, our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom, and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.(Applause)So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less. And we were helped by the market inefficiency. I think that has been a big savior, even now. And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus.The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes. The revenues increase at a higher level, giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.(Applause)But this really requires going beyond what we do, or what we have done, if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things. We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables. We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well.The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology? There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit. And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market, and they're used in about 120-odd countries.To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries? So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind. What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does, near a half-million surgeries as a whole country. And we do about 300,000. And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care. So we're really comparing apples to apples. We looked at cost. (Laughter)(Applause)So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. I think there is more to it. I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well. Maybe there is \u2014 the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables, or regulations, their defensive practice. So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again.(Laughter)Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm. You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on. There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side.Now, how do you create compassion? Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it? There are a bit harder issues. And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. It is ourselves we are helping. It is ourselves we are healing.TR: Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 709, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nGood

highly patient-centric organization\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand systems that support it.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nBut on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nDr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThey feel they can train people all over the world,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nirrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nto produce a product in the same way\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand deliver it in the same manner\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nin hundreds of places.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nLarry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand none of it made any sense to us.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHe wanted to create a franchise,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\na mechanism of delivery of eye care\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwith the efficiency of McDonald's.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nDr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\ntechniques, methods, all in the same way,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nand make it available in every corner of the world.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThe problem of blindness is gone.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nTR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nas American or African,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthe problem is the same, the treatment is the same.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand that was the fundamental principle that we followed\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwhen we designed the delivery systems.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nwe are talking of millions of people,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nvery little resource to deal with it,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand then lots of logistics and affordability issues.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAnd then so, one had to constantly innovate.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd one of the early innovations, which still continues,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nis to create ownership in the community to the problem,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand then engage with them as a partner,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand here is one such event.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nHere a community camp just organized\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nby the community themselves,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwhere they find a place, organize volunteers,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nand then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand then determine what further testing should be done,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand then those tests are done by technicians\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwho check for glasses,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nor check for glaucoma.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand then prescribes a line of treatment,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nusually under a tree.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nBut they get glasses in the frames of their choice,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand that's very important because I think glasses,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nin addition to helping people see,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nis also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo they get it in about 20 minutes\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand those who require surgery, are counseled,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand then there are buses waiting,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhich will transport them to the base hospital.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nmany people like this would probably never get services,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand certainly not when they most need it.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThey receive surgery the following day,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand then they will stay for a day or two,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand then they are put back on the buses\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto be taken back to where they came from,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand where their families will be waiting to take them back home.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd this happens several thousand times each year.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nIt may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nvery efficient process,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nbut we looked at, are we solving the problem?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nWe did a study, a scientifically designed process,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand then, to our dismay,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwe found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nSo we had to do something different,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nso we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThese are truly paperless offices\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwith completely electronic medical records and so on.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey receive comprehensive eye exams.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nWe kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThe effect of this has been that, within the first year,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwe really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nwhich is over 50,000 people.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd the second year went up to 75 percent.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo I think we have a process by which\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nwe can really penetrate into the market\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand reach everyone who needs it,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand in this process of using technology, make sure\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthat most don't need to come to the base hospital.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nAnd how much will they pay for this?\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nWe fixed the pricing, taking into account\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhat they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nso they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThe other challenge was, how do you give high-tech\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nor more advanced treatment and care?\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nWe designed a van with a VSAT,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwhich sends out images of patients to the base hospital\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nwhere it is diagnosed,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nand then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nit gets printed out, the patient gets it,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nand then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nI mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nand then this happens as a way of\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nbridging the technology competence.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbecause it focused on the non-customer,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand then by reaching the unreached,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nwe're able to significantly grow the market.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwhen you have very few ophthalmologists?\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSo what is in this video is a surgeon operating,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nand then you see on the other side,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nanother patient is getting ready.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo, as they finish the surgery,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthey just swing the microscope over,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthe tables are placed so that their distance is just right,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwe're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd then to support the surgeon,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwe require a certain workforce.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd then we focused on village girls that we recruited,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand then they really are the backbone of the organization.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nThey do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThey do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWith the result we have very high productivity,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nvery high quality at very, very low cost.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nSo, putting all this together, what really happened was\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthe productivity of our staff was\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nsignificantly higher than anyone else.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:42.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThis is a very busy table,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbut what this really is conveying is that,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nwhen it comes to quality, we have put in\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nvery good quality-assurance systems.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAs a result, our complications are significantly lower\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthan what has been reported in the United Kingdom,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand you don't see those kind of numbers very often.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nSo the final part of the puzzle is,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nhow do you make all this work financially,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nespecially when the people can't pay for it?\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nnothing more, and often much less.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd we were helped by the market inefficiency.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nI think that has been a big savior, even now.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhat you have as a surplus.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nThe result has been, over the years,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthe expenditure has increased with volumes.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThe revenues increase at a higher level,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\ngiving us a healthy margin\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nwhile you're treating a large number of people for free.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nI think in absolute terms,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nlast year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nspent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nBut this really requires going beyond what we do,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nor what we have done,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nif you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nAnd what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nWe created competition for ourselves,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand then we made eye care affordable\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nby making low-cost consumables.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe proactively and systematically\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\npromoted these practices to many hospitals in India,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nmany in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nThe impact of this has been that these hospitals,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin the second year after our consultation,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nare double their output\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand then achieve financial recovery as well.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nThe other part was how do you address\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthis increase in cost of technology?\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThere was a time when we failed to negotiate\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nthe [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nso we set up a manufacturing unit.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nAnd then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nto about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nToday, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand they're used in about 120-odd countries.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nTo conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nor is it just India or developing countries?\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWhat it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nof the volume of what the UK does,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nnear a half-million surgeries as a whole country.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAnd we do about 300,000.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd then we train about 50 ophthalmologists\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nagainst the 70 trained by them,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\ncomparable quality, both in training and in patient care.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo we're really comparing apples to apples.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe looked at cost.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:13.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo, I think it is simple to say\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\njust because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nI think there is more to it.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nI mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nMaybe there is --\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthe solution to the cost could be in productivity,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nmaybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nor in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nor regulations, their defensive practice.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nSo, I think decoding this can probably bring\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nanswers to most developed countries\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nincluding the U.S., and maybe\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nObama's ratings can go up again.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nAnother insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nin conditions where the problem is very large,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwhich cuts across all economic strata,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nwhere we have a good solution,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI think the process I described,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nyou know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\ncan give an answer,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nand there are many which fit this paradigm.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nYou take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThere are many where this paradigm can now play,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nbut I think probably one of the most challenging things\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nis on the softer side.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nNow, how do you create compassion?\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nNow, how do you make people own the problem,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nwant to do something about it?\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nThere are a bit harder issues.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nAnd I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nSo I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nDr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nwe identify with all that is in the world\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nso there is no exploitation.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nIt is ourselves we are helping.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nIt is ourselves we are healing.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nTR: Thank you very much.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Pop culture in the Arab world", "duration": "305", "url":

Because this is my first time at TED, I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit. Yes. That's right. This is Barbie. She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever. (Laughter) But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face. This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres. They have different interests. They have divergent values. And should they ever come in contact ... well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different. Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic. I want to show you two examples. The first is 4Shbab. It means \"for youth\" and it's a new Arab TV channel.(Video): Video clips from across the globe. The USA.\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side \u266b\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266b\u266b Everything will be all right \u266b\u266b I am not afraid to stand alone \u266bThe Arab world.(Music)\u266b She was preserved by modesty of the religion \u266b \u266b She was adorned by the light of the Quran \u266bShereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV. Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Ha\u00efba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives. He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos. 4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels. And they look something like this. (Music)That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl. In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind. But it's not about fire and brimstone either. Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges.Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. And it's called \"The 99.\" Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format. \"The 99.\" The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others. So, for example, there is the character of Noora. She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone. Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions.Now, \"The 99\" is not just a comic book. It's now a theme park. There is an animated series in the works. And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with \"The 99\" to beat injustice wherever they find it.\"The 99\" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization. We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.Now, while 4Shbab and \"The 99\" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this. Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern. After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: \"We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.\" And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed. Thank you. (Applause)", "id": 710, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nHello, everyone.

At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners in Italian jails. He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades. Now, as many of you may remember, the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization which was very active in Italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. As part of their strategy the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers. They sat in silence through their trails, waving occasionally at family and friends.In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle. And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk, and tell their story. And I was one of those people. When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me, he said that the female members of the organization had actually supported my name. In particular, one person had put it forward. She was my childhood friend. She had joined the Red Brigades and became a leader of the organization.Naturally, I didn't know that until the day she was arrested. In fact, I read it in the newspaper. At the time of the phone call I just had a baby, I successfully completed a management buyout to the company I was working with, and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home and touring the high-security prisons. But this is exactly what I did because I wanted to know what had turned my best friend into a terrorist, and why she'd never tried to recruit me. (Laughter) (Applause)So, this is exactly what I did. Now, I found the answer very quickly. I actually had failed the psychological profiling of a terrorist. The center committee of the Red Brigades had judged me too single-minded and too opinionated to become a good terrorist. My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist because she was very good at following orders. She also embraced violence. Because she believed that the only way to unblock what, at the time, was known as a blocked democracy, Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle.At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades, I also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology, but actually was ruled by economics. They were constantly short of cash. They were constantly searching for cash. Now, contrary to what many people believe, terrorism is actually a very expensive business. I'll give you an idea. In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades on a yearly basis was seven million dollars. This is roughly between 100 and 150 million, today.Now, you know, if you live underground it's really hard to produce this amount of money. But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades, and then, later on, other arms organizations, including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East, everybody was extremely reluctant to talk about ideology, or politics. Because they had no idea. The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership, which, generally, is never more than five to seven people. All the others do, day in and day out, is search for money.Once, for example, I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades. It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing. He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat. And he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the Red Brigades and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth from Lebanon, where he would pick up Soviet weapons from the PLO, and then carry them all the way to Sardinia where the other arms organization from Europe would go and take their share of the arms. For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee, which went to fund their organization.So, because I am a trained economist and I think in economic terms, all of the sudden I thought, maybe there is something here. Maybe there is a link, a commercial link, between one organization and another one. But it was only when I interviewed Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades, the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro, Italian former prime minister, that I finally realized that terrorism is actually business. I was having lunch with him in a high-security prison in Italy. And as we were eating, I had the distinct feeling that I was back in the city of London, having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist. This guy thought in the same way I did.So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism. Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research. In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy. You know, that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism. So, in the end, I took a decision that, in retrospect, did change my life. I sold my company, and funded the research myself.And what I discovered is this parallel reality, another international economic system, which runs parallel to our own, which has been created by arms organizations since the end of World War II. And what is even more shocking is that this system has followed, step by step, the evolution of our own system, of our Western capitalism. And there are three main stages. The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.The second one is the privatization of terrorism. And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism. So, state sponsor of terrorism, feature of the Cold War. This is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy, along the periphery of the sphere of influence, fully funding arms organizations. A mix of legal and illegal activities is used. So, the link between crime and terror is established very early on.And here is the best example, the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA, legally funded by the U.S. Congress, illegally funded by the Reagan administration via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair. Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s, and some groups successfully carry out the privatization of terrorism. So, they gain independence from the sponsor, and start funding themselves.Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities. So, Arafat used to get a percentage of the smuggling of hashish from Bek\u00e1a Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria. And the IRA, which control the private transportation system in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing. So, every single time that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast without knowing, actually, was funding the IRA.But the great change came, of course, with globalization and deregulation. This is when arms organization were able to link up, also financially, with each other. But above all, they started to do serious business with the world of crime. And together they money-laundered their dirty business through the same channel. This is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization Al Qaeda. This is an organization that can raise money across border. But also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country.Now, deregulation also brought back rogue economics. So what is rogue economics? Rogue economics is a force which is constantly lurking in the background of history. It comes back at times of great transformation, globalization being one of those transformations. It is at this times in which politics actually loses control of the economy, and the economy becomes a rogue force working against us. It has happened before in history. It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire. It has happened with Industrial Revolution. And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.Now, I calculated how big was this international economic system composed by crime, terror, and illegal economy, before 9-11. And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars. It is trillions, it's not billions. This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom, soon will be more, considering where this country is going. (Laughter)Now, until 9-11, the bulk of all this money flew into the U.S. economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars and the money laundering was taking place inside the United States. The entry point, of course, of most of this money were the off-shore facilities. So, this was a vital injection of cash into the U.S. economy. Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply, the U.S. money supply is the amount of dollars that the Federal Reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars, which, of course, reflects the growth of the economy.So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s a growing number of these dollars was actually leaving the United States, never to come back. These were money taken out in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course. These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers. These were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy. So, you see, what is the relationship?The United States actually is a country that is the reserve currency of the world. What does it mean? That means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have. It can borrow against the total amount of dollars in circulation in the world. This privilege is called seigniorage. No other country can do that. All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom, can borrow only against the amount of money in circulation inside its own borders.So, here is the implication of the relationship between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy. The U.S. in the 1990s was borrowing against the growth of the terror, illegal and criminal economy. This is how close we are with this world. Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11, because George Bush launched the War on Terror. Part of the War on Terror was the introduction of the Patriot Act. Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act is a legislation that greatly reduces the liberties of Americans in order to protect them against terrorism.But there is a section of the Patriot Act which refers specifically to finance. And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation. What the Patriot Act did was to prohibit U.S. bank, and U.S.-registered foreign banks from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities. It closed that door between the money laundering in dollars, and the U.S. economy. It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities the right to monitor any dollar transaction taking place anywhere in the world.Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking. All the bankers said to their clients, \"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.\" Now, the Euro was a newly born currency of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment. And this is what people did. Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority to check their relationship, to monitor their relationship with their clientele. The same thing happened, of course, in the world of crime and terror. People simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the United States into Europe.Why did this happen? This happened because the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation. It was introduced only in the United States. And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars. In Europe, a similar legislation was not introduced. So, within six months Europe became the epicenter of the money-laundering activities of the world. So, this is how incredible are the relationship between the world of crime and the world of terror, and our own life.So, why did I tell you this story? I told you this story because you must understand that there is a world that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers, including the personal relationship that you have with friends and family. You got to question everything that is told to you, including what I just told you today. (Laughter) This is the only way for you to step into the dark side, and have a look at it. And believe me, it's going to be scary. It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you. And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

00:00:17.958\nactually interacts with our daily life.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\n15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nAt the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nin Italian jails.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nHe asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nNow, as many of you may remember,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthe Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwhich was very active in Italy\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nfrom the 1960s until the mid-1980s.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nAs part of their strategy\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nthe Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThey sat in silence through their trails,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwaving occasionally at family and friends.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nIn 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand tell their story.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I was one of those people.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nWhen I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nhe said that the female members of the organization\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nhad actually supported my name.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nIn particular, one person had put it forward.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nShe was my childhood friend.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nShe had joined the Red Brigades\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand became a leader of the organization.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nNaturally, I didn't know that\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nuntil the day she was arrested.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nIn fact, I read it in the newspaper.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAt the time of the phone call\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nI just had a baby,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nI successfully completed a management buyout\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nto the company I was working with,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nand the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand touring the high-security prisons.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nBut this is exactly what I did\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nbecause I wanted to know\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nwhat had turned my best friend\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\ninto a terrorist,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand why she'd never tried to recruit me.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nSo, this is exactly what I did.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nNow, I found the answer very quickly.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nI actually had failed\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthe psychological profiling of a terrorist.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nThe center committee of the Red Brigades\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nhad judged me too single-minded\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand too opinionated to become a good terrorist.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nMy friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbecause she was very good at following orders.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nShe also embraced violence.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nBecause she believed that the only way\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nto unblock what, at the time,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwas known as a blocked democracy,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nItaly, a country run by the same party for 35 years\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwas the arms struggle.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAt the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nI also discovered that their life was not ruled\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nby politics or ideology,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nbut actually was ruled by economics.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThey were constantly short of cash.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nThey were constantly searching for cash.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nNow, contrary to what many people believe,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nterrorism is actually a very expensive business.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nI'll give you an idea.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nIn the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\non a yearly basis\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwas seven million dollars.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThis is roughly between 100\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand 150 million, today.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNow, you know, if you live underground\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nit's really hard to produce this amount of money.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nBut this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nand then, later on, other arms organizations,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nincluding members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\neverybody was extremely reluctant\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nto talk about ideology, or politics.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nBecause they had no idea.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThe political vision of a terrorist organization\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nis decided by the leadership,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nwhich, generally, is never more than five to seven people.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAll the others do, day in and day out,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nis search for money.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nOnce, for example, I was interviewing\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthis part-timer from the Red Brigades.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nHe was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd he told me that the best time of his life\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nwas when he was a member of the Red Brigades\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nand he went sailing, every summer, back and forth\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfrom Lebanon, where he would pick up\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nSoviet weapons from the PLO,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand then carry them all the way to Sardinia\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhere the other arms organization from Europe would go\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand take their share of the arms.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nFor that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhich went to fund their organization.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo, because I am a trained economist\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nand I think in economic terms,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nall of the sudden I thought,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nmaybe there is something here.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nMaybe there is a link, a commercial link,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbetween one organization and another one.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nBut it was only when I interviewed\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nMario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthe man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nItalian former prime minister,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthat I finally realized\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nthat terrorism is actually business.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI was having lunch with him\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nin a high-security prison in Italy.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd as we were eating,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nI had the distinct feeling\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthat I was back in the city of London,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nhaving lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nThis guy thought in the same way I did.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nNaturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIn fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nYou know, that woman that goes around to foundations\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nasking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo, in the end, I took a decision\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat, in retrospect, did change my life.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nI sold my company,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand funded the research myself.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd what I discovered\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nis this parallel reality,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nanother international economic system,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwhich runs parallel to our own,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nwhich has been created by arms organizations\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nsince the end of World War II.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAnd what is even more shocking\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nis that this system\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhas followed, step by step, the evolution\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nof our own system,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nof our Western capitalism.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd there are three main stages.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThe first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThe second one is the privatization of terrorism.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo, state sponsor of terrorism,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfeature of the Cold War.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThis is when the two superpowers were fighting\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\na war by proxy,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nalong the periphery of the sphere of influence,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nfully funding arms organizations.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nA mix of legal and illegal activities is used.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nSo, the link between crime and terror\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nis established very early on.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd here is the best example,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthe Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nlegally funded by the U.S. Congress,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nillegally funded by the Reagan administration\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nvia covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThen comes the late 1970s, early '80s,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand some groups successfully carry out\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthe privatization of terrorism.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nSo, they gain independence from the sponsor,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand start funding themselves.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nNow, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nSo, Arafat used to get a percentage\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nof the smuggling of hashish\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nfrom Bek\u00e1a Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd the IRA, which control the private transportation system\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo, every single time\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nthat somebody got into a taxi in Belfast\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwithout knowing, actually,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwas funding the IRA.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut the great change came, of course,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwith globalization and deregulation.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThis is when arms organization were able to link up,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nalso financially, with each other.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut above all, they started to do\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nserious business with the world of crime.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAnd together they money-laundered\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\ntheir dirty business through the same channel.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nThis is when we see the birth of the transnational\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\narms organization Al Qaeda.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThis is an organization that can raise money across border.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nBut also that is able to carry out attacks\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nin more than one country.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nNow, deregulation also brought back\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nrogue economics.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nSo what is rogue economics?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nRogue economics is a force which is constantly\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nlurking in the background of history.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nIt comes back at times of great transformation,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nglobalization being one of those transformations.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nIt is at this times in which\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\npolitics actually loses control of the economy,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand the economy becomes a rogue force\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nworking against us.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt has happened before in history.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nIt has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIt has happened with Industrial Revolution.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nNow, I calculated how big was this international\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\neconomic system composed by crime,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nterror, and illegal economy,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbefore 9-11.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIt is trillions, it's not billions.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThis is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nsoon will be more,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nconsidering where this country is going.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nNow, until 9-11,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthe bulk of all this money\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nflew into the U.S. economy\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbecause the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nand the money laundering was taking place\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\ninside the United States.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nThe entry point, of course, of most of this money\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwere the off-shore facilities.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo, this was a vital injection of cash\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\ninto the U.S. economy.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nNow, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthe U.S. money supply is the amount\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nof dollars that the Federal Reserve\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nprints every year\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nin order to satisfy\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthe increase in the demand for dollars,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwhich, of course, reflects the growth\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nof the economy.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nSo, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\na growing number of these dollars\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwas actually leaving the United States,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nnever to come back.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nThese were money taken out\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nin suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nThese were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThese were money taken out to fund\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthe growth of the terror,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nillegal and criminal economy.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo, you see, what is the relationship?\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThe United States actually is a country\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat is the reserve currency of the world.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nWhat does it mean? That means that\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nit has a privilege that other countries do not have.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nIt can borrow against the total amount of dollars\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nin circulation in the world.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThis privilege is called seigniorage.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nNo other country can do that.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAll the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\ncan borrow only against the amount of money\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nin circulation inside its own borders.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, here is the implication of the relationship\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nbetween the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nThe U.S. in the 1990s\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwas borrowing against the growth\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nof the terror, illegal and criminal economy.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nThis is how close we are with this world.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nNow, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nbecause George Bush launched the War on Terror.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nPart of the War on Terror\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nwas the introduction of the Patriot Act.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nNow, many of you know that the Patriot Act\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nis a legislation that greatly reduces\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nthe liberties of Americans in order to protect them\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nagainst terrorism.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nBut there is a section of the Patriot Act\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nwhich refers specifically to finance.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nWhat the Patriot Act did was\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto prohibit U.S. bank,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand U.S.-registered foreign banks\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nfrom doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIt closed that door between the money laundering\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nin dollars, and the U.S. economy.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nIt also gave the U.S. monetary authorities\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthe right to monitor any dollar transaction\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\ntaking place anywhere in the world.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNow, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nfinance and banking.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAll the bankers said to their clients,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\n\"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.\"\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nNow, the Euro was a newly born currency\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nof great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnd this is what people did.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nNobody wants the U.S. monetary authority\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nto check their relationship,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nto monitor their relationship with their clientele.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThe same thing happened, of course,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nin the world of crime and terror.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nPeople simply moved their money-laundering activities\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\naway from the United States\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ninto Europe.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nWhy did this happen? This happened because\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nthe Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt was introduced only in the United States.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nAnd it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIn Europe, a similar legislation\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwas not introduced.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo, within six months\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nEurope became the epicenter\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nof the money-laundering activities\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nof the world.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo, this is how incredible are the relationship\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nbetween the world of crime\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand the world of terror,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nand our own life.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nSo, why did I tell you this story?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nI told you this story because you\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nmust understand that there is a world\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nthat goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nincluding the personal relationship that you have\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwith friends and family.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nYou got to question everything that is told to you,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nincluding what I just told you today.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nThis is the only way for you\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nto step into the dark side, and have a look at it.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd believe me,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nit's going to be scary.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nIt's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAnd, above all, it's not going to be boring.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:35.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Photographing the hidden story", "duration": "680", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ryan_lobo_through_the_lens_of_compassion", "transcript": "My name is Ryan Lobo, and I've been involved in the documentary filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years. During the process of making these films I found myself taking photographs, often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.I found this photography of mine almost compulsive. And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that I had photographs that told a better story than a sometimes-sensational documentary. I felt, when I had my photographs, that I was holding on to something true, regardless of agendas or politics. In 2007, I traveled to three war zones. I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia. And over there I experienced other people's suffering, up close and personal, immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories, and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.As always, I would return to Bangalore, and often to animated discussions at friend's homes, where we would discuss various issues while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings, where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid their 14-year-old maid. I would feel very isolated during these discussions. But at the same time, I questioned myself and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling. And I decided that I had compromised, just like my friends in those discussions, where we told stories in contexts we made excuses for, rather than taking responsibility for.I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made, but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes, other substances and a woman. (Laughter) I basically decided that it was I, not the camera or the network, or anything that lay outside myself, that was the only instrument in storytelling truly worth tuning. In my life, when I tried to achieve things like success or recognition, they eluded me. Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives, and worked from a place of compassion and purpose, looking for excellence, rather than the results of it, everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.Photography transcended culture, including my own. And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible, and gives voice to people and stories without. I invite you into three recent stories of mine, which are about this way of looking, if you will, which I believe exemplify the tenets of what I like to call compassion in storytelling.In 2007 I went to Liberia, where a group of my friends and I did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress, on a very legendary and brutal war-lord named General Butt Naked. His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell where he once used to torture and murder people, including children. Joshua claims to have personally killed more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war. He got his name from fighting stark naked. And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer alive on Earth today.This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother. Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes, and enforced his command with great brutality. Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin, and they are destitute, like these young men in the image. How do you live with yourself if you know you've committed horrific crimes? Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist. And he's on a mission.We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth, visiting villages where he had once killed and raped. He seeked forgiveness, and he claims to endeavor to improve the lives of his child-soldiers. During this expedition I expected him to be killed outright, and us as well. But what I saw opened my eyes to an idea of forgiveness which I never thought possible. In the midst of incredible poverty and loss, people who had nothing absolved a man who had taken everything from them. He begs for forgiveness, and receives it from the same woman whose brother he murdered. Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here, was once a child soldier, under the General's command, until he disobeyed orders, and the General shot off both his legs. He forgives the General in this image. He risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he'd murdered.In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him. And Joshua remains silent as they vented their rage against him. This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play, with a man, surrounded by various influences, desperate to hold on to something true within himself, in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.I was intensely moved during all this. But the question is, does forgiveness and redemption replace justice? Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind standing trial for his crimes, and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia, to an audience that often includes his victims. A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state.The second story I'm going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique peace-keeping skills. Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's bloodiest civil wars, which has left more than 200,000 people dead, thousands of women scarred by rape and crime on a spectacular scale. Liberia is now home to an all-woman United Nations contingent of Indian peacekeepers.These women, many from small towns in India, help keep the peace, far away from home and family. They use negotiation and tolerance more often than an armed response. The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men. And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively. This man was very drunk, and he was very interested in my camera, until he noticed the women, who handled him with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course. (Laughter)This contingent seems to be quite lucky, and it has not sustained any casualties, even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia. And yes, all of those people killed were male. Many of the women are married with children, and they say the hardest part of their deployment was being kept away from their children.I accompanied these women on their patrols, and watched as they walked past men, many who passed very lewd comments incessantly. And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response, she said, \"Don't worry, same thing back home. We know how to deal with these fellows,\" and ignored them.In a country ravaged by violence against women, Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women to join the police force. Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left, the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar. I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story. And one editor told me that she wasn't interested in doing what she called \"manual labor stories.\"In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS, which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department. They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months. And all this against incredible logistical odds, like heat and traffic jams. Something amazing happened during this shoot. Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum, a large slum, which had caught fire. As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place. These men were terrified, as the mob attacked our vehicle.But nonetheless, despite the hostility, firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire. Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds, and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury. Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes. Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed. But the question that lingered in my mind was, what causes people to destroy fire trucks headed to their own homes? Where does such rage come from? And how are we responsible for this? 45 percent of the 14 million people who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums, which are chronically overcrowded. They lack even the most basic amenities. And this is something that is common to all our big cities.Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire, thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals were blazing away and exploding all around us. The heat was so intense, that hoses were used to cool down firefighters fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing. In India we often love to complain about our government bodies. But over here, the heads of the DFS, Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman, led the firefight with their men. Something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon. (Applause)Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested. And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy, and my own faith in humanity. However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel. And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them. Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired to do better because they were so pleased to get thank-yous rather than brick bats.It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS, at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions, read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire. Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified, regardless of the context, can help magnify these intangibles three ways, in the protagonist of the story, in the audience, and also in the storyteller. And that's the power of storytelling. Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful, and it grows. Thank you.

involved in the documentary\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nfilmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nDuring the process of making these films\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI found myself taking photographs,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\noften much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nI found this photography of mine almost compulsive.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI had photographs that told a better story\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nthan a sometimes-sensational documentary.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI felt, when I had my photographs,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nthat I was holding on to something true,\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nregardless of agendas or politics.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIn 2007, I traveled to three war zones.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nI traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd over there I experienced\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nother people's suffering, up close and personal,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nimmersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nand at times I experienced great fear for my own life.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAs always, I would return to Bangalore,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nand often to animated discussions at friend's homes,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nwhere we would discuss various issues\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nwhile they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwhere a drink often cost more than what they'd paid\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\ntheir 14-year-old maid.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nI would feel very isolated during these discussions.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nBut at the same time, I questioned myself\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd I decided that I had compromised,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\njust like my friends in those discussions,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nwhere we told stories\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nin contexts we made excuses for,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nrather than taking responsibility for.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nbut let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nother substances and a woman.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nI basically decided that it was I,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nnot the camera or the network,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nor anything that lay outside myself,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat was the only instrument in storytelling\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\ntruly worth tuning.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nIn my life, when I tried to achieve things\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nlike success or recognition, they eluded me.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nParadoxically, when I let go of these objectives,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nand worked from a place of compassion and purpose,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nlooking for excellence, rather than the results of it,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958\neverything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nPhotography transcended culture, including my own.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand gives voice to people and stories without.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nI invite you into three recent stories of mine,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwhich are about this way of looking, if you will,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwhich I believe exemplify the tenets\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nof what I like to call compassion in storytelling.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nIn 2007 I went to Liberia,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwhere a group of my friends and I\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\ndid an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\non a very legendary and brutal war-lord\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nnamed General Butt Naked.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nHis real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhere he once used to torture and murder people,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nincluding children.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nJoshua claims to have personally killed\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nmore than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nHe got his name from fighting stark naked.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd he is probably the most prolific mass murderer\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nalive on Earth today.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThis woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nJoshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand enforced his command with great brutality.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nToday many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand they are destitute, like these young men in the image.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nHow do you live with yourself\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nif you know you've committed horrific crimes?\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nToday the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nAnd he's on a mission.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nvisiting villages where he had once killed and raped.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nHe seeked forgiveness,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand he claims to endeavor to improve\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthe lives of his child-soldiers.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nDuring this expedition I expected him\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nto be killed outright, and us as well.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nBut what I saw opened my eyes\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nto an idea of forgiveness\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nwhich I never thought possible.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nIn the midst of incredible poverty and loss,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\npeople who had nothing absolved a man\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwho had taken everything from them.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nHe begs for forgiveness,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand receives it from the same woman\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwhose brother he murdered.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSenegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwas once a child soldier, under the General's command,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nuntil he disobeyed orders,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand the General shot off both his legs.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nHe forgives the General in this image.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nHe risked his life as he walked up to people\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwhose families he'd murdered.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIn this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd Joshua remains silent\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nas they vented their rage against him.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwith a man, surrounded by various influences,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\ndesperate to hold on to something true within himself,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nin a context of great suffering that he has created himself.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nI was intensely moved during all this.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nBut the question is,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\ndoes forgiveness and redemption replace justice?\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nJoshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nstanding trial for his crimes,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nand speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nto an audience that often includes his victims.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nA very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nseparation of church and state.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThe second story I'm going to tell you about\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nis about a group of very special fighting women\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwith rather unique peace-keeping skills.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nLiberia has been devastated by one of Africa's\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nbloodiest civil wars,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwhich has left more than 200,000 people dead,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthousands of women scarred by rape and crime\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\non a spectacular scale.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nLiberia is now home\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto an all-woman United Nations contingent\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nof Indian peacekeepers.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThese women, many from small towns in India,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhelp keep the peace, far away from home and family.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThey use negotiation and tolerance\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nmore often than an armed response.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe commander told me that a woman could gauge\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\na potentially violent situation\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nmuch better than men.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThis man was very drunk,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand he was very interested in my camera,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nuntil he noticed the women, who handled him\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nwith smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThis contingent seems to be quite lucky,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand it has not sustained any casualties,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\neven though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd yes, all of those people killed were male.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nMany of the women are married with children,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand they say the hardest part of their deployment\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nwas being kept away from their children.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI accompanied these women on their patrols,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand watched as they walked past men,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nmany who passed very lewd comments incessantly.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nshe said, \"Don't worry, same thing back home.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nWe know how to deal with these fellows,\"\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand ignored them.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nIn a country ravaged by violence against women,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nIndian peacekeepers have inspired many local women\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nto join the police force.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe most inspiring stories are the ones\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthat float just beneath the radar.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nI came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd one editor told me that she wasn't interested\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nin doing what she called \"manual labor stories.\"\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nIn 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwhich, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nThey answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd all this against incredible logistical odds,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nlike heat and traffic jams.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSomething amazing happened during this shoot.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nDue to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\na large slum, which had caught fire.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAs we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThese men were terrified,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nas the mob attacked our vehicle.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut nonetheless, despite the hostility,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nfirefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nRunning the gauntlet through hostile crowds,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSome of the local people forcibly took away the hoses\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nfrom the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nNow, hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nBut the question that lingered in my mind was,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nwhat causes people to destroy fire trucks\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nheaded to their own homes?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nWhere does such rage come from?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAnd how are we responsible for this?\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\n45 percent of the 14 million people\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwho live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nwhich are chronically overcrowded.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThey lack even the most basic amenities.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd this is something that is common to all our big cities.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nBack to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nthousands of drums filled with petrochemicals\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nwere blazing away and exploding all around us.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThe heat was so intense, that hoses were used\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nto cool down firefighters\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nfighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nIn India we often love to complain about our government bodies.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nBut over here, the heads of the DFS,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nMr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nled the firefight with their men.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSomething wonderful in a country where\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nmanual labor is often looked down upon.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nOver the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand my own faith in humanity.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nHowever, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nSome of the firemen told me that they were also inspired\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nto do better because they were so pleased\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nto get thank-yous rather than brick bats.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nIt seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nat least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nread magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nSometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nregardless of the context,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\ncan help magnify these intangibles three ways,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nin the protagonist of the story, in the audience,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nand also in the storyteller.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nAnd that's the power of storytelling.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nFocus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand it grows.

In fact, they make their living on this stuff. I'm going to try to save you all the time and money and go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me. Started a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com. It's what you'd call a social news website;basically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web. You find some interesting content \u2014 say, a TED Talk \u2014 submit it to Reddit, and a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't. That creates the front page. It's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day. But this isn't about Reddit. It's about discovering new things that pop up on the web. In the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes, all kinds of trends get born right on our front page.This isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales. Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign. The whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it. One of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales. But to personify the movement, they wanted to name it.So in true web fashion, they put together a poll, where they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names. I believe this is the Farsi word for \"immortal.\" I think this means \"divine power of the ocean\" in a Polynesian language. And then there was this: \"Mister Splashy Pants.\"(Laughter)And this was a special name. Mister Pants, or \"Splashy\" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet. In fact, someone on Reddit thought, \"What a great thing, we should all vote this up.\" And Redditors responded and all agreed. So the voting started. We got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day, from the alien to Splashy, to help the cause. And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying, \"We love Splashy Pants!\"So it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started, to 70 percent at the end of voting. Pretty impressive, right? We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen. Just kidding \u2014 Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it, because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win. They said, \"No, just kidding. We'll give it another week of voting.\"Well, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.(Laughter)And the Reddit community \u2014 really, the rest of the Internet, really got behind this. Facebook groups were created. Facebook applications were created. The idea was, \"Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants.\" People were putting up signs in the real world about this whale.(Laughter)This was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes. To give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three.There was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants. Which is obvious. It's a great name. Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say, \"Mister Splashy Pants.\"(Laughter)I think that's what helped drive this. What was cool were the repercussions. Greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it \u2014 Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins, an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy. But even more important was that they accomplished their mission. The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition. Mission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled, the whales were happy \u2014 that's a quote.(Laughter)And actually, Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers. A few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people, really interested and caught up in this meme. Greenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation. But this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool.This is how the Internet works. This is that great big secret. The Internet provides a level playing field. Your link is as good as your link, which is as good as my link. With a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter your budget. That is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.Another important thing is it costs nothing to get content online. There are so many publishing tools available, it only takes a few minutes to produce something. and the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well.If you do, be genuine. Be honest, up-front. One of the great lessons Greenpeace learned is that it's OK to lose control, OK to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your goal. That's the final message I want to share: you can do well online. But no longer is the message coming from just the top down. If you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 714, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:16.227\nThere are a lot of web 2.0 consultants\nwho make a lot of money.\n\n00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.425\nIn fact, they make\ntheir living on this stuff.\n\n00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.857\nI'm going to try to save you\nall the time and money\n\n00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.739\nand go through it in the next\nthree minutes, so bear with me.\n\n00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:26.933\nStarted a website in 2005\nwith a few friends, called Reddit.com.\n\n00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:28.993\nIt's what you'd call\na social news website;\n\n00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:32.271\nbasically, the democratic front page\nof the best stuff on the web.\n\n00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.157\nYou find some interesting content --\nsay, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,\n\n00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.746\nand a community of your peers votes up\nif they like it, down if they don't.\n\n00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.107\nThat creates the front page.\n\n00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.288\nIt's always rising, falling;\na half million people visit every day.\n\n00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:45.649\nBut this isn't about Reddit.\n\n00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:48.374\nIt's about discovering new things\nthat pop up on the web.\n\n00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:50.942\nIn the last four years,\nwe've seen all kinds of memes,\n\n00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.591\nall kinds of trends get born\nright on our front page.\n\n00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.831\nThis isn't about Reddit itself,\nit's actually about humpback whales.\n\n00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:00.535\nWell, technically, it's about Greenpeace,\nan environmental organization\n\n00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.643\nthat wanted to stop the Japanese\ngovernment's whaling campaign.\n\n00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.736\nThe whales were getting killed;\nthey wanted to put an end to it.\n\n00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.513\nOne of the ways they wanted to do it\n\n00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:11.025\nwas to put a tracking chip\ninside one of the whales.\n\n00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.667\nBut to personify the movement,\nthey wanted to name it.\n\n00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.010\nSo in true web fashion,\nthey put together a poll,\n\n00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:19.458\nwhere they had a bunch of very erudite,\nvery thoughtful, cultured names.\n\n00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:21.736\nI believe this is the Farsi word\nfor \"immortal.\"\n\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.794\nI think this means \"divine power\nof the ocean\" in a Polynesian language.\n\n00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:28.648\nAnd then there was this:\n\"Mister Splashy Pants.\"\n\n00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:29.906\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.295\nAnd this was a special name.\n\n00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.992\nMister Pants, or \"Splashy\" to his friends,\nwas very popular on the Internet.\n\n00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.764\nIn fact, someone on Reddit thought,\n\n00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:39.102\n\"What a great thing,\nwe should all vote this up.\"\n\n00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:41.529\nAnd Redditors responded and all agreed.\n\n00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:42.842\nSo the voting started.\n\n00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.736\nWe got behind it ourselves;\nwe changed our logo for the day,\n\n00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.330\nfrom the alien to Splashy,\nto help the cause.\n\n00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:51.346\nAnd it wasn't long before other sites\nlike Fark and Boing Boing\n\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.647\nand the rest of the Internet started\nsaying, \"We love Splashy Pants!\"\n\n00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:58.316\nSo it went from about five percent,\nwhich was when this meme started,\n\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.934\nto 70 percent at the end of voting.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.344\nPretty impressive, right?\nWe won!

So, that's home really. The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands off the southwest coast of India here. Capital, Mal\u00e9, where I live. Actually, sitting here today in Mysore, we're closer to Mal\u00e9 than we are to Delhi, for example.If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment. But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be. And it has been my home these years. For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs, fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling. I spend as much of my time as possible investigating the marine life. I study fish, also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.This is a blue whale. We have blue whales in the waters around here, off Maldives, around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala. And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region. One of the best places in the world to see blue whales is here in this region. In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka, during the northeast monsoon season, you can see blue whales very, very easily. It's probably the best place in the world to see them.Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season, I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean, but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure. I need to explain a little bit about monsoons. Now, monsoon, the root of the word \"monsoon\" comes from the word \"season.\"So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia. And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot. Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it. And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest. It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India. So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon. Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean. That's what brings the monsoon rain. And then in the winter things cool down. High pressure builds over India. And the whole system goes into reverse.So, the wind is now coming from the northeast out of India, across the Indian Ocean, this way towards Africa. Keep that in mind. Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose. I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves, including dragonflies. And I'm actually going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies. This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.And one thing you need to know about dragonflies, one important thing, is that they lay their eggs in fresh water. They need fresh water to breed. They lay the eggs into fresh water. Little larvae hatch out in fresh water. They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae. So, they're very important. They control mosquito larvae, among other things. And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see. And typically, there is a lot of variation, but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle, which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water, lives for 10 or 11 months. And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months. So it's essentially a freshwater animal. It really does need fresh water.Now, the particular species of dragonfly I want to talk about is this one, because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen, when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life, it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far. A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical. They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far. But this guy is an exception. And this is called the Globe Skimmer, or Wandering Glider. And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world. It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific. And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it. But it really hasn't been studied very much.It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly. If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones, like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones. This is, it seems a bit dull you know. It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common. And it occurs everywhere \u2014 you know, why bother? But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special. Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell. And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it living in the Maldives.When I first went to the Maldives, dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time as I could in and under the water. Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't. Didn't notice them. But after some time, after some months, one day as I was going out and about, suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies. Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer. I didn't know at the time, but I know now, they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them. And they were there for some time. And then they were gone.And I didn't think anything more of it until the following year, when it happened again, and then the year after that, and then the year after that. And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice. But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year. And I asked people about them and yes, they knew, but they didn't know anything, where they came from, or anything. And again I didn't think too much of it. But slowly it began to dawn on me that something rather special was happening.Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed. And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there \u2014 so here is home. So, Maldives, beautiful place. (Laughter) It's built entirely of coral reefs. And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks. Average height, about that much above sea level. So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue. But I'm not going to talk about that. Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone. So, it stays under the soil. The trees can put their roots into it. Humans can dig holes and make a well.But dragonflies \u2014 a bit tricky. There is no surface fresh water. There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes, nothing like that. So, why is it that every year millions of dragonflies, millions, millions of dragonflies turn up? I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here, because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who, from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here. Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here, let me have a show of hands, who of you \u2014 not yet, not yet! You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on. Wait for the go. I'll say go.Those of you who grew up in India, do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies, swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school, maybe tying little bits of string onto them? Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that. You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies. Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's a widespread phenomenon throughout South Asia, including the Maldives. And I got a bit curious about it.In the Maldives \u2014 now, in India there is plenty of water, so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not? But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on? And the first thing I did was started recording when they turned up in the Maldives. And there is the answer, 21st of October. Not every year, that's the average date. So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now. You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place. But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon, Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon. But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west. It's going towards India, not from India. So, are these things, how are these things getting here? Are they coming from India against the wind? Seemed a bit unlikely.So, next thing I did is I got on the phone. Maldives is a long archipelago. It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here. I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues. When do you see the dragonflies appear? And pretty soon, a picture started emerging. In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me information for three years, average, 24th of September, so late September. Down in Trivandrum, a bit later. Far north of Maldives, a bit later. Then Mal\u00e9, then further south. And then the southernmost Maldives. It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India. But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind. How on Earth are they doing that? I didn't know.The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies. I wanted to know about their seasonality, what time of year, this is when they first arrive, but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues? So, I started a very rigorous scientific process. I had a rigorous scientific transect. I got on my bicycle, and I cycled around the island of Mal\u00e9. It's about five kilometers around, counting the dragonflies as I go, trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.And they're here for a very short time, October, November, December. That's it. And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it. October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season. That's not the southwest season. That's the inter-monsoon, the time when the monsoon changes.Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way, and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way. And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that. What happens, actually, is there is two air masses. And there is a front between them, and the front moves. So, if you've got India here, when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon. Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon. And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle.So, as it comes over towards Mal\u00e9 I'm standing in Mal\u00e9 underneath the front. I can be in the southwest monsoon. But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon. So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon, but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible. These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India], two inches long, five centimeters long, flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean, at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one, I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit, and that's okay, I know how they come here, but why do they come here? What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year to their apparent doom? It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives. What on Earth are they doing? Well, to cut a long story short, they're actually flying right across the ocean. They're making it all the way across to East Africa.I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean. I know because we have reports from Seychelles, which fit in as well, down here. And I know because when you look at the rainfall, these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools. Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are, the monsoon rains. The larvae have to develop very quickly. They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks. They're up, and they're off.Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back, the top is rainfall for India. And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain. By September, October, it's drying out. Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain. They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain. And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala. And then they run out of land. But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species, it can fly for thousands of kilometers. And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa, where it's raining. And they are breeding in the rains of Africa. Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here. And the dragonflies you can see today outside here, on the campus, are the young of this generation. They hatched out in India. They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed. But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop, perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa. The wind will swoosh them out across here. If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look, nothing there, they'll carry on.Here, here, Kenya, East Africa, they've actually just come out of a long drought. Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke and it's raining there now. And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts. The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there. When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now. They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here. They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is the wind is always converging to where the rain is. The rain occurs, these are summer rains. This is a summer monsoon. The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa. The sun is overhead, maximum heating, maximum evaporation, maximum clouds, maximum rainfall, maximum opportunities for reproduction.Not only that, because you have this convection, you have this rising of the air where it's hot, air is drawn in. There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling, the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising. So, the little fellow that hatches out here, he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried to where the rain is falling. Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up, automatically carried to where the rain is falling. It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back. So, in four generations, one, two, three, four and then back.A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean. This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers. 16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you, for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible. Those of you from North America will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly. Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration. It's only half the length of this one. And this crossing here, of the ocean, is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect. A quite incredible feat. And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal\u00e9, in Maldives for long enough for it to percolate into my brain that something rather special was going on.But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing. There is more to the story. I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar with this fellow. This is a rather special bird. It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously. But it's also called the Amur Falcon. And it's called the Amur Falcon because it breeds in Amurland. Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here. It's the border, much of it is the border between China and Russia, up here in the far east.So, Siberia, Manchuria. And that's where it breeds. And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer. But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter. It's, well, you can imagine. So, as any sensible bird would do, he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south. But then the being sensible stopped. So, now they don't stop here, or even down here. No, they turn across here. They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India. They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa. And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya. And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa]. Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.And they are not the only one that makes the crossing. They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby. This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo. Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this. It comes with the monsoons. This time of year they cross back to Africa. And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird. It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest, so it's known as the Kashmir Roller. And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records, all the available records of these birds, put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time as the dragonflies. They make use of exactly the same winds. They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately, one of these met an unfortunate end. He was flying off the coast of Goa, 21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988. An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa, bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out. Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters. Same height as the dragonflies go. So, they are using the same winds. And the other thing, the other important factor for all these birds, all medium sized fellows, and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater. Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek. It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater. And every one of these birds that makes the crossing from India to East Africa eats insects, large insects, the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.

We have blue whales\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nin the waters around here, off Maldives,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\naround the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nOne of the best places in the world to see blue whales\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis here in this region.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIn Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nduring the northeast monsoon season,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nyou can see blue whales very, very easily.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIt's probably the best place in the world to see them.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nNow, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nbut perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nI need to explain a little bit about monsoons.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nNow, monsoon, the root of the word \"monsoon\"\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\ncomes from the word \"season.\"\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nHot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nIt comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nSo it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nPicks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nThat's what brings the monsoon rain.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nAnd then in the winter things cool down.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nHigh pressure builds over India.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nAnd the whole system goes into reverse.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo, the wind is now coming from the northeast\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nout of India, across the Indian Ocean,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthis way towards Africa.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nKeep that in mind.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nNow, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\na bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nincluding dragonflies. And I'm actually\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\ngoing to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThis is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd one thing you need to know about dragonflies,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\none important thing,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nis that they lay their eggs in fresh water.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nThey need fresh water to breed.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThey lay the eggs into fresh water.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nLittle larvae hatch out in fresh water.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThey feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nSo, they're very important.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nThey control mosquito larvae, among other things.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nAnd they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nof the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd typically, there is a lot of variation,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhich is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nlives for 10 or 11 months.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo it's essentially a freshwater animal.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nIt really does need fresh water.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nNow, the particular species of dragonfly\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI want to talk about is this one,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nbecause most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nwhen the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nit doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nA few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThey are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nBut this guy is an exception.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd this is called the Globe Skimmer,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nor Wandering Glider.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nIt lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAfrica, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut it really hasn't been studied very much.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIt's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIf you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nlike that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nThis is, it seems a bit dull you know.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nBecause this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nliving in the Maldives.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWhen I first went to the Maldives,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\ndead keen on diving, spent as much of my time\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nas I could in and under the water.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nDidn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nDidn't notice them.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nBut after some time, after some months, one day\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nas I was going out and about,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nsuddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSomething like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI didn't know at the time, but I know now,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthey're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd they were there for some time. And then they were gone.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd I didn't think anything more of it until\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nthe following year, when it happened again,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand then the year after that, and then the year after that.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd I asked people about them and yes,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthey knew, but they didn't know anything,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nwhere they came from, or anything.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd again I didn't think too much of it.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nBut slowly it began to dawn on me that something\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nrather special was happening.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nBecause dragonflies need fresh water to breed.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nso here is home.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nSo, Maldives, beautiful place.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIt's built entirely of coral reefs.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nAnd on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAverage height, about that much above sea level.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nBut I'm not going to talk about that.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnother important point of these sand banks\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nis that when it rains,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nthe rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo, it stays under the soil.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe trees can put their roots into it.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nHumans can dig holes and make a well.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut dragonflies -- a bit tricky.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThere is no surface fresh water.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThere are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nnothing like that.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nSo, why is it that every year\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nmillions of dragonflies, millions,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nmillions of dragonflies turn up?\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nI got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nbecause I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nfrom India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThose of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nlet me have a show of hands, who of you --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nnot yet, not yet!\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nYou're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nWait for the go. I'll say go.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nThose of you who grew up in India,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ndo you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nswarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nmaybe tying little bits of string onto them?\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nMaybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nYou've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAny hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIt's a widespread phenomenon\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthroughout South Asia, including the Maldives.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd I got a bit curious about it.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nIn the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nso, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nBut in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd the first thing I did was started recording\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwhen they turned up in the Maldives.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd there is the answer, 21st of October.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nNot every year, that's the average date.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nBut in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nMaldives is still in the southwest monsoon.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nBut wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nIt's going towards India, not from India.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nSo, are these things, how are these things getting here?\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAre they coming from India against the wind?\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSeemed a bit unlikely.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nSo, next thing I did is I got on the phone.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nMaldives is a long archipelago.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIt stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWhen do you see the dragonflies appear?\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd pretty soon, a picture started emerging.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nIn Bangalore, a colleague there sent me\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\ninformation for three years, average,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\n24th of September, so late September.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nDown in Trivandrum, a bit later.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nFar north of Maldives, a bit later.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThen Mal\u00e9, then further south.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd then the southernmost Maldives.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nIt's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nBut they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nHow on Earth are they doing that?\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI didn't know.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThe next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nI wanted to know about their seasonality,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nwhat time of year, this is when they first arrive,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nbut how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo, I started a very rigorous scientific process.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nI had a rigorous scientific transect.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI got on my bicycle,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand I cycled around the island of Mal\u00e9.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nIt's about five kilometers around,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\ncounting the dragonflies as I go,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\ntrying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd they're here for a very short time,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nOctober, November, December. That's it.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nAnd then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nOctober, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThat's not the southwest season.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThat's the inter-monsoon,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe time when the monsoon changes.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nNow, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nand then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nAnd that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\ngoing up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWhat happens, actually, is there is two air masses.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd there is a front between them, and the front moves.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, if you've got India here,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nwhen the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThen the front moves into the northeast monsoon.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd that front in the middle is not vertical,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nit's at an angle.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nSo, as it comes over towards Mal\u00e9\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nI'm standing in Mal\u00e9 underneath the front.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI can be in the southwest monsoon.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nBut the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSo, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nbut at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThese little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\ntwo inches long, five centimeters long,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nflying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nat 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nI know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand that's okay,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nI know how they come here, but why do they come here?\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWhat are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto their apparent doom?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nIt doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nWhat on Earth are they doing?\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nWell, to cut a long story short,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nthey're actually flying right across the ocean.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThey're making it all the way across to East Africa.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nI know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwho have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI know because we have reports from Seychelles,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nwhich fit in as well, down here.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd I know because\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhen you look at the rainfall,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthese particular insects, these Globe Skimmers\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nbreed in temporary rain water pools.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nOkay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthe monsoon rains.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe larvae have to develop very quickly.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThey only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThey're up, and they're off.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nNow, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe top is rainfall for India.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nBy September, October, it's drying out.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nNothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThey've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthey come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd then they run out of land.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nBut they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nit can fly for thousands of kilometers.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nAnd it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nswooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nwhere it's raining.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd they are breeding in the rains of Africa.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nNow, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\ntwo breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhat's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the dragonflies you can see today\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\noutside here, on the campus,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nare the young of this generation.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThey hatched out in India.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThey're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nBut most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nperhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nThe wind will swoosh them out across here.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nIf they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nnothing there, they'll carry on.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nHere, here, Kenya, East Africa,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthey've actually just come out of a long drought.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nJust last week the rains broke. The short rains broke\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand it's raining there now.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThe dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWhen those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThey'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nthe seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThey'll fly down here. And the clever thing is\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthe wind is always converging to where the rain is.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThe rain occurs, these are summer rains.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nThis is a summer monsoon.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nThe sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nThe sun is overhead, maximum heating,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nmaximum evaporation, maximum clouds,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nmaximum rainfall,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nmaximum opportunities for reproduction.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nNot only that, because you have this convection,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nyou have this rising of the air\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nwhere it's hot, air is drawn in.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThere's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nthe air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo, the little fellow that hatches out here,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nhe gets up into the air, he is automatically carried\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto where the rain is falling.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nLay their eggs, next generation, they come up,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nautomatically carried to where the rain is falling.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nIt's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nSo, in four generations, one, two, three,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nfour and then back.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nA complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThis is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nfor a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThose of you from North America\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwill be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nWhich, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nIt's only half the length of this one.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd this crossing here, of the ocean,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nis the only truly regular transoceanic crossing\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nof any insect.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nA quite incredible feat.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nAnd I only stumbled on this because I was living in Mal\u00e9,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nin Maldives for long enough\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nfor it to percolate into my brain\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat something rather special was going on.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nBut dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThere is more to the story.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nI'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nwith this fellow. This is a rather special bird.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nIt's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBut it's also called the Amur Falcon.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nAnd it's called the Amur Falcon\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nbecause it breeds in Amurland.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nWhich is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIt's the border, much of it is the border\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nbetween China and Russia, up here in the far east.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nSo, Siberia, Manchuria.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAnd that's where it breeds.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt's, well, you can imagine.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nSo, as any sensible bird would do,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nhe moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nBut then the being sensible stopped.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nSo, now they don't stop here, or even down here.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nNo, they turn across here.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThey have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThey come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nAnd then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIncredible. This is the most extraordinary migration\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nof any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd they are not the only one that makes the crossing.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nThey have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nto Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nThis fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThose of you from northern India will be familiar with this.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt comes with the monsoons.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThis time of year they cross back to Africa.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nIt's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nso it's known as the Kashmir Roller.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nall the available records of these birds,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nput them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nas the dragonflies.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThey make use of exactly the same winds.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nThey travel at exactly the same time with the same winds\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nto make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nIt's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\none of these met an unfortunate end.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nHe was flying off the coast of Goa,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\n21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nAn Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\ngot back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nFlying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nSame height as the dragonflies go.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo, they are using the same winds.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd the other thing, the other important factor\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nfor all these birds, all medium sized fellows,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nand this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nBee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nIt's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd every one of these birds that makes the crossing\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nfrom India to East Africa\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.958\neats insects, large insects,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nthe size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Metaphorically speaking", "duration": "570", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_geary_metaphorically_speaking", "transcript": "Metaphor lives a secret life all around us. We utter about six metaphors a minute. Metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others, how we communicate, learn, discover and invent. But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.Now, to assist me in explaining this, I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers, the reigning king of the metaphorians, a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself has become a metaphor. I am, of course, referring to none other than Elvis Presley. (Laughter)Now, \"All Shook Up\" is a great love song. It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract \u2014 ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts \u2014 we inevitably resort to metaphor. In \"All Shook Up,\" a touch is not a touch, but a chill. Lips are not lips, but volcanoes. She is not she, but a buttercup. And love is not love, but being all shook up.In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else. This is the mathematics of metaphor. And fortunately it's very simple. X equals Y. (Laughter) This formula works wherever metaphor is present.Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare in this famous line from \"Romeo and Juliet:\" Juliet is the sun. Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet, a name that belongs to something else, the sun. But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else, we give it a whole network of analogies too. We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source, in this case the sun, with what we know about its target, Juliet. And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.So, how do we make and understand metaphors? This might look familiar. The first step is pattern recognition. Look at this image. What do you see? Three wayward Pac-Men, and three pointy brackets are actually present. What we see, however, are two overlapping triangles. Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns; it is the creation of patterns. Second step, conceptual synesthesia.Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well, such as colored hearing. People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters. We all have synesthetic abilities. This is the Bouba/Kiki test. What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki. (Laughter)If you are like 98 percent of other people, you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba, and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki. Can we do a quick show of hands? Does that correspond? Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it. Why do we do that? Because we instinctively find, or create, a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of Bouba, and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic. Silence is sweet. Neckties are loud. Sexually attractive people are hot. Sexually unattractive people leave us cold. Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia, in which we understand one concept in the context of another.Third step is cognitive dissonance. This is the Stroop test. What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed. You can take the test now. If you're like most people, you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink. The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well. The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible, the literally false sentences. They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences. Why? Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either.One of the sentences was, \"Some jobs are jails.\" Now, unless you're a prison guard, the sentence \"Some jobs are jails\" is literally false. Sadly, it's metaphorically true. And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false. Metaphor matters because it's around us every day, all the time. Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news. Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing, as in, \"The NASDAQ climbed higher.\" Object metaphors describe price movements as non-living things, as in, \"The Dow fell like a brick.\"Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries, and then predict the next day's price trend. Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that price trends would continue. And they had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal. If, for example, house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing, higher and higher, people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable. They may feel confident, say, in taking out mortgages they really can't afford. That's a hypothetical example of course. But this is how metaphor misleads.Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies. A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help. And they had to make a decision. What should they do? Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing? They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis. Each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy: World War II, Vietnam, and the third was historically neutral.Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others. Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words, we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor. Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery. Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery, we compare what we know with what we don't know. And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play. He famously used thought experiments, which are essentially elaborate analogies, to come up with some of his greatest discoveries. By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy, metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery.Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden. But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it. Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as \"fossil poetry.\" But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor. And these fossils still breathe.Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy: \"Cogito ergo sum.\" That's routinely translated as, \"I think, therefore I am.\" But there is a better translation. The Latin word \"cogito\" is derived from the prefix \"co,\" meaning \"together,\" and the verb \"agitare,\" meaning \"to shake.\" So, the original meaning of \"cogito\" is to shake together. And the proper translation of \"cogito ergo sum\" is \"I shake things up, therefore I am.\" (Laughter)Metaphor shakes things up, giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process. The mind is a plastic snow dome, the most beautiful, most interesting, and most itself, when, as Elvis put it, it's all shook up. And metaphor keeps the mind shaking, rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building. Thank you very much.

What do you see?\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThree wayward Pac-Men,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nand three pointy brackets are actually present.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nWhat we see, however,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare two overlapping triangles.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nMetaphor is not just the detection of patterns;\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nit is the creation of patterns.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSecond step, conceptual synesthesia.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nNow, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nin another sense organ as well,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nsuch as colored hearing.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nPeople with colored hearing\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nactually see colors when they hear the sounds\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nof words or letters.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nWe all have synesthetic abilities.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nThis is the Bouba/Kiki test.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWhat you have to do is identify which of these shapes\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nis called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nIf you are like 98 percent of other people,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nyou will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nCan we do a quick show of hands?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nDoes that correspond?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nOkay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nWhy do we do that?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nBecause we instinctively find, or create,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\na pattern between the round shape\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand the round sound of Bouba,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSilence is sweet.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nNeckties are loud.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSexually attractive people are hot.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nSexually unattractive people leave us cold.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nMetaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nin which we understand one concept\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nin the context of another.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThird step is cognitive dissonance.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThis is the Stroop test.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWhat you need to do here is identify\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nas quickly as possible\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthe color of the ink in which these words are printed.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nYou can take the test now.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nIf you're like most people, you will experience\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\na moment of cognitive dissonance\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nwhen the name of the color\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nis printed in a differently colored ink.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThe test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\neven when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nStroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThe participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nthe literally false sentences.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThey took longer to reject metaphors as false\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthan they did to reject literally false sentences.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nWhy? Because we cannot ignore\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nthe metaphorical meaning of words either.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nOne of the sentences was, \"Some jobs are jails.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nNow, unless you're a prison guard,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nthe sentence \"Some jobs are jails\" is literally false.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSadly, it's metaphorically true.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nto identify it as literally false.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nMetaphor matters because\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nit's around us every day, all the time.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nMetaphor matters because it creates expectations.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nPay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAgent metaphors describe price movements\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nas the deliberate action of a living thing,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nas in, \"The NASDAQ climbed higher.\"\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nObject metaphors describe price movements\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nas non-living things,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nas in, \"The Dow fell like a brick.\"\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nResearchers asked a group of people\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nto read a clutch of market commentaries,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand then predict the next day's price trend.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThose exposed to agent metaphors\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nhad higher expectations that price trends would continue.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd they had those expectations because\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nagent metaphors imply the deliberate action\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nof a living thing pursuing a goal.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nIf, for example, house prices\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nare routinely described as climbing and climbing,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nhigher and higher, people might naturally assume\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthat that rise is unstoppable.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThey may feel confident, say,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nin taking out mortgages they really can't afford.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nThat's a hypothetical example of course.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nBut this is how metaphor misleads.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nMetaphor also matters because it influences decisions\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nby activating analogies.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nA group of students was told that a small democratic country\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nhad been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd they had to make a decision.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWhat should they do?\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIntervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThey were each then given one of three\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\ndescriptions of this hypothetical crisis.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nEach of which was designed to trigger\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\na different historical analogy:\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWorld War II, Vietnam,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand the third was historically neutral.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThose exposed to the World War II scenario\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nmade more interventionist recommendations\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthan the others.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nJust as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nwe cannot ignore the analogies\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat are triggered by metaphor.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nMetaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nWhenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwe compare what we know with what we don't know.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd the only way to find out about the latter\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nis to investigate the ways it might be like the former.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nEinstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nHe famously used thought experiments,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwhich are essentially elaborate analogies,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nto come up with some of his greatest discoveries.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nBy bringing together what we know\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand what we don't know through analogy,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nmetaphorical thinking strikes the spark\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat ignites discovery.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nNow metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBut you just have to look at the words around you\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand you'll find it.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nRalph Waldo Emerson described language\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nas \"fossil poetry.\"\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBut before it was fossil poetry\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nlanguage was fossil metaphor.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnd these fossils still breathe.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nTake the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\n\"Cogito ergo sum.\"\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThat's routinely translated as, \"I think, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut there is a better translation.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe Latin word \"cogito\"\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nis derived from the prefix \"co,\" meaning \"together,\"\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand the verb \"agitare,\" meaning \"to shake.\"\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo, the original meaning of \"cogito\"\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nis to shake together.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nAnd the proper translation of \"cogito ergo sum\"\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nis \"I shake things up, therefore I am.\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nMetaphor shakes things up,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:01.958\ngiving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThe mind is a plastic snow dome,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthe most beautiful, most interesting,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand most itself, when, as Elvis put it,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nit's all shook up.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd metaphor keeps the mind shaking,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nrattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A new way to fight corruption", "duration": "641", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shaffi_mather_a_new_way_to_fight_corruption",

My experiences over the last 18 months, as a lawyer, has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea, which I believe is indeed worth spreading. So, I share it with all of you here today, though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan. Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases.I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since 1993. I've explored, experienced, and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart's content. I built, along with my two brothers, the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala, and then worked professionally with two of India's biggest businessmen, but in their startup enterprises. In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so-called social sector issues, I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for-profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues.When life brought about a series of death and near-death experiences within my close circle, which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India, similar to 911 in USA. To address this, I, along with four friends, founded Ambulance Access for All, to promote life-support ambulance services in India. For those from the developing world, there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea. But as we envisioned it, we had three key goals: Providing world-class life support ambulance service which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams, and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency, irrespective of the capability to pay. The service which grew out of this, Dial 1298 for Ambulance, with one ambulance in 2004, now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states, and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception.The service is \u2014 (Applause) fully self-sustainable from its own revenues, without accessing any public funds, and the cross-subsidy model actually works, where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower, and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge. The service responded effectively and efficiently, during the unfortunate 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. And as you can see from the visuals, the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike. We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims, saving life.(Applause)In tribute and remembrance of 26/11 attacks over the last one year, we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO, Aman Foundation, to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.(Applause)It's a small message from us, in our own small way to the enemies of humanity, of Islam, of South Asia, of India, and of Pakistan, that humanity will continue to bloom, irrespective of such dastardly attacks. Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises. One is Education Access for All, setting up schools in small-town India. And the other is Moksha-Yug Access, which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance. I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right. Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding. With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I'm exploring. Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency. You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks. Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side, with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man. And the demand side being mostly politicians, bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them.According to World Bank estimate, one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year, worsening the condition of the already worse off. Yet, if you analyze the common man, he or she does not wake up every day and say, \"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today.\" or, \"Let me see who I can corrupt today.\" Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe. In the modern day world, where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough, the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.Now, let me ask you another question. Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day-to-day life to get something done. What do you do? Of course you can call the police. But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption? Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe. But you also don't have the time, resources, expertise or wherewithal to fight this. Unfortunately, many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in, pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe. Like a bribe buster service, or 1-800-Fight-Bribes, or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org. Such a service simply do not exist. One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office. All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house, from ground level, making it easier for her to enter and exit her house. Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe. Even though it pricked my conscience then, I could not, or rather I did not tend to her or assist her, because I was busy building my real estate company. I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement. And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act, video, audio, or peer pressure, we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe. And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded. I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment, and made available on web, call-center and franchise physical offices, for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe. The target market is as tempting as it can get. It can be worth up to one trillion dollars, being paid in bribes every year, or equal to India's GDP. And it is an absolutely virgin market.I propose to explore this idea further, to examine the potential of creating a for-profit, fee-based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption. I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy. It never has been and it never will be. In my last 18 months as a lawyer, battling small- and large-scale corruption, including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster. Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation. The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves, our families, our friends, and even our kids. Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.What gives us the courage? As my close friend replied, when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs, I quote: \"Of course we cannot fail in this, at least in our own minds. For we are insane people, trying to do an impossible task. And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is.\" Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea. Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.(Laughter)CA: What's on your mind? I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here \u2014 a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example. Somebody who had applied for the passport. The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes. And he did not want to pay. So we actually used the Right to Information Act, which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States, and pushed back the officers in this particular case. And in all these 42 cases, when we kept pushing them back, there was three kinds of reaction. A set of people actually say, \"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it.\" Some people actually come back and say, \"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do.\" And he will push us back. So you take the next step, or use the next tool available in what we are putting together, and then he relents. By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe, what fee would you have to charge, and can you actually make the business work?SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees. So, it actually works.CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.(Laughter)SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee. If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero. I mean, this could be huge. Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.(Applause)", "id": 717, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nThe anger in me against

me\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nfrom my early business days\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nis of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nby the bureaucrats in the town planning office.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAll she needed was permission to build three steps\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nto her house, from ground level,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nmaking it easier for her to enter and exit her house.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nYet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nfor want of a bribe.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nEven though it pricked my conscience then,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nI could not, or rather I did not\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ntend to her or assist her,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nbecause I was busy building my real estate company.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nI don't want to be haunted by such images any more.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nA group of us have been working on a pilot basis\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nto address individual instances of demands\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nfor bribes for common services or entitlement.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nusing existing and legitimate tools\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nlike the Right to Information Act,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nvideo, audio, or peer pressure,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwe have successfully obtained whatever our clients\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nset out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd with the cost of these tools being substantially lower\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthan the bribe demanded.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nI believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ncan be consolidated in standard processes\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nin a BPO kind of environment,\n\n00:08:38.958 -->

00:09:05.958\nI propose to explore this idea further,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nto examine the potential of creating\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\na for-profit, fee-based

justice\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nagainst corruption is never easy.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nIt never has been and it never will be.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nIn my last 18

We've known about fusion since 1920, when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington and the British Association for the Advancement of Science conjectured that that's why the sun shines.I've always been very worried about resource. I don't know about you, but when my mother gave me food, I always sorted the ones I disliked from the ones I liked. And I ate the disliked ones first, because the ones you like, you want to save. And as a child you're always worried about resource. And once it was sort of explained to me how fast we were using up the world's resources, I got very upset, about as upset as I did when I realized that the Earth will only last about five billion years before it's swallowed by the sun. Big events in my life, a strange child. (Laughter)Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource. The countries that make a lot of money out of energy have something underneath them. Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country \u2014 oil, gas, sorry. (Laughter) Gas, I'm probably the only person who really enjoys it when Mister Putin turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.We're really dominated now by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster. And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty in the Third World, in the developing world, we're using energy faster and faster. And those resources are going away. And the way we'll make energy in the future is not from resource, it's really from knowledge. If you look 50 years into the future, the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three, with some wind, with some other things, but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar. But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world. Fission. Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations. They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations, and probably more after that. China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is. Because they know that that is one sure way to do carbon-free energy.But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is, the perfect energy source is one that doesn't take up much space, has a virtually inexhaustible supply, is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere, doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste: it's fusion. But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases. Fusion is very hard to do. We've been trying for 50 years.Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics. And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on. (Laughter) I was a strange child. Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason. The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table. It's a medium-sized nucleus. And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy. So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split. But small atoms want to join together, small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron.And you can get energy out this way. And indeed that's exactly what stars do. In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon, to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of are made in the middle of stars. But it's a hard process to do because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot, almost by definition. And there is one reaction that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do. It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen: deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen, which you can get from seawater, and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged. And you push them together and they repel. But when you get them close enough, something called the strong force starts to act and pulls them together. So, most of the time they repel. You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together. For a moment they become helium 5, because they've got five particles inside them.So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together makes helium 5. Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out. If you can get something to about 150 million degrees, things will be rattling around so fast that every time they collide in just the right configuration, this will happen, and it will release energy. And that energy is what powers fusion. And it's this reaction that we want to do.There is one trickiness about this reaction. Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet. It's pretty hot. The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature. You have to make it from something else. And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom, that's lithium 6, plus a neutron, will give you more helium, plus tritium. And that's the way you make your tritium. But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction, you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.Now, why the hell would we bother to do this? This is basically why we would bother to do it. If you just plot how much fuel we've got left, in units of present world consumption. And as you go across there you see a few tens of years of oil \u2014 the blue line, by the way, is the lowest estimate of existing resources. And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.And as you go across there you will see that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years of fossil fuels left. And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it, because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air. And then we get to uranium. And with current reactor technology we really don't have very much uranium. And we will have to extract uranium from sea water, which is the yellow line, to make conventional nuclear power stations actually do very much for us. This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto, and do all those kind of things.To go any further you would have to have breeder technology. And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous. The big thing, on the right, is the lithium we have in the world. And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line. And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water. Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion. Is it cost-competitive? We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant. And we get within about the same price as current electricity.So, how would we make it? We have to hold something at 150 million degrees. And, in fact, we've done this. We hold it with a magnetic field. And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape, right in the middle is 150 million degrees. It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees. And in fact we can make fusion happen. And just down the road, this is JET. It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be, I say, \"Yeah, but we've actually done it.\" Right? We can do fusion. In the center of this device we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997. And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again and break all those records. But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen. We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor. Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth. This is the device we're building now.It gets very expensive to do this research. It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right? You can't. You have to do it in a very big device. More than half the world's population is involved in building this device in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment. Seven nations are involved in building this. It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power. But that's not electricity yet. We have to get to this. We have to get to a power plant. We have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology. And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is. But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.I wish this were different. We really need it now. We're going to have a problem with power in the next five years in this country. So 2030 looks like an infinity away. But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward, get fusion to happen. I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources. But this is what we're aiming at, sometime in the 2030s \u2014 real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.

What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI was a strange child.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nNuclear energy comes for a simple reason.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThe most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nIt's a medium-sized nucleus.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nBut small atoms want to join together,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nsmall nuclei want to join together\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nto make bigger ones to go towards iron.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd you can get energy out this way.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd indeed that's exactly what stars do.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand then helium together to make carbon,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nto make oxygen, all the things that you're made of\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nare made in the middle of stars.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nBut it's a hard process to do\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nbecause, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nalmost by definition.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd there is one reaction\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\ndeuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwhich you can get from seawater,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThese two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd you push them together and they repel.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut when you get them close enough,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsomething called the strong force starts to act\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand pulls them together.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo, most of the time they repel.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nYou get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthe strong force grips them together.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nFor a moment they become helium 5,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nbecause they've got five particles inside them.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nSo, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nmakes helium 5.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nHelium splits out, and a neutron comes out\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand lots of energy comes out.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nIf you can get something to about 150 million degrees,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthings will be rattling around so fast\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nthat every time they collide in just the right configuration,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthis will happen, and it will release energy.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd that energy is what powers fusion.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd it's this reaction that we want to do.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThere is one trickiness about this reaction.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWell, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbut there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nIt's pretty hot.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThe trickiness about the reaction is that\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\ntritium doesn't exist in nature.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nYou have to make it from something else.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nthat's lithium 6, plus a neutron,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nwill give you more helium, plus tritium.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd that's the way you make your tritium.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nyou've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nNow, why the hell would we bother to do this?\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis is basically why we would bother to do it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nIf you just plot how much fuel\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nwe've got left, in units of\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\npresent world consumption.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd as you go across there you see\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\na few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nis the lowest estimate of existing resources.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd as you go across there you will see\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nthat we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nof fossil fuels left.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nbecause it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd then we get to uranium.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd with current reactor technology\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nwe really don't have very much uranium.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd we will have to extract uranium from sea water,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhich is the yellow line,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nto make conventional nuclear power stations\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nactually do very much for us.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThis is a bit shocking, because in fact our government\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nis relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand do all those kind of things.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nTo go any further you would have to have breeder technology.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nThe big thing, on the right,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nis the lithium we have in the world.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nEverybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIs it cost-competitive?\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nWe make estimates of what we think it would cost\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nto actually make a fusion power plant.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd we get within about the same price\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nas current electricity.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nSo, how would we make it?\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nWe have to hold something at 150 million degrees.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd, in fact, we've done this.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nWe hold it with a magnetic field.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nright in the middle is 150 million degrees.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIt boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd in fact we can make fusion happen.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd just down the road, this is JET.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nWhen people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nI say, \"Yeah, but we've actually done it.\" Right?\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe can do fusion. In the center of this device\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwe made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd in 2013 we're going to fire it up again\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand break all those records.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nBut that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWe've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nBecause we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThis is the device we're building now.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nIt gets very expensive to do this research.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nIt turns out you can't do fusion on a table top\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\ndespite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nYou can't. You have to do it in a very big device.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nMore than half the world's population is involved in building this device\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nin southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSeven nations are involved in building this.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nBut that's not electricity yet.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nWe have to get to this.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe have to get to a power plant.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nWe have to start putting electricity on the grid\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nin this very complex technology.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI wish this were different. We really need it now.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nWe're going to have a problem with power\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nin the next five years in this country.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo 2030 looks like an infinity away.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nBut we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nget fusion to happen.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nI wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nBut this is what we're aiming at,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nsometime in the 2030s --\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nreal electric power from fusion.

Salaam. Shalom. Sat Sri Akal. Greetings to all of you from Pakistan. It is often said that we fear that which we do not know. And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar. Because it has provoked, and does provoke, a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul, especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil. But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.And what follows is a stream of images, a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's most dynamic and young photographers, that aims to give you an alternative glimpse, a look inside the hearts and minds of some ordinary Pakistani citizens. Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar. I hope that you will be able to see not just my Taliban-like beard, but also the richness and color of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams, as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim. I hope to become a vet when I grow up so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives through technicolored glass. Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles with the pink polka dots?My name is Zamin. And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person, from Swat. Do you see me on the other side of this fence? Do I matter, or really exist for you?My name is Iman. I am a fashion model, an up-and-coming model from Lahore. Do you see me simply smothered in cloth? Or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who I truly am inside?My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee from the Khyber agency. I have come from a place of intense darkness. And that is why I want to illuminate the world.My name is Papusay. My heart and drum beat as one. If religion is the opium of the masses, then for me, music is my one and only ganja.A rising tide lifts all boats. And the rising tide of India's spectacular economic growth has lifted over 400 million Indians into a buoyant middle class. But there are still over 650 million Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese, who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I, it behooves us to transcend our differences, to celebrate our diversity, to leverage our common humanity. Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan, which for many of you, as you all recognize, means \"new life\" in Urdu and Hindi, is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care. Indeed it is the emerging world's first HMO for the urban working poor.Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis? We are but two threads cut from the same cloth. And if our fates are intertwined, then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune. And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here. That was fantastic. I found that really moving. You know, we fought hard to get at least a small Pakistani contingent to come. It felt like it was really important. They went through a lot to get here. Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please? I just really wanted to acknowledge you.

When I took this picture, the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night. And on the other side there was a rising sun. So, you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown, you have the non-obvious, you have the non-seen, for the people who don't dare to go through the ice.There are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side. And I think that's one of the main problems of our society. We learn, maybe not the famous TED audience, but so many other people learn, that the unknown, the doubts, the question marks are dangerous. And we have to resist to the changes. We have to keep everything under control. Well, the unknown is part of life.And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor. Because in the balloon, like in life, we go very well in unforeseen directions. We want to go in a direction, but the winds push us in another direction, like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally, against life, against the winds, against what's happening to us, life is a nightmare.How do we steer a balloon? By understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction. So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory, in life, or in the balloon, we have to change altitude. Changing altitude, in life, that means raising to another psychological, philosophical, spiritual level. But how do we do that?In ballooning, or in life, how do we change altitude? How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day? Well, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast. And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb. Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore. And I think in life it should be exactly like this.You know, when people speak about pioneering spirit, very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas. It's not true. The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas, because new ideas are so easy to have. We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas. No, the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast. Habits, certainties, convictions, exclamation marks, paradigms, dogmas. And when we are able to do that, what happens? Life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension. No. Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions.And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis. Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon, but in life itself. Explore this vertical axis, that means explore all the different ways to do, all the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think, before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish. This is very practical. This can be in politics. This can be in spirituality. This can be in environment, in finance, in education of children.I deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing. Because we will throw away these political dogmas. I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid \u2014 if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past. And that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas. Throwing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.Well, these basically are things I believed in such a long time. But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it. (Laughter) (Applause) It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take. Sometime we need friends, family members or a psychiatrist. Well, in balloons we need weather men, the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind, at which altitude, in order to help the balloonist. But sometimes it's very paradoxical.When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world, the weather man asked us, one day, to fly quite low, and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.And I was so proud to have found that jetstream that I called the weather man, and I told him, \"Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there? We fly twice the speed you predicted.\" And he told me, \"Don't do that. Go down immediately in order to slow down.\" And I started to argue. I said, \"I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow.\" And he told me, \"Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. (Laughter) And then he asked me \u2014 and this is something I will never forget in my life \u2014 he just asked me, \"You're the good pilot up there. What do you really want? You want to go very fast in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction? (Laughter) (Applause)And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long-term vision. And this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now, in the political governments. We are burning, as you heard, so much energy, not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long. So, we went down actually. We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers. But we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started.When we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays. We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane. In the middle of the Pacific, when you don't have the good winds, you cannot land, you cannot go back. That's a crisis. That's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking. That's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential, your creativity. That's when you throw out all the ballast, all the certainties, in order to adapt to the new situation.And actually, we changed completely our flight plan. We changed completely our strategy. And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt. But if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were. It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles. We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane. We landed with 40 kilos.When I saw that, I made a promise to myself. I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world, it would be with no fuel, independent from fossil energies, in order to be safe, not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington, together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh, with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer, with Chuck Yeager's 61, I had really a thought then. I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant. It allowed to do all those things there. But it will not be possible in the future any more. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now.So how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy? And this is when the project Solar Impulse really started to turn in my head. And I think it's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century. Pioneering spirit should continue, but on another level. Not to conquer the planet or space, not anymore, it has been done, but rather to improve the quality of life. How can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing? What is today completely impossible \u2014 get rid of our dependency on fossil energy.If you tell to people, we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world, people will laugh at you, except here, where crazy people are invited to speak. (Laughter) So, the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane, using absolutely no fuel, nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars, for heating systems, for computers, and so on and so on.Well, solar power airplanes are not new. They have flown in the past, but without saving capabilities, without batteries. Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it. If we want to show the potential, we have to fly day and night. That means to load the batteries during the flight, in order to spend the night on the batteries, and fly the next day again. It has been made, already, on remote controlled little airplane models, without pilots.But it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to it. I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities, that can talk to students, talk to politicians during the flight, and really make it a human adventure. For that, unfortunately, four meters wingspan is not enough. You need 64 meter wingspan. 64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries, flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency. Why that? Because fuel is not easy to replace. That's for sure. And with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane, we can produce the same energy than 200 little lightbulbs. That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.So the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree? People will tell you it's impossible, and that's exactly why we try to do it. We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg six years ago. We have now 70 people in the team working on it. We have gone through the stages of simulation, design, computing, preparing the construction of the first prototype. That has been achieved after two years of work. Cockpit, propeller, engine. Just the fuselage here, it's so light. It's not designed by an artist, but it could be. 50 kilos for the entire fuselage. Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.This is the complete structure of the airplane. And one month ago we have unveiled it. You cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision, it's a real airplane. A real airplane that we could finally present.And what's the goal now? The goal is to take off, end of this year for the first test, but mainly next year, spring or summer, take off, on our own power, without additional help, without being towed, climb to 9,000 meters altitude. The same time we load the batteries, we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height, we arrive at the beginning of the night. And there, there will be just one goal, just one: reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty. (Laughter)And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy, if the pilot wastes energy, we'll never make it through the night. And in our world, if we keep on spoiling, wasting our energy resources, if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt, it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem.So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And 20 years later there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic.So, we have to start, and show the example. A little bit like on this picture here. This is a painting from Magritte, in the museum in Holland that I love so much. It's a pipe, and it's written, \"This is not a pipe.\" This is not an airplane. This is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible, when we have a team, when we have pioneering spirit, and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard.What pleases me very much is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood. And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it, invited by politicians, invited in energy forums, in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies.So, through speeches like this one today, through interviews, through meetings, our goal is to get as many people possible on the team. The success will not come if we \"just,\" quote, unquote, fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane. No, the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life, save energy, go to renewables. And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today, we can save between 30 and 50 percent of the energy of a country in Europe, and we can solve half of the rest with renewables. It leaves 25 or 30 percent for oil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever. This is acceptable.This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team. You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing. But much more, to get advices, to give your comments, to spread the word that if it's possible in the air, of course it's possible in the ground.And each time we have some ice in the future, we have to know that life will be great, and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice, to go through the obstacle, to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side. So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side. Everyone has his goal, has his dreams, has his visions.The question I leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard? Which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life, to get to the success that you wish to have, to get to the point that really belongs to you, with the potential you have, and the one you can really fulfill? Because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential, and our own passion. So, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure in the wings of the future. Thank you.

00:00:19.958\nespecially at the end of these balloon flights\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\naround the world I did with Brian Jones.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nWhen I took this picture,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nthe window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd on the other side there was a rising sun.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nSo, you see that on the other side of ice\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nyou have the unknown,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nyou have the non-obvious,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nyou have the non-seen,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nfor the people who don't dare\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nto go through the ice.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThere are so many people\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nwho prefer to suffer in the ice they know\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\ninstead of taking the risk of going through the ice\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nto see what there is on the other side.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd I think that's one of the main problems of our society.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nWe learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nbut so many other people learn,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat the unknown, the doubts,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthe question marks are dangerous.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd we have to resist to the changes.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nWe have to keep everything under control.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nWell, the unknown is part of life.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nAnd in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nBecause in the balloon, like in life,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nwe go very well in unforeseen directions.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nWe want to go in a direction,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nbut the winds push us in another direction, like in life.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd as long as we fight horizontally,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nagainst life, against the winds,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nagainst what's happening to us,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nlife is a nightmare.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nHow do we steer a balloon?\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nBy understanding that the atmosphere\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nis made out of several different layers of wind\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nwhich all have different direction.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nSo, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nin life, or in the balloon,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nwe have to change altitude.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nChanging altitude, in life,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthat means raising to another psychological, philosophical,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nspiritual level.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nBut how do we do that?\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nIn ballooning, or in life,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nhow do we change altitude?\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nHow do we go from the metaphor\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nto something more practical that we can really\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nuse every day?\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nWell, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nSand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd I think in life it should be exactly like this.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nYou know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nvery often they believe that pioneers\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nare the ones who have new ideas.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nIt's not true.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nbecause new ideas are so easy to have.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nWe just close our eyes for a minute we all come back\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwith a lot of new ideas.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nNo, the pioneer is the one who\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nallows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nHabits, certainties,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nconvictions, exclamation marks,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nparadigms, dogmas.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd when we are able to do that,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwhat happens?\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nLife is not anymore\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\njust one line going in one direction\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nin one dimension. No.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nLife is going to be made out of all the possible lines\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthat go in all the possible directions\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nin three dimensions.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nto explore this vertical axis.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nOf course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nbut in life itself.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nExplore this vertical axis, that means\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nexplore all the different ways to do,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nall the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nbefore we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThis is very practical.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nThis can be in politics.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThis can be in spirituality.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThis can be in environment,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nin finance, in education of children.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI deeply believe\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthat life is a much greater adventure\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nif we manage to do politics\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nwithout the trench between the left and the right wing.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nBecause we will throw away these political dogmas.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nI deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nif we get rid -- if we throw overboard\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nthis fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd that we can aim for much higher spirituality\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nif we get rid of the religious dogmas.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThrowing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nWell, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nBut actually I had to go around the world in a balloon\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nto be invited to talk about it.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:56.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nIt's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand which altitude to take. Sometime we need\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nfriends, family members or a psychiatrist.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nWell, in balloons we need weather men,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthe one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nat which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBut sometimes it's very paradoxical.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nWhen Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthe weather man asked us, one day, to fly\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nquite low, and very slow.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\naround the world at that speed.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I was so proud to have found that jetstream\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nthat I called the weather man,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand I told him, \"Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nWe fly twice the speed you predicted.\"\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd he told me, \"Don't do that. Go down immediately\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nin order to slow down.\"\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd I started to argue. I said, \"I'm not going to do that.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nWe don't have enough gas to fly so slow.\"\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nAnd he told me, \"Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nif you fly too fast, in a couple of hours\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nyou will turn left and end up at the North Pole.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd then he asked me --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand this is something I will never forget in my life --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nhe just asked me, \"You're the good pilot up there.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nWhat do you really want? You want to go very fast\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nin the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAnd this is why you need weathermen.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThis is why you need people with long-term vision.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd this is precisely what fails\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nin the political visions we have now,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nin the political governments.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nWe are burning, as you heard,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nso much energy,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nnot understanding that such an unsustainable\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nway of life cannot last for long.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo, we went down actually.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nWe slowed down. And we went through moments of fears\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbecause we had no idea how the little amount of gas\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwe had in the balloon\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\ncould allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nBut we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd actually this is where the adventure really started.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWhen we were flying over the Sahara and India\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit was nice holidays.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nWe could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nIn the middle of the Pacific,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nwhen you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nyou cannot go back.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nThat's a crisis.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThat's the moment when you have to wake up\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nfrom the automatic way of thinking.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThat's the moment when you have to motivate\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nyour inner potential,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nyour creativity.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThat's when you throw out all the ballast,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nall the certainties,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nin order to adapt to the new situation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd actually, we changed completely our flight plan.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nWe changed completely our strategy.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nBut if I show you this picture\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nit's not to tell you how happy we were.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nIt's to show you how much gas was left\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nin the last bottles.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWe took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nWe landed with 40 kilos.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nWhen I saw that, I made a promise to myself.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nit would be with no fuel,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nindependent from fossil energies,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin order to be safe,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nnot to be threatened by the fuel gauge.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nI had no idea how it was possible.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nI just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nAnd when the capsule of my balloon was introduced\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nofficially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\ntogether with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwith Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwith Chuck Yeager's 61,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nI had really a thought then.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nI thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIt allowed to do all those things there.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nBut it will not be possible in the future any more.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIt takes too much energy. It will cost too much.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIt will be prohibited\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nbecause we'll have to save our natural resources\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nin a few decades from now.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSo how can we perpetuate\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthis pioneering spirit\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nwith something that will be independent from fossil energy?\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd this is when the project Solar Impulse\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nreally started to\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nturn in my head.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd I think it's a nice metaphor also\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nfor the 21st century.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nPioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nNot to conquer the planet or space,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nnot anymore, it has been done,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nbut rather to improve the quality of life.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nHow can we go through the ice of certainty\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nin order to make the most incredible a possible thing?\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nWhat is today completely impossible --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nget rid of our dependency on fossil energy.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nIf you tell to people, we want to be independent\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nfrom fossil energy in our world,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\npeople will laugh at you, except here,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nwhere crazy people are invited to speak.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo, the idea is that if we fly around the world\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nin a solar powered airplane,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nusing absolutely no fuel,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nnobody ever could say in the future\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthat it's impossible to do it\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor cars, for heating systems,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nfor computers, and so on and so on.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWell, solar power airplanes are not new.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThey have flown in the past, but without\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nsaving capabilities, without batteries.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWhich means that they have more proven\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthe limits of renewable energies\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nthan the potential of it.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nIf we want to show the potential,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nwe have to fly day and night.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nThat means to load the batteries during the flight,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nin order to spend the night on the batteries,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand fly the next day again.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nIt has been made, already, on remote controlled\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nlittle airplane models, without pilots.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nBut it stays an anecdote\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nbecause the public couldn't identify to it.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nI think you need a pilot in the plane\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthat can talk to the universities,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nthat can talk to students,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\ntalk to politicians during the flight,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand really make it a human adventure.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nFor that, unfortunately,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nfour meters wingspan is not enough.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nYou need 64 meter wingspan.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nflies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nWhy that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThat's for sure.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwe can produce the same energy\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthan 200 little lightbulbs.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThat means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nSo the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwith an airplane that uses\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nthe same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nPeople will tell you it's impossible,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand that's exactly why we try to do it.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nsix years ago.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nWe have now 70 people in the team working on it.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nWe have gone through the stages of simulation, design,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\ncomputing, preparing the construction\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nof the first prototype.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nThat has been achieved after two years of work.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nCockpit, propeller, engine.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nJust the fuselage here, it's so light.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nIt's not designed by an artist, but it could be.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\n50 kilos for the entire fuselage.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nCouple of kilos more for the wing spars.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThis is the complete structure of the airplane.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd one month ago we have unveiled it.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nYou cannot imagine how it is for a team\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwho has been working six years on it\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nto show that it's not only a dream and a vision,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nit's a real airplane.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nA real airplane that we could finally present.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd what's the goal now?\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nThe goal is to take off,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nend of this year for the first test,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbut mainly next year, spring or summer,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\ntake off, on our own power,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwithout additional help, without being towed,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nclimb to 9,000 meters altitude.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThe same time we load the batteries,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nwe run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwe arrive at the beginning of the night.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nAnd there, there will be just one goal, just one:\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nreach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd this is exactly the symbol of our world.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIf our airplane is too heavy,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nif the pilot wastes energy,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nwe'll never make it through the night.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nAnd in our world, if we keep on spoiling,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nwasting our energy resources,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nif we keep on building things that consume so much energy\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat most of the companies now go bankrupt,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nit's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nwithout a major problem.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nSo, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nI don't think it will transport 200 people\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nin the next years.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nBut when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthe payload was also just sufficient\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nfor one person and some fuel.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd 20 years later there were 200 people\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nin every airplane crossing the Atlantic.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo, we have to start,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand show the example.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nA little bit like on this picture here.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nThis is a painting from Magritte,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nin the museum in Holland that I love so much.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt's a pipe, and it's written, \"This is not a pipe.\"\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThis is not an airplane.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThis is a symbol of what we can achieve\n\n00:14:30.958 -->

Just think about this problem for a second. Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds, which you can hold in the palm of your hand. But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity, ask questions about the meaning of its own existence, about the nature of God.And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world. It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings: How does this all come about? Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons. We're looking at neurons here. There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain. And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain. And based on this, people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.So, how do you go about studying the brain? One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior. This is what I spoke about in the last TED. Today I'll talk about a different approach, which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain, and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain. Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.Now, one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy, in Parma, by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues, is a group of neurons called mirror neurons, which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes. Now, it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain, which have been known for over 50 years. These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action. For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple, a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire. If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire, commanding me to pull that object. These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons, maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action. So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something, but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something. And this is truly astonishing. Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view. It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action.Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons? For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation. Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view. So, this is important for imitation and emulation. Well, why is that important? Well, let's take a look at the next slide. So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important? Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation.Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture. If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago, let's look at human evolution, it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago. And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use, the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language, and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpret that person's behavior. All of that happened relatively quickly.Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago, 100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly. And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian. Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years. A polar bear, to evolve a coat, will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years. A human being, a child, can just watch its parent kill another polar bear, and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body, and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn, it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes. And then once it's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population.This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization. Now there is another kind of mirror neuron, which is involved in something quite different. And that is, there are mirror neurons, just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch. In other words, if somebody touches me, my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire when I simply watch another person being touched. So, it's empathizing the other person being touched.So, most of them will fire when I'm touched in different locations. Different neurons for different locations. But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. So, here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy. Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched, why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched? I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch. Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin, touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain and saying \"Don't worry, you're not being touched. So, empathize, by all means, with the other person, but do not actually experience the touch, otherwise you'll get confused and muddled.\"Okay, so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm, so you put an injection into my arm, anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb, and there is no sensations coming in, if I now watch you being touched, I literally feel it in my hand. In other words, you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons. (Laughter)And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense. All that's separating you from him, from the other person, is your skin. Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind. You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy, and that is there is no real independent self, aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world, inspecting other people. You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet, you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other. And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy. It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience. So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else being touched, you feel it in your phantom. Now the astonishing thing is, if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand, massage the other person's hand, that relieves the pain in your phantom hand, almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged.So, here you have my last slide. For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct. C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures: science on the one hand, humanities on the other; never the twain shall meet. So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness, representation of self, what separates you from other human beings, what allows you to empathize with other human beings, and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization, which is unique to human beings.

Why is imitation important?\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nMirror neurons and imitation, emulation.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nNow, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nIf you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nlet's look at human evolution, it turns out\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthat something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nof a number of skills that are unique to human beings\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nlike tool use,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthe use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand the ability to read somebody else's mind\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand interpret that person's behavior.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAll of that happened relatively quickly.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nEven though the human brain had achieved its present size\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nalmost three or four hundred thousand years ago,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\n100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nAnd I claim that what happened was\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthe sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwhich allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nSo that when there was a sudden accidental discovery\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nby one member of the group, say the use of fire,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nor a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthis spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nor was transmitted vertically, down the generations.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\ninstead of Darwinian.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nDarwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nA polar bear, to evolve a coat,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nwill take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nA human being, a child, can just watch its parent\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nkill another polar bear,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand learn it in one step. What the polar bear\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\ntook 100,000 years to learn,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nit can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd then once it's learned this it spreads\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nin geometric proportion across a population.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThis is the basis. The imitation of complex skills\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nis what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nNow there is another kind of mirror neuron,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwhich is involved in something quite different.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd that is, there are mirror neurons,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\njust as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nIn other words, if somebody touches me,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nmy hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nin the sensory region of the brain fires.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nBut the same neuron, in some cases, will fire\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhen I simply watch another person being touched.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nSo, it's empathizing the other person being touched.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nSo, most of them will fire when I'm touched\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nin different locations. Different neurons for different locations.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nBut a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nbeing touched in the same location.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo, here again you have neurons\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nwhich are enrolled in empathy.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nNow, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nmerely by watching somebody being touched?\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWell, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\ntouch and pain receptors, going back into your brain\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand saying \"Don't worry, you're not being touched.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nSo, empathize, by all means, with the other person,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nbut do not actually experience the touch,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\notherwise you'll get confused and muddled.\"\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nOkay, so there is a feedback signal\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\npreventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nBut if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nso you put an injection into my arm,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nanesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand there is no sensations coming in,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nif I now watch you being touched,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nI literally feel it in my hand.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nIn other words, you have dissolved the barrier\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nbetween you and other human beings.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSo, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:05:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nAnd this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nAll that's separating you from him,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nfrom the other person, is your skin.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nRemove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nYou've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand that is there is no real independent self,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\naloof from other human beings, inspecting the world,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ninspecting other people.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nYou are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nyou're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nAnd there is no real distinctiveness\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nof your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIt emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nSo, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nbeing touched, you feel it in your phantom.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nNow the astonishing thing is,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nif you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nmassage the other person's hand,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthat relieves the pain in your phantom hand,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nalmost as though the neuron\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nwere obtaining relief from merely\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwatching somebody else being massaged.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo, here you have my last slide.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nFor the longest time people have regarded science\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand humanities as being distinct.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nC.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nscience on the one hand, humanities on the other;\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nnever the twain shall meet.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nallowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nrepresentation of self,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwhat separates you from other human beings,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwhat allows you to empathize with other human beings,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nwhich is unique to human beings. Thank you.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Exposing the invisible", "duration": "798", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_veasey_exposing_the_invisible_1", "transcript": "So, 120 years ago, Dr. R\u00f6ntgen X-rayed his wife's hand. Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me. That image was the start of the X-ray technology. And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today. I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.The first shot I ever did was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know, so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it. But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day. And I do really like this shot, because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers. It was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time.Moving on to something a bit larger, this is an X-ray of a bus. And the bus is full of people. It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton. And back in the '60s, they used to teach student radiographers to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I, but on dead people. So, I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid, because she's very old and fragile. But everyone on that bus is Frieda. And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray, which is the sort of machine you have on borders, which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.Fairly obvious what that is. So, using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often. Technology is moving ahead, and these large cargo scanner X-rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better. Again though, to make it come alive you need, somehow, to add the human element. And I think the reason this image works, again, is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer. (Laughter)Quite a difficult brief, make a pair of men's pants look beautiful. But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are. Fashion \u2014 now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I don't show the surface, I show what's within. So, the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it, it looks the same. (Laughter) We all look the same inside, believe me. The creases in the material and the sort of nuances. And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of. I peel back the layers and expose it. And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design. The design comes from within. It's not just Topshop, I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props. Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises. I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died. And what's really interesting is, if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused. And should that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway. (Laughter) But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy.So, that's an empty parka jacket. But I quite love the way it's posed. Nature is my greatest inspiration. And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture. If you look at the roof of the Eden Project, or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure. And I'm sure those architects are inspired, as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature. This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond. An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional. Seaweed, ebbing in the tide. Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed. And the door to my X-ray room is made of lead and steel. It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it. (Laughter) The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete. So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation. A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's. And there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine. What's interesting really about X-ray really is, if you think about it, is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs, or looking for contraband or whatever. And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful.So, still working with film, I'm afraid. Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed, apart from these large cargo-scanning machines, hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it, which is show my pictures big. So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner, which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film. They scan each individual X-ray. And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays. So, this is, again, my daughter's dress. Still has the tag in it from me buying it, so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it. But there are four X-ray plates. You can see them overlapping.So, when you move forward from something fairly small, a dress which is this size, onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process, you can see that that is a lot of work. In fact, that is three months solid X-raying. There is over 500 separate components. Boeing sent me a 747 in containers. And I sent them back an X-ray. (Laughter) I kid you not.Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton. This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures. One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer. The one on the left is an x-ray. But this time I had to use a real body. Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real, to make it look like it was a real athlete. So, here I had to use a recently deceased body. And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious. But people do donate their bodies to art and science. And when they do, I'm in the queue. So, I like to use them. (Laughter)The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays. It makes it more organic, more natural. It's whatever takes my fancy, really. It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life. That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think. But I just like it in bright orange. And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks, it sort of adds another level. It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.The most difficult things to X-ray, the most technically challenging things to X-ray are the lightest things, the most delicate things. To get the detail in a feather, believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays, that's quite a challenge. I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.Video: (Music) The thing in there is very dangerous. If you touch that, you could possibly die through radiation poisoning. In my career I've had two exposures to radiation, which is two too many, because it stays with you for life. It's cumulative.(Music) It has human connotations. The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize, but also it looks like it's a robot, and it comes from a sci-fi genus. It's a surprise that it has humanity, but also man-made, future, alien associations. And it's just a bit spooky.(Music) The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine, which is used on the borders between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants. The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices of X-rays through the lorry. And that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice. It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices. And then if you look carefully, there is all little things. He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper, got a hat on, glasses, got a bag. So, these little details help to make it work, make it real.(Music) The problem with using living people is that to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation. So, to avoid that \u2014 I have to avoid it somehow \u2014 is I use dead people. Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies, to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X-rays of the human body, at different densities.(Music) I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.(Music) I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds, I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem. Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves. Look at this monster.(Music) It's so basic. It just grows wild. That's what I really like about it, the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it, and it hasn't been genetically modified at all. It's just happening. And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be. Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye, the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other. So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners. The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs, and the more time it needs. The lighter the object, the less radiation. Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail. The longer the exposure goes on for, the more detail you get.(Music) If you look at this, just the tube, it is quite bright. But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer. So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear. What I like is how hard the edges are, how sharp. Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.(Music) I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth, for what it's really made of, how it really works. But also I find that I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface, which is things that people are used to seeing.And that's the sort of thing I've been doing. I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future. This is a commercial application of my most recent work. And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time, like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera. Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision. I do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep. And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.So, what am I doing in the future? Well, this year is the 50th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars. So, I've taken it apart, component by component, months and months and months of work. And with this image, I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box, which is actually attached to the car. So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle, not an easy task, in itself. And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down, and up against you is a wall. And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car, you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.And I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life. Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life. And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box. And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray. I'm also looking to take my work from the two-dimensional form to a more three-dimensional form. And this is quite a good way of doing it. I'm also working now with X-ray video. So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers, and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning. But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.

It seems a bit extreme to me.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nThat image was the start of the X-ray technology.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nI'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nThe first shot I ever did\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwas of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nso I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nBut the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd I do really like this shot, because\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nit shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nin the sole of the sneakers.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nIt was just one of those pot-luck things where you\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nget it right first time.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nMoving on to something a bit larger,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthis is an X-ray of a bus.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nAnd the bus is full of people.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nIt's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd back in the '60s,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthey used to teach student radiographers\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nto take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nbut on dead people.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nSo, I've still got access to one of these dead people\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\ncalled Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nbecause she's very old and fragile.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nBut everyone on that bus is Frieda.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nAnd the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nwhich is the sort of machine you have on borders,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nwhich checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nFairly obvious what that is.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo, using large-scale objects\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\ndoes sort of create drama\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nbecause you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nTechnology is moving ahead,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand these large cargo scanner X-rays\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthat work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAgain though, to make it come alive\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nyou need, somehow, to add the human element.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAnd I think the reason this image works, again, is because\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nFrieda is driving the bulldozer.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nQuite a difficult brief,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nmake a pair of men's pants look beautiful.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nBut I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nFashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\ndon't show the surface, I show what's within.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nSo, the fashionistas don't really like me\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbecause it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nit looks the same.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWe all look the same inside, believe me.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThe creases in the material and the sort of nuances.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nI peel back the layers and expose it.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nThe design comes from within.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nIt's not just Topshop,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nI get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nHere I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nof a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nI live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd what's really interesting is,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nif you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd should that pig have grown,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nunfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nafter I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:02:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nBut once the bones had fused together\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nit would have been healthy.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo, that's an empty parka jacket.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nBut I quite love the way it's posed.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nNature is my greatest inspiration.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nis how nature is related to architecture.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nIf you look at the roof of the Eden Project,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nor the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd I'm sure those architects are inspired,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nas I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThis, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthat floats on the top of a pond.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAn amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nSeaweed, ebbing in the tide.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nNow, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThis is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd the door to my X-ray room\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nis made of lead and steel.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nIt weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThe walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nSo, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nA lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nWhat's interesting really about X-ray really\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nis, if you think about it, is that that technology\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nis used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nor looking for contraband or whatever.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd I use that sort of technology\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nto create things that are quite beautiful.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo, still working with film, I'm afraid.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nTechnology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\napart from these large cargo-scanning machines,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nhasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwhich is show my pictures big.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nwhich was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThey scan each individual X-ray.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nSo, this is, again, my daughter's dress.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nStill has the tag in it from me buying it,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nBut there are four X-ray plates.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nYou can see them overlapping.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nSo, when you move forward from something fairly small,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\na dress which is this size,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nonto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nyou can see that that is a lot of work.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nIn fact, that is three months solid X-raying.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nThere is over 500 separate components.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBoeing sent me a 747 in containers.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd I sent them back an X-ray.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\n(Laughter) I kid you not.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nOkay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThis, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nOne on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThe one on the left is an x-ray.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nBut this time I had to use a real body.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBecause I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto make it look like it was a real athlete.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo, here I had to use a recently deceased body.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut people do donate their bodies to art and science.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd when they do, I'm in the queue.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nSo, I like to use them.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThe coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nIt makes it more organic, more natural.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nIt's whatever takes my fancy, really.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThat flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nBut I just like it in bright orange.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nit sort of adds another level.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nIt makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe most difficult things to X-ray,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthe most technically challenging things to X-ray\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nare the lightest things, the most delicate things.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nTo get the detail in a feather,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nbelieve me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthat's quite a challenge.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nI'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nVideo: (Music)\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThe thing in there is very dangerous.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nIf you touch that, you could possibly die\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthrough radiation poisoning.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nIn my career I've had two exposures to radiation,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwhich is two too many, because it stays with you for life.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt's cumulative.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\n(Music)\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nIt has human connotations.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThe fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nbut also it looks like it's a robot,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand it comes from a sci-fi genus.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nIt's a surprise that it has humanity,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nbut also man-made, future, alien associations.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd it's just a bit spooky.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n(Music)\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThe bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwhich is used on the borders\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nbetween countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThe lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof X-rays through the lorry.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nAnd then if you look carefully, there is all little things.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nHe's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\ngot a hat on, glasses, got a bag.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo, these little details\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nhelp to make it work, make it real.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\n(Music)\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThe problem with using living people is that\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nto take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, to avoid that --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nI have to avoid it somehow --\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nis I use dead people.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nNow, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nto a skeleton that was used by student radiographers\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nto train in taking X-rays of the human body,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nat different densities.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nI have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nI will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nI'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nBecause it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nLook at this monster.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt's so basic. It just grows wild.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nThat's what I really like about it,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand it hasn't been genetically modified at all.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nIt's just happening.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nAnd the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nNot that that is particularly beautiful\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nwhen you look at it with the human eye,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthe way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThe thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand the more time it needs.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThe lighter the object, the less radiation.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nSometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThe longer the exposure goes on for,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nthe more detail you get.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Music)\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nIf you look at this, just the tube,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nit is quite bright.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nBut I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nWhat I like is how hard the edges are,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nhow sharp.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nYeah, I'm quite pleased with it.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\n(Music)\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nI travel beyond the surface and show\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nsomething for what it's worth,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nfor what it's really made of, how it really works.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nBut also I find that\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nI've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwhich is things that people are used to seeing.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd that's the sort of thing I've been doing.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nI've got the opportunity now to show you\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwhat I'm going to be doing in the future.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nThis is a commercial application of my most recent work.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nlike you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nand you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nUnfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nI do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo, what am I doing in the future?\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nWell, this year is the 50th anniversary\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nof Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nSo, I've taken it apart, component by component,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nmonths and months and months of work.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd with this image, I'm going to be displaying\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nit in the Victoria and Albert Museum\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nas a light box, which is actually attached to the car.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nSo, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nnot an easy task, in itself.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand up against you is a wall.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nyou see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd I'm going to take that idea\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nand apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nLike, my first computer was a big movement in my life.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nAnd I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nI'm also looking to\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\ntake my work from the two-dimensional form\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto a more three-dimensional form.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nAnd this is quite a good way of doing it.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nI'm also working now with X-ray video.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nand they're actually moving and growing\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nBut that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How to live to be 100+", "duration": "1179", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100", "transcript": "Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes. The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle. So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity.But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you. They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet. You have the USDA food pyramid. There is what Oprah tells us. There is what Doctor Oz tells us.The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better. Should you be running marathons or doing yoga? Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu? When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them? How about these hormones or resveratrol? And does purpose play into it? Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?Well, our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic, and the National Institute on Aging, to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined. And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do, to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is. But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity. And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100. False. The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100. Your chances are very low. Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America, it's hard to reach 100. The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity. We are programmed for something called procreative success. I love that word. It reminds me of my college days.Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation, the age when your children have children. After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates. If you're a mammal, if you're a rat or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story. So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won the genetic lottery.The second myth is, there are treatments that can help slow, reverse, or even stop aging. False. When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us. Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes, those brain cells die, they never come back. Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage, the cartilage never comes back. Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque, and we can get Alzheimer's. There is just too many things to go wrong.Our bodies have 35 trillion cells, trillion with a \"T.\" We're talking national debt numbers here. (Laughter) Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years. And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up. And it builds up exponentially. It's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape, and let our friends copy that cassette tape, and pretty soon, with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage. Well, the same things happen to our cells. That's why a 65-year-old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year-old person.So, if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging, what am I doing here? Well, the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body, my body, your body, is about 90 years, a little bit more for women. But life expectancy in this country is only 78. So somewhere along the line, we're leaving about 12 good years on the table. These are years that we could get. And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them, areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are, areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years, the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country.We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia. And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people, but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province. And here we have this area where men live the longest, about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America. And this is a place where people not only reach age 100, they do so with extraordinary vigor. Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work, chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them. (Laughter)Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ. It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated. Because the land is so infertile, they largely are shepherds, which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity. Their diet is mostly plant-based, accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields. They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat, a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals, and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world. It's called Cannonau.But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society. And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people. You ever notice here in America, social equity seems to peak at about age 24? Just look at the advertisements. Here in Sardinia, the older you get the more equity you have, the more wisdom you're celebrated for. You go into the bars in Sardinia, instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar, you see the centenarian of the month calendar.This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family \u2014 it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy \u2014 research shows it's also good for the children of those families, who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease. That's called the grandmother effect.We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet, about 800 miles south of Tokyo, on the archipelago of Okinawa. Okinawa is actually 161 small islands. And in the northern part of the main island, this is ground zero for world longevity. This is a place where the oldest living female population is found. It's a place where people have the longest disability-free life expectancy in the world. They have what we want. They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep, very quickly, and often, I can tell you, after sex.They live about seven good years longer than the average American. Five times as many centenarians as we have in America. One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer, big killers here in America. And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease. And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us. What do they do? Once again, a plant-based diet, full of vegetables with lots of color in them. And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do.More significant than what they eat is how they eat it. They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating, which, as you know, is a big problem here in America. A few of the strategies we observed: they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting. Instead of serving family style, where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking, they serve at the counter, put the food away, and then bring it to the table.They also have a 3,000-year-old adage, which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented. It was invented by Confucius. And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet. It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full. It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain. And by remembering to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing.But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity. We know that isolation kills. Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends. We're down to one and half right now. If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa, you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life. They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck, and if things go bad, child gets sick, parent dies, you always have somebody who has your back. This particular Moai, these five ladies have been together for 97 years. Their average age is 102.Typically in America we've divided our adult life up into two sections. There is our work life, where we're productive. And then one day, boom, we retire. And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair, or going down to Arizona to play golf. In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life, and that word is \"ikigai.\" And, roughly translated, it means \"the reason for which you wake up in the morning.\"For this 102-year-old karate master, his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art. For this hundred-year-old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week. And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians. And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute, the people who put the questionnaire. One of the questions was, \"What is your ikigai?\" They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning. For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter. Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years. And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter. And she put her head back and she said, \"It feels like leaping into heaven.\" I thought that was a wonderful thought.My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America's Blue Zone. And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota, where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians. But that's because all the young people left. (Laughter) So, we turned to the data again. And we found America's longest-lived population among the Seventh-Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California. Adventists are conservative Methodists. They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday. A \"24-hour sanctuary in time,\" they call it. And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity, comparatively speaking.In America here, life expectancy for the average woman is 80. But for an Adventist woman, their life expectancy is 89. And the difference is even more pronounced among men, who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their American counterparts. Now, this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years. Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project.This is a heterogeneous community. It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian. The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives. They take their diet directly from the Bible. Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29], where God talks about legumes and seeds, and on one more stanza about green plants, ostensibly missing is meat. They take this sanctuary in time very serious.For 24 hours every week, no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work, where the kids need to be driven, they stop everything and they focus on their God, their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion, are nature walks. And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally, the power is it's done every week for a lifetime. None of it's hard. None of it costs money. Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists. So, if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. Instead they're talking about their next nature walk, exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray. But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham. Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old. He's a multimillionaire, yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence, he said, \"For that kind of money I'll do it myself.\" So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement, and hauling poles around. And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room. But not as the guy on the table; the guy doing open-heart surgery. At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now, an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim. And on weekends he likes to put on the boards, throw up rooster tails.And then Marge Deton. Marge is 104. Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here. She starts her day with lifting weights. She rides her bicycle. And then she gets in her root-beer colored 1994 Cadillac Seville, and tears down the San Bernardino freeway, where she still volunteers for seven different organizations. I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions. I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen. But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton. \"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!\" she'd say to me.So, what are the common denominators in these three cultures? What are the things that they all do? And we managed to boil it down to nine. In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true. And the first one, and I'm about to utter a heresy here, none of them exercise, at least the way we think of exercise. Instead, they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity. These 100-year-old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor, 30 or 40 times a day.Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs. Every trip to the store, or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. They don't have any conveniences. There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand. That's physical activity. That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does. When they do do intentional physical activity, it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk, the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline, and they all tend to have a garden. They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook.Each of these cultures take time to downshift. The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray. The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration. But when you're in a hurry or stressed out, that triggers something called the inflammatory response, which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease. When you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state.They have vocabulary for sense of purpose, ikigai, like the Okinawans. You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born, because of infant mortality, and the year you retire. These people know their sense of purpose, and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy.There's no longevity diet. Instead, these people drink a little bit every day, not a hard sell to the American population. (Laughter) They tend to eat a plant-based diet. Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts. And they have strategies to keep from overeating, little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.And then the foundation of all this is how they connect. They put their families first, take care of their children and their aging parents. They all tend to belong to a faith-based community, which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month. And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.We know from the Framingham studies, that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight. So, if you hang out with unhealthy people, that's going to have a measurable impact over time. Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey, biking or gardening, if your friends drink a little, but not too much, and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy, that is going to have the biggest impact over time.Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population. Exercise programs usually start in January; they're usually done by October. When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. But when you think about it, your friends are long-term adventures, and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life, and life to your years. Thank you very much.

And how about how we socialize?\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nWell, our approach to finding longevity\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nwas to team up with National Geographic,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand the National Institute on Aging,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto find the four demographically confirmed areas\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nthat are geographically defined.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd then bring a team of experts in there\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nto methodically go through exactly what these people do,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nto distill down the cross-cultural distillation.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nBut first I'd like to debunk some common myths\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwhen it comes to longevity.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd the first myth is if you try really hard\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nyou can live to be 100.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nFalse.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nThe problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nin America live to be 100.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nYour chances are very low.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nEven though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nit's hard to reach 100.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nThe problem is\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nthat we're not programmed for longevity.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nWe are programmed for something called\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nprocreative success.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI love that word.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nIt reminds me of my college days.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBiologists term procreative success to mean\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthe age where you have children\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand then another generation, the age when your children have children.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAfter that the effect of evolution\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\ncompletely dissipates.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIf you're a mammal, if you're a rat\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nor an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo to make it to age 100, you not only have to have\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nhad a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nthe genetic lottery.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe second myth is,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthere are treatments that can help slow,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nreverse, or even stop aging.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nFalse.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nWhen you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nDeprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nthose brain cells die, they never come back.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nPlay tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthe cartilage never comes back.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nOur arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand we can get Alzheimer's.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThere is just too many things to go wrong.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nOur bodies have 35 trillion cells,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\ntrillion with a \"T.\" We're talking national debt numbers here.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nThose cells turn themselves over once every eight years.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd every time they turn themselves over\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthere is some damage. And that damage builds up.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nAnd it builds up exponentially.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt's a little bit like the days when we all had\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nBeatles albums or Eagles albums\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand let our friends copy that cassette tape,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand pretty soon, with successive generations\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nthat tape sounds like garbage.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nWell, the same things happen to our cells.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThat's why a 65-year-old person\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nis aging at a rate of about\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\n125 times faster\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthan a 12-year-old person.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nSo, if there is nothing you can do\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nto slow your aging or stop your aging,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwhat am I doing here?\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWell, the fact of the matter is\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthe best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nmy body, your body,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nis about 90 years,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\na little bit more for women.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nBut life expectancy in this country\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis only 78.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo somewhere along the line,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwe're leaving about 12 good years on the table.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThese are years that we could get.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nheart disease, cancer and diabetes.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nWe think the best way to get these missing years\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nis to look at the cultures around the world\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat are actually experiencing them,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nareas where people are living to age 100\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nat rates up to 10 times greater than we are,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nareas where the life expectancy\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nis an extra dozen years,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nthe rate of middle age mortality is a fraction\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nof what it is in this country.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nWe found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\noff the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nAnd not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nbut only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd here we have this area where men live the longest,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nabout 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd this is a place where people not only reach age 100,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthey do so with extraordinary vigor.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nPlaces where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nchop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nTheir history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nIt's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nBecause the land is so infertile,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthey largely are shepherds,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwhich occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nTheir diet is mostly plant-based,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\naccentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThey came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ncalled carta musica made out of durum wheat,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\na type of cheese made from grass-fed animals\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nso the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\ninstead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand a type of wine that has three times the level\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof polyphenols than any known wine in the world.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nIt's called Cannonau.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nBut the real secret I think lies more\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nin the way that they organize their society.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nis how they treat older people.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nYou ever notice here in America, social equity\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nseems to peak at about age 24?\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nJust look at the advertisements.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHere in Sardinia, the older you get\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nthe more equity you have,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe more wisdom you're celebrated for.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nYou go into the bars in Sardinia,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\ninstead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nyou see the centenarian of the month calendar.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThis, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nto keep them close to the family --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nit imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nresearch shows it's also good for the children of those families,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwho have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThat's called the grandmother effect.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWe found our second Blue Zone\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\non the other side of the planet,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nabout 800 miles south of Tokyo,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\non the archipelago of Okinawa.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nOkinawa is actually 161 small islands.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd in the northern part of the main island,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthis is ground zero for world longevity.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThis is a place where the oldest living female population is found.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nIt's a place where people have the longest disability-free\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nlife expectancy in the world.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThey have what we want.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThey live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nvery quickly,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nand often, I can tell you, after sex.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThey live about seven good years longer than the average American.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nFive times as many centenarians as we have in America.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nOne fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nbig killers here in America.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nsuggests strongly they have something to teach us.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nWhat do they do?\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nOnce again, a plant-based diet,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nfull of vegetables with lots of color in them.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAnd they eat about eight times as much tofu\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nas Americans do.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nMore significant than what they eat is how they eat it.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThey have all kinds of little strategies\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nto keep from overeating,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nwhich, as you know, is a big problem here in America.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nA few of the strategies we observed:\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthey eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nInstead of serving family style,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nwhere you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nthey serve at the counter, put the food away,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand then bring it to the table.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThey also have a 3,000-year-old adage,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nwhich I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nIt was invented by Confucius.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt's simply a little saying these people say before their meal\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nto remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIt takes about a half hour for that full feeling\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nto travel from your belly to your brain.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd by remembering to stop at 80 percent\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nit helps keep you from doing that very thing.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nBut, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthat we can associate with longevity.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nWe know that isolation kills.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nFifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nWe're down to one and half right now.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIf you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nyou were born into a system where you\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nautomatically have a half a dozen friends\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nwith whom you travel through life.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThey call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nyou're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand if things go bad,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nchild gets sick, parent dies,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nyou always have somebody who has your back.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThis particular Moai, these five ladies\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nhave been together for 97 years.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nTheir average age is 102.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nTypically in America\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nwe've divided our adult life up into two sections.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThere is our work life,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwhere we're productive.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd then one day, boom, we retire.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd typically that has meant\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nretiring to the easy chair,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nor going down to Arizona to play golf.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIn the Okinawan language there is not even\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\na word for retirement.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nInstead there is one word\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthat imbues your entire life,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand that word is \"ikigai.\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nAnd, roughly translated, it means\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\n\"the reason for which you wake up in the morning.\"\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nFor this 102-year-old karate master,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nhis ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nFor this hundred-year-old fisherman\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nit was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd this is a question. The National Institute on Aging\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nactually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthe people who put the questionnaire.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nOne of the questions was, \"What is your ikigai?\"\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThey instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nFor this 102 year old woman, her ikigai\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwas simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nTwo girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd I asked her what it felt like\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nto hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nAnd she put her head back and she said,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n\"It feels like leaping into heaven.\"\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nI thought that was a wonderful thought.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nMy editor at Geographic\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwanted me to find America's Blue Zone.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwhere actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nBut that's because all the young people left.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nSo, we turned to the data again.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd we found America's longest-lived population\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\namong the Seventh-Day Adventists\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nconcentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAdventists are conservative Methodists.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nThey celebrate their Sabbath\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nfrom sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nA \"24-hour sanctuary in time,\" they call it.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd they follow five little habits\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat conveys to them extraordinary longevity,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ncomparatively speaking.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIn America here, life expectancy\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nfor the average woman is 80.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nBut for an Adventist woman,\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ntheir life expectancy is 89.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd the difference is even more pronounced among men,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwho are expected to live about 11 years\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nlonger than their American counterparts.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nNow, this is a study that followed\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nabout 70,000 people for 30 years.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nSterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe premise of this Blue Zone project.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThis is a heterogeneous community.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nIt's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nThe only thing that they have in common are a set of\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nvery small lifestyle habits\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthat they follow ritualistically\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nfor most of their lives.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThey take their diet directly from the Bible.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nGenesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nwhere God talks about legumes and seeds,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand on one more stanza about green plants,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nostensibly missing is meat.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nThey take this sanctuary in time very serious.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nFor 24 hours every week,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nno matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nwhere the kids need to be driven,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthey stop everything and they focus on their God,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\ntheir social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nare nature walks.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nthe power is it's done every week for a lifetime.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nNone of it's hard. None of it costs money.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nAdventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nSo, if you go to an Adventist's party\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nyou don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nInstead they're talking about their next nature walk,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nexchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nBut they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThis is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nEllsworth Whareham is 97 years old.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nHe's a multimillionaire,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nyet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nto build a privacy fence,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nhe said, \"For that kind of money I'll do it myself.\"\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand hauling poles around.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nhe ended up in the operating room.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nBut not as the guy on the table;\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthe guy doing open-heart surgery.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAt 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nEd Rawlings, 103 years old now,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nan active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd on weekends he likes to put on the boards,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nthrow up rooster tails.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nAnd then Marge Deton.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nMarge is 104.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nHer grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nShe starts her day with lifting weights.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nShe rides her bicycle.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd then she gets in her root-beer colored\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\n1994 Cadillac Seville,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand tears down the San Bernardino freeway,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nwhere she still volunteers for seven different organizations.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nI've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI'm probably the only person you'll ever meet\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nwho rode his bicycle across\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nthe Sahara desert without sunscreen.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nBut I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthan riding shotgun with Marge Deton.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:34.958\n\"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!\" she'd say to me.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nSo, what are the common denominators\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nin these three cultures?\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nWhat are the things that they all do?\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd we managed to boil it down to nine.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nIn fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nand these common denominators hold true.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nAnd the first one,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nand I'm about to utter a heresy here,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nnone of them exercise,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nat least the way we think of exercise.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nInstead, they set up their lives\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nso that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nThese 100-year-old Okinawan women\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nare getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n30 or 40 times a day.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nSardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nEvery trip to the store, or to church\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nor to a friend's house occasions a walk.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nThey don't have any conveniences.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nThere is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nIf they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nThat's physical activity.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nThat burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nWhen they do do intentional physical activity,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nit's the things they enjoy.

Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you. And by the way, if I come across as a sort of rabid, hippie conservationist, it's purely a figment of your imagination. (Laughter)Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival. And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb, of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet. We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we? And today is a time for me to talk to you about water. It's not only because we like to drink lots of it, and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc. And, of course, watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers, but for several other reasons as well.When I was a kid, growing up in New York, I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls. And my mother, brave lady, was partly to blame, taking me to the New York Natural History Museum, buying me books on snakes, and then starting this infamous career of mine, which has culminated in of course, arriving in India 60 years ago, brought by my mother, Doris Norden, and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.It's been a roller coaster ride. Two animals, two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on. One of them was the remarkable gharial. This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers, and this charismatic snake, the king cobra. What my purpose of the talk today really is, is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures. Because this is what you will take away from here, a reconnection with nature, I hope.The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons. What you're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here, of a female king cobra making her nest. Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves, and then laying her eggs inside, to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall], in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days, and hatch into little baby king cobras. So, she protects her eggs, and after three months, the babies finally do hatch out. A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.My first experience with king cobras was in '72 at a magical place called Agumbe, in Karnataka, this state. And it is a marvelous rain forest. This first encounter was kind of like the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior. It really changed my life totally. And it brought me straight into the conservation fray. I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe, which you are all of course invited to visit.This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system, and try to hang on to what's there, make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean, and of course, having a good time too. You can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there. It was very important for us to get through to the people. And through the children is usually the way to go. They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way. They are interested. And it really works to start with them. This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.This is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long. And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom, and was hanging around there for two or three days. The people of this part of India worship the king cobra. And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it. Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras over the last three years, and relocated them in nearby forests.But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures [it was necessary] for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake. Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets, where the babies go after they hatch, and remarkable things like this you're about to see. This was just a few days ago in Agumbe. I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper. And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself. And king cobras feed only on snakes. This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it, what we'd call a \"vadai\" or a donut or something like that. (Laughter)Usually they eat something a bit larger. In this case a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season, wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra, didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it. We're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this.But they do also a lot of other remarkable things. This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes. This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra. And they did this incredible ritual combat dance. It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans, you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed. It's just a wresting match, but a remarkable activity.Now, what are we doing with all this information? What's the point of all this? Well, the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests. And our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected. And this is one of the ways we do it, by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there, in order to help protect trees, animals and of course the water sources.You've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger which started back in the early '70s, which was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation. We were piloted, I could say, by a highly autocratic stateswoman, but who also had an incredible passion for environment. And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged. And, just like Project Tiger, our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it. So, the tiger is the icon. And now the king cobra is a new one.All the major rivers in south India are sourced in the Western Ghats, the chain of hills running along the west coast of India. It pours out millions of gallons every hour, and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people, and washes many, many babies, and of course feeds many, many animals, both domestic and wild, produces thousands of tons of rice.And what do we do? How do we respond to this? Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it, we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides. You drink it in peril of your life. And the thing is, it's not just big industry. It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this; it's us. It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage are in water sources. Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.North central India, the Chambal River is where we have our base. This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile. It is an animal which has been on the Earth for just about 100 million years. It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off. It has remarkable features. Even though it grows to 20 feet long, since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings. It does have big teeth, however, and it's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.But we, actually, back in the early '70s, did surveys, and found that gharial were extremely rare. In fact, if you see the map, the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma. And now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India. So, in fact at this point there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild. So, starting in the mid-'70s when conservation was at the fore, we were actually able to start projects which were basically government supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release 5,000 baby gharial back to the wild. And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this. I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again.But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt. And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river, like sand mining, for example, very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge, not allowing the animals to breed anymore, we're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial, despite the early good intentions. Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight. This was actually just taken last year. But then the monsoon arrives, and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage, and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.Luckily there is still a lot of interest. My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN, the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments, and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff. But it's possibly, and definitely not enough. For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008, there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River. Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead. Why? How could it happen?This is a relatively clean river. The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water. People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it, something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers. So, in order to try to find out the answer to this, we got veterinarians from all over the world working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening. I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside. And we actually looked through all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on. And it came down to something called gout, which, as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body, and worse in the joints, which made the gharial unable to swim. And it's a horribly painful death.Just downriver from the Chambal is the filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river. And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine. It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra, and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine. So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain, something in the fish they were eating. And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected, including us.Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course. In order to try to answer some of these questions, we again turn to technology, to biological technology, in this case, again, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial, and actually following their movements. They're being watched everyday as we speak, to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is.The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place. It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits, the dacoits who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around. But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie, \"The Bandit Queen,\" which I urge you to see. You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.But, again, heavy fishing pressures. This is one of the last repositories of the Ganges river dolphin, various species of turtles, thousands of migratory birds, and fishing is causing problems like this. And now [these] new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don't drown in the net, then they simply cut their beaks off. Animals like the Ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left, and it is also critically endangered.So, who is next? Us? Because we are all dependent on these water sources. So, we all know about the Narmada river, the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods. And development just basically going berserk, for a double figure growth index, basically. So, we're not sure where this story is going to end, whether it's got a happy or sad ending. And climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads. We're still working hard at it. We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.And the thing is, you know, the decision makers, the folks in power, they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi, in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool. But out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape. And it's a bleak future for them. So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it, and nothing to show for it. Incredible. So, people talk about political will. During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action. Government cut through all the red tape, we got foreign vets on it. It was great. So, we can do it. But if you stroll down to the Yamuna or to the Gomati in Lucknow, or to the Adyar river in Chennai, or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune, just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.But I think the final note really is that we can do it. The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts, the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back. And the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders. And there is a gharial looking at us from the river. And these are powerful water totems. And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing. Namaste. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot. You know, most people are terrified of snakes. And there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust. Do you have those conversations with people? How do you really get them to care?Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach, I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly. It's not like the teddy bear. But I sort of \u2014 there is an innocence in these animals. And when the average person looks at a cobra going \"Ssssss!\" like that, they say, \"My god, look at that angry, dangerous creature.\" I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being. And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out. (Applause)CA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed. You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing. As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know? Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes, or even cobras. But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle. Whereas other king cobras very often come into the human interface, you know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff. This guy specializes in pit vipers. And the guy who is working there with them, he's from Maharashtra, he said, \"I think he's after the nusha.\" (Laughter) Now, the nusha means the high. Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush. (Laughter)CA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.

There is very high mortality\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nin little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nMy first experience with king cobras was in '72\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nat a magical place called Agumbe,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nin Karnataka, this state.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd it is a marvelous rain forest.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThis first encounter\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nwas kind of like the\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nMaasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIt really changed my life totally.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd it brought me straight into the conservation fray.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nI ended up starting this research\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nand education station in Agumbe,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nwhich you are all of course invited to visit.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThis is basically a base wherein\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nwe are trying to gather and learn\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nvirtually everything about the biodiversity\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nof this incredibly complex forest system,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand try to hang on to what's there,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nmake sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nand of course, having a good time too.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nYou can almost hear the drums\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthrobbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nIt was very important for us to get through to the people.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd through the children is usually the way to go.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThey are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nthat steely thing that you end up\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\neither fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThey are interested.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd it really works to start with them.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThis is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand was hanging around there for two or three days.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThe people of this part of India\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nworship the king cobra.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nNow we've caught more than 100 king cobras\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nover the last three years,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand relocated them in nearby forests.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nBut in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\n[it was necessary] for us to actually insert\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\na small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nNow we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nwhere the babies go after they hatch,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand remarkable things like this you're about to see.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThis was just a few days ago in Agumbe.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nI had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nwho had caught a venomous pit viper.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAnd it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd king cobras feed only on snakes.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThis [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nwhat we'd call a \"vadai\" or a donut or something like that.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nUsually they eat something a bit larger.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nIn this case a rather strange and inexplicable\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nactivity happened over the last breeding season,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nwherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\ndidn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nWe're still trying to explain and come to terms with\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwhat is the evolutionary advantage of this.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nBut they do also a lot of other remarkable things.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthat we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThis male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd they did this incredible ritual combat dance.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nIt's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nyou know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIt's just a wresting match,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nbut a remarkable activity.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nNow, what are we doing with all this information?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nWhat's the point of all this?\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWell, the king cobra is literally\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\na keystone species in these rainforests.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd our job is to convince the authorities\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthat these forests have to be protected.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd this is one of the ways we do it,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nby learning as much as we can\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nabout something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nin order to help protect trees, animals\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand of course the water sources.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nYou've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwhich started back in the early '70s,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhich was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWe were piloted, I could say,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nby a highly autocratic stateswoman,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbut who also had an incredible passion for environment.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd, just like Project Tiger,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nour activities with the king cobra\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nis to look at a species of animal\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nso that we protect its habitat and everything within it.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo, the tiger is the icon.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd now the king cobra is a new one.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAll the major rivers in south India\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nare sourced in the Western Ghats,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthe chain of hills running along the west coast of India.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nIt pours out millions of gallons every hour,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand washes many, many babies,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nand of course feeds many, many animals,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nboth domestic and wild,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nproduces thousands of tons of rice.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd what do we do? How do we respond to this?\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nWell, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwe pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nYou drink it in peril of your life.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd the thing is, it's not just big industry.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt's not misguided river engineers\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nwho are doing all this; it's us.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIt seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nare in water sources.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nOkay. Now we're going north, very far north.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nNorth central India, the Chambal River\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nis where we have our base.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThis is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nIt is an animal which has been on the Earth\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nfor just about 100 million years.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nIt survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt has remarkable features.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nEven though it grows to 20 feet long,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nsince it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nIt does have big teeth, however,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand it's kind of hard to convince people\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nif an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut we, actually, back in the early '70s,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\ndid surveys,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand found that gharial were extremely rare.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nIn fact, if you see the map,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthe range of their original habitat\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nwas all the way from the Indus in Pakistan\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nto the Irrawaddy in Burma.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd now it's just limited to a couple of spots\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin Nepal and India.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nSo, in fact at this point\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthere are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo, starting in the mid-'70s\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwhen conservation was at the fore,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nwe were actually able to start projects which were\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nbasically government supported\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nto collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand release 5,000 baby gharial\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nback to the wild.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nI mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nbasking on the river again.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nBut complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nlike sand mining, for example,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nvery, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nnot allowing the animals to breed anymore,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwe're looking at\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\neven more problems building up for the gharial,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ndespite the early good intentions.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nTheir nests hatching along the riverside\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nproducing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nThis was actually just taken last year.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nBut then the monsoon arrives,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nthere is always a barrage,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nand, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nLuckily there is still a lot of interest.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nMy pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthe [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthe World Wildlife Fund,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nthe Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nBut it's possibly, and definitely not enough.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nFor example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nthere was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSuddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nWhy? How could it happen?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThis is a relatively clean river.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nPeople scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nsomething you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nSo, in order to try to find out the answer to this,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nwe got veterinarians from all over the world\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nworking with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nI was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nAnd we actually looked through\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nall their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd it came down to something called gout,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nwhich, as a result of kidney breakdown\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nis actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nand worse in the joints,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nwhich made the gharial unable to swim.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd it's a horribly painful death.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nJust downriver from the Chambal is the\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nfilthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbut it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIt flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nand gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nwas something in the food chain,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nsomething in the fish they were eating.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\neverything is affected, including us.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBecause these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nIn order to try to answer some of these questions,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwe again turn to technology,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nto biological technology, in this case,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nagain, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand actually following their movements. They're being watched\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\neveryday as we speak, to try to find out\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nwhat this mysterious toxin is.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThe Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nIt's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nabout the bandits, the dacoits\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwho used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nBut Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nmade an incredible movie, \"The Bandit Queen,\" which I urge you to see.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nYou'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nBut, again, heavy fishing pressures.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThis is one of the last repositories of the\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nGanges river dolphin,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nvarious species of turtles,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthousands of migratory birds,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nand fishing is causing problems like this.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nAnd now [these] new elements of human intolerance\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nfor river creatures like the gharial\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nmeans that if they don't drown in the net,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthen they simply cut their beaks off.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nAnimals like the Ganges river dolphin\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwhich is just down to a few left,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nand it is also critically endangered.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nSo, who is next? Us?\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nBecause we are all dependent on these water sources.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nSo, we all know about the Narmada river,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthe tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nwhich displace people and wreck river systems\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwithout providing livelihoods.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd development just basically going berserk,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nfor a double figure growth index, basically.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nSo, we're not sure where this story is going to end,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwhether it's got a happy or sad ending.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nAnd climate change is certainly going\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nto turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nWe're still working hard at it.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nWe've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd the thing is, you know, the decision makers,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nthe folks in power,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nthey're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nin the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nBut out on the rivers there are still millions of people\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nwho are in really bad shape.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd it's a bleak future for them.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nSo, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWe've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand nothing to show for it. Incredible.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nSo, people talk about political will.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nDuring the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nGovernment cut through all the red tape,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nwe got foreign vets on it. It was great.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nSo, we can do it.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nBut if you stroll down to the Yamuna\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nor to the Gomati in Lucknow,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nor to the Adyar river in Chennai,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nor the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\njust see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nBut I think the final note really is\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat we can do it.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nThe corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nthe good old everyday folks\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\ncan actually bring these rivers back.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAnd the final word is\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nthat there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nAnd there is a gharial looking at us from the river.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nAnd these are powerful water totems.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nNamaste.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:32.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nChris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nYou know, most people are terrified of snakes.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nAnd there might be quite a few people here who would be\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nvery glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nDo you have those conversations with people?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nHow do you really get them to care?\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nRomulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nI guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nIt's not like the teddy bear.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nBut I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd when the average person looks at a cobra\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\ngoing \"Ssssss!\" like that, they say, \"My god,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nlook at that angry, dangerous creature.\"\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nI look at it as a creature who is totally frightened\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nof something so dangerous as a human being.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nCA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nYou were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nRW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nAs I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nUsually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nor even cobras.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nBut this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nWhereas other king cobras\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nvery often come into the human interface,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nyou know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nThis guy specializes in pit vipers.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd the guy who is working there with them,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nhe's from Maharashtra, he said, \"I think he's after the nusha.\"\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nNow, the nusha means the high.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nWhenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nCA: Thanks Rom.

For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears, these are the dancing bears. In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on. Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this. This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India, and have been in India since the 13th century.We went about getting evidence of what was going on. And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button. And we went in, pretending to be buyers. And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka. And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each, and they are used for bear paw soup, and also being trained, later on, to become dancing bears like the one you just saw.Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear. The couple are barely 18 years old. They already have four children beside them. You can see them. And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals. So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper, we found that it's an illegal act. These guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities. And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling. It was unacceptable. The mother bears are usually killed. The cubs, which are taken, are separated. Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod. And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood, to getting something else.So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment. And we were so unsure that this would work. We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him. And we said, \"Okay, here is some seed fund. Let's see if you can get something else.\" And we got the bear surrendered to \u2014 we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India. And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway. He has a telephone booth.And then it started, there was no turning back after that. This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear. And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near Agra. Then there was no looking back at all for us. We gave cycle rickshaws. We set up carpet-weaving units, vocational training for the women. The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.Education. The kids never went to school. They only had Islamic education, very little of it. And they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education. So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today. We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.Of course we also had to get the bears in. This is what happens to the bears when they come in. And this is what we turn them into. We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers. So, basically in 2002 there were 1,200 dancing bears. We rescued over 550 dancing bears. We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India, into our rescue center. (Applause) And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries. And the people can hold their heads up high. And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they've lived all their lives. And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again. And there will be no more removing of these bears. And the children, both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully. Thank you.

Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word. Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious. Inspiration is contagious. We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers. But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the \"I Can\" bug.So, the question is, why only them? In a country of a billion people and some, why so few? Is it luck? Is it chance? Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected? So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story. I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was. I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the \"I Can\" bug. And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real-world context, that if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of \"aware,\" where they can see the change, \"enable,\" be changed, and then \"empower,\" lead the change. And that directly increased student wellbeing. Children became more competent, and less helpless. But this was all common sense.So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer. It transformed them. What you will see is their journey, and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world. (Music)That's them rolling. And in two hours, after their backs were broke, they were changed. And once that happened, they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished. And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset. And that can't happen in a classroom. So, when Ragav experienced that he went from \"teacher told me,\" to \"I am doing it.\" And that's the \"I Can\" mindshift. And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.But we had parents who said, \"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English? Show us the grades.\" And we did. The data was conclusive. When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well, in fact very well, as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science.So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside. So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad. Now it was not about Riverside school. It was about all children. So, we were shameless. We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press, businesses, and basically said, \"When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child? When will you include the child in the city? Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child.\"So, how did the city respond? Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child, \"You can.\" A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad. Video: [Unclear] So, the busiest streets closed down. We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us. It gets taken over by children. They are skating. They are doing street plays. They are playing, all free, for all children. (Music)Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier. And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city. (Music)Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time. And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city. (Music)KBS: And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside. Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing. It was time now to infect India. So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, \"I can.\" How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools. We basically gave children a very simple challenge. We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives.And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India, from Nagaland in the east, to Jhunjhunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south. Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems. Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan. I mean, it was incredible. Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, \"You can,\" then they will. Infection in India. This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write. KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school \u2014 unheard of \u2014 to tell their parents why literacy is important. Look at what their parents says.Man: This program is wonderful. We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign. In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities. See? They have done it.KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad. Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...We have to start collecting from 555.KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out, pretty difficult, but they did it.Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work. First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them.Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause, the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids. Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes! Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes! Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here. Street plays, auctions, petitions. I mean, they were changing lives. It was incredible. So, how can we still stay immune? How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement? I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji. 70 years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of \"We can.\"So, today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India? Last I heard, the preamble still said, \"We, the people of India,\" right? So, if not us, then who? If not now, then when? Like I said, contagious is a good word. Thank you.

Passion is contagious.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nInspiration is contagious.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nWe've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nBut for me, what was contagious about all of them\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nwas that they were infected by something I call the\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\n\"I Can\" bug.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nSo, the question is, why only them?\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nIn a country of a billion people and some,\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nwhy so few?\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nIs it luck? Is it chance?\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nCan we all not systematically and consciously\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nget infected?\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSo, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nI got infected when I was 17,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nwhen, as a student of the design college,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nI encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nchallenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nAnd I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand how contagious that feeling was.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nI also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSo, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\na lab to prototype and refine a design process\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nthat could consciously infect the mind with the \"I Can\" bug.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd I uncovered\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nthat if learning is embedded in real-world context,\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthat if you blur the boundaries between school and life,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthen children go through a journey of \"aware,\"\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nwhere they can see the change,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\n\"enable,\" be changed,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand then \"empower,\" lead the change.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd that directly increased student wellbeing.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nChildren became more competent,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand less helpless.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nBut this was all common sense.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nSo, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\ncommon practice looks like at Riverside.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nA little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nthey were made to roll incense sticks,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nagarbattis, for eight hours\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nto experience what it means to be a child laborer.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nIt transformed them. What you will see is their journey,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand then their utter conviction\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthat they could go out and change the world.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\n(Music)\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThat's them rolling.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd in two hours, after their backs were broke,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthey were changed.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd once that happened,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthey were out in the city convincing everybody\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthat child labor just had to be abolished.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nAnd look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nbecause he's been able to understand that he\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nhas shifted that man's mindset.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd that can't happen in a classroom.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nSo, when Ragav experienced that\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nhe went from \"teacher told me,\"\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nto \"I am doing it.\" And that's the \"I Can\" mindshift.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nAnd it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nBut we had parents who said,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n\"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nbut what about math and science and English?\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nShow us the grades.\"\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd we did. The data was conclusive.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWhen children are empowered,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nnot only do they do good,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthey do well, in fact very well,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nas you can see in this national benchmarking assessment\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\ntaken by over 2,000 schools in India,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nRiverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nin math, English and science.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nSo, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthe children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nNow it was not about Riverside school.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nIt was about all children. So, we were shameless.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthe press, businesses,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand basically said, \"When are you going to wake up\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand recognize the potential that resides in every child?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nWhen will you include the child in the city?\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nBasically, open your hearts and your minds to the child.\"\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nSo, how did the city respond?\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSince 2007 every other month\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthe city closes down the busiest streets for traffic\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nand converts it into a playground for children and childhood.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nHere was a city telling its child, \"You can.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nA glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nVideo: [Unclear]\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo, the busiest streets closed down.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nWe have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nIt gets taken over by children.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThey are skating. They are doing street plays.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThey are playing, all free, for all children.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Music)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAtul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nAnd we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\n(Music)\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nKiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nAnd Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nGeet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nin the future the children will give back to the city.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n(Music)\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nKBS: And because of that,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAhmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThen 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt was time now to infect India.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, on August 15th,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nagain, Independence Day, 2009,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nempowered with the same process,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nwe empowered 100,000 children to say, \"I can.\"\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nHow? We designed a simple toolkit,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nconverted it into eight languages,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand reached 32,000 schools.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nWe basically gave children a very simple challenge.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nWe said, take one idea,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nanything that bothers you,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nchoose one week,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand change a billion lives.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd they did.

Millions of people were in severe need of help. The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area. But there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail. The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having detailed maps.But help was coming. At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points. And it took them four days. The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally. People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and video stores to the corner store.Maps matter. Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land. For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable. And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere.Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now. So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries. You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal. And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning. This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of cities, one user, one edit at a time.This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet. Welcome to the new world.

Obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it. (Laughter) Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing. (Laughter) And when you use these things you don't have to go like that. You just press it. (Laughter) Oh, man. Um, yes. (Laughter) Yes. I'm sure! Just change it! (Laughter) Is Bill Gates here? Change it! Come on! What? (Laughter) Ah! Okay. That's not my slides, but it's okay. (Laughter)As you can see, these are all maps. And maps are important devices for transferring information, especially if you have human cognitive ability. We can see that all formulas are really maps. Now, as humans, we make maps of places that we seldom even go, which seems a little wasteful of time.This, of course, is a map of the moon. There're some very delightful names. Tranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris. What are these people thinking? Frigoris? What the Frigoris you doing? Names are important. Frigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day. I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so. (Laughter)There we see Mars, again with various names. And this is all done, by the way, by the International Astronomical Union. This is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects. This is from their actual book. These are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa. That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid. (Laughter) Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel. (Laughter) \"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy! It's time for Bolotnitsa!\" (Laughter)Djabran Fluctus. If that don't flow off the tongue, what does? (Laughter) I mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word \"fluctus\" up there. That's wrong. (Laughter) One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life. (Laughter) \"It fluctus up, Mama.\"Hikuleo Fluctus. That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio 17 syllable thing. And that's the Tonga underworld.And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus, who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets. Now, if you're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else? (Laughter) \"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars. Would you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling. Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care. Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures.\" (Laughter)Now, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do, it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names. So, you'll be on Mars, and you're at Hellespointica Depressio which has got to be a really \"up\" place. (Laughter)Yeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map, and click the button and there's my directions. I go to Chrysokeras. (Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata. Then to Niliacus Lacus, which is not a bad name. Niliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus. That's a cool name. I will say that. So, I hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers.And then of course Arnon to Thoth. And of course there will be advertisements. This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union. And you know they're international because they put it \"en Francais\" as well. L'Union Astronomique Internationale, for those of you who don't speak French. I thought I'd translate for you.From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool. The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous. And I think that Djabran Fluctus, that fits that mode. (Laughter) That's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple. Djabran Fluctus. \"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?\" \"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian? (Laughter) It's clear to me.\" \"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?\" (Laughter)Also, from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest. Anyone can suggest changing a name. So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community. We've got to change this stuff up fast. So, these are actual names of people that work there. I did some more investigation. These are more people working for this group. And, as you can see, they don't use their first names. (Laughter) These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names. Something is askew here. (Laughter) Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck? (Laughter) Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba? (Laughter) Is that Mars Ya Marov? I don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.There are some mapping people who do use their names. Witness please, Eugene Shoemaker, who, diligently, from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies. Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house. \"Mom, I want to make maps.\" \"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto.\" \"No, I want to make maps of planets.\" \"Yeah, go to your room.\" (Laughter)Martians, Venusians, Jovians. We have names for places where people don't exist. That seems a little silly to me. There are no Jovians.Getting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way, because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights. (Laughter) (Applause) There is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr, de Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn or Richard Harris. (Laughter) It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.But obviously the point is that numbers are maps. And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe? That is the premise of this particular presentation. By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn, no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful. So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet, and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.So, formulas relate number to form. That's Euler, his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool. (Laughter) He was also famous for having no body. (Laughter) Which a lot of you are like, \"How did he figure that out?\" He's got no body, no man, just a head floating high. Here comes Euler. (Laughter)And that's an icosahedron, which is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes. You see the icosahedron again. The dodecahedron, it's dual. There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night. The five sacred solids, as you can see there. Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads. (Laughter) Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house. I suggest the house.The reality, now here is something important. What's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other. And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other. So, the whole concept of branes in the universe, if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be. And that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.What a coincidence! October 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron, based on information that they got from this probe. This would be a normal wave pattern. But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background, is this kind of odd undulation. It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.So, you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture, so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like. And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger. (Laughter) So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger. And for me, that's a win-win. Everybody goes, I'm happy. (Laughter) Better really hurry up.I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are, without heart and without love it's just \u2014 it's all meaningless. And that, to me, is really beautiful. (Laughter) Except for that creepy guy in the background. (Laughter)Getting back to the point of my particular presentation, Kepler, one of my great heroes, who realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier, were related somehow to the planets, but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out. But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity. So, maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge.Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp. (Laughter) I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ... (Laughter) that's not a good picture. (Laughter) Not a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis are a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton. That guy is rockin'. (Laughter) What a handsome cat.Once again, Nicaragua let me down. (Laughter) And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird. (Laughter) I don't get that at all. Once again, these guys rock it out. Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star. This is freaky is a major way. This is Sierra Leone. They got little babies in there, floating in there. (Laughter)Man. I don't really need to comment on this. But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you? (Laughter) When did this happen? (Laughter) It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples? I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid. Although five is a good number, of course.Ecuador, my friend Kepler, as you can see, they call him Juan. (Laughter) Juan? No! Johannes, not Juan. It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong. (Laughter)Ren\u00e9 Descartes, of course. Once again these Grenada people, this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination. He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg, little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up fast, ladies and gentlemen. (Laughter)This is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates. Once again, that's Sierra Leone. This is again, indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form, maps of the universe. Because that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.Descartes. (Laughter) Before the horse. (Laughter) Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around. Now, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why. Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it. (Laughter) And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map I don't even want to hazard a guess. But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently. (Laughter)This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen, the flag of Indonesia. Please examine. (Laughter) (Applause) Not sure how this came to be, but it's not right. In Monaco, \"No, what are you talking about? They are so different. Look, ours is more red, it's longer. They stole our flag! They stole our flag!\" (Laughter)Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus. And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work. That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work. (Laughter) Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.And I wonder if the photographer said, \"Okay, Jude, could you touch your tooth? That's good.\" Just a tip, if you're being photographed for press pictures, don't touch your teeth. (Laughter)Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites. Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born. I know that scares a lot of you, but that was my purpose entirely. There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section, because Fibonacci and Golden Section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it. If Fibonacci had been on Paxil, (Laughter) that would be the Fibonacci series. \"Ten milligram, 20 milligram.\" \"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills.\" \"Yes, Mama.\" (Laughter)Alright where is this going? That's a good question. Here is the premise that I began 27 years ago. If numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live, I reason, through some sort of reverse engineering, we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe. And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago I started working on this.And I tried to build a particle accelerator. (Laughter) And that didn't work out well. So, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor. I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing. That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds. Moleeds are what I believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved. They are the nodes on the string, patterns and relationships, 27, 37. That was the first chart I came up with.You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers, the beauty of the symmetry. The numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups. Symmetry, pairs. Every top adds up to 37. Bottom, all 74. There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now, because you would say, \"Hey, go back to the Fluctus part.\" (Laughter)Circle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry. I knew those two were related. Once again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over. So, I said if I'm going to put a circle, see what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System. Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen. (Laughter) You can't just go around going, \"Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up, and it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out.\"This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. There is the Orange System. (Laughter) And you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27. And they recapitulate that shape, even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts. (Laughter) That's the Green System. It all folds in half on the Green System, right between 18 and 19. The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there. (Laughter) Look at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up. (Laughter) That just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen. Twenty-seven years of my life! (Laughter) And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why? Because this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here. (Laughter) \"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not.\" (Laughter)In this last year I have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the Calabi-Yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions. Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me. It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden. I don't want hidden, I want to see it. (Laughter)I found other pairs all have symmetry, even though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split. Unbelievable. This is like crazy. Am I the only one that sees this? (Laughter) You know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way. You know, try making some charts like this at home. You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments. These are maps, by the way. Not stamps, but one day. (Laughter)Okay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy. And look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio. I start looking at that, and look at them again. They start looking like planets. I go to JPL. I look at the orbits of the planets. I find 18 examples of it in our solar system. I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history. (Laughter) Kepler was right. (Laughter) Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section. Multiply them together, 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247. Which is .005 different from the number of days in a year.Hey, you can't make this up. (Laughter) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you.

I'm not really clear which one.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut obviously the point is that numbers are maps.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThat is the premise of this particular presentation.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nBy the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nno adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nSo beautiful that I will even give up a laugh\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nto explain my love of this particular planet,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, formulas relate number to form.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThat's Euler, his formula\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nwas one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nwhich is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nHe was also famous for having no body.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhich a lot of you are like, \"How did he figure that out?\"\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nHe's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nHere comes Euler.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd that's an icosahedron,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nwhich is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou see the icosahedron again.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThe dodecahedron, it's dual.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThere is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThe five sacred solids, as you can see there.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nWhich is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBlue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nI suggest the house.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nThe reality, now here is something important.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWhat's important about this is\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthese shapes are duals of each other.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd you can see how the icosahedron\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nwithdraws into the dodecahedron\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nand then they just merge into each other.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nSo, the whole concept of branes in the universe,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nif the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthis is a very good map of what could possibly be.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nWhat a coincidence!\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nOctober 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nsaid that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nbased on information that they got from this probe.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThis would be a normal wave pattern.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nBut what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nof the microwave background,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nis this kind of odd undulation.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nIt doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo, you can kind of get an idea from this\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nextrapolating that back under this huge picture,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nso we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd for me, that's a win-win.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nEverybody goes, I'm happy.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nBetter really hurry up.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nI just threw this in because\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nas important as all of our intellectual abilities are,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwithout heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd that, to me, is really beautiful.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nExcept for that creepy guy in the background.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nGetting back to the point of my particular presentation,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nKepler, one of my great heroes,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwho realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nwere related somehow to the planets,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nbut he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nBut it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo, maps of things leading to organized understandings\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof the universe in which we emerge.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nNow this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nI am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\ncould maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthat's not a good picture.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nNot a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nare a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nThat guy is rockin'.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nWhat a handsome cat.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nOnce again, Nicaragua let me down.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nI don't get that at all.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nOnce again, these guys rock it out.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nIsaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThis is freaky is a major way.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nThis is Sierra Leone.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey got little babies in there, floating in there.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nMan. I don't really need to comment on this.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nBut I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWhen did this happen?\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nIt's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI mean these guys are extrapolating in realms\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthat are not necessarily valid.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAlthough five is a good number, of course.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nEcuador, my friend Kepler,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nas you can see, they call him Juan.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nJuan? No! Johannes, not Juan.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIt wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nRen\u00e9 Descartes, of course. Once again\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nthese Grenada people, this is like way too sick\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfor anybody's imagination.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nHe's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nlittle ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nfast, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nThis is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nOnce again, that's Sierra Leone.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThis is again, indicating how numbers\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nrelate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nBecause that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nDescartes. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nBefore the horse. (Laughter)\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nNow, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nNow, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nHere is a map. All they have is a casino on it.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nAnd why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nI don't even want to hazard a guess.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBut I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThis is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthe flag of Indonesia. Please examine.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nNot sure how this came to be, but it's not right.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nIn Monaco, \"No, what are you talking about?\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThey are so different.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nLook, ours is more red, it's longer.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThey stole our flag! They stole our flag!\"\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nBode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThat's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nJust a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nAnd I wonder if the photographer said, \"Okay, Jude,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\ncould you touch your tooth? That's good.\"\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nJust a tip, if you're being photographed\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nfor press pictures, don't touch your teeth.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nPrime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nGolden section, I've been obsessed with this thing\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nsince before I was born.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nI know that scares a lot of you,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbut that was my purpose entirely.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThere we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbecause Fibonacci and Golden Section\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nrelate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nIf Fibonacci had been on Paxil,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthat would be the Fibonacci series.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n\"Ten milligram, 20 milligram.\"\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\n\"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills.\"\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n\"Yes, Mama.\"\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nAlright where is this going? That's a good question.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nHere is the premise that I began 27 years ago.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nIf numbers can express\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nthe laws of this incredible universe that we live,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nI reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nwe could extrapolate from them\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nsome basic structural element of this universe.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nAnd that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nI started working on this.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd I tried to build a particle accelerator.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nAnd that didn't work out well.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nSo, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThat's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nMoleeds are what I believe\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthe thing that will allow string theory to be proved.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nThey are the nodes on the string,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\npatterns and relationships, 27, 37.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nThat was the first chart I came up with.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nYou can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthe beauty of the symmetry.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThe numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nSymmetry, pairs.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nEvery top adds up to 37.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nBottom, all 74.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThere is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nbecause you would say, \"Hey, go back to the Fluctus part.\"\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nCircle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nI knew those two were related.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nOnce again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSo, I said if I'm going to put a circle,\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nsee what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nLook at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nYou can't just go around going, \"Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nand they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out.\"\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nThis is beyond anything anybody could just make up.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nThere is the Orange System.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nAnd they recapitulate that shape,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\neven though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:27.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThat's the Green System. It all folds in half\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\non the Green System, right between 18 and 19.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nThe Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nLook at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nThat just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nTwenty-seven years of my life!\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nAnd I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nBecause this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\n\"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not.\"\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nIn this last year I have found these subsequent systems\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nwhich allow for the mathematic possibilities\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nof the Calabi-Yau manifolds\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nin a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nWhich works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nIt just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nI don't want hidden, I want to see it.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nI found other pairs all have symmetry,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\neven though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nUnbelievable. This is like crazy.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nAm I the only one that sees this?\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nYou know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nYou know, try making some charts like this at home.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nYou gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThese are maps, by the way.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nNot stamps, but one day.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nOkay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nAnd look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nI start looking at that, and look at them again.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nThey start looking like planets.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nI go to JPL.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nI look at the orbits of the planets.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nI find 18 examples of it in our solar system.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nI never told anybody.

I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible. I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin, buried alive in a coffin in April, 1999, for a week. I lived there with nothing but water. And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things. The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City. That one was way more difficult than I had expected. The one after that, I stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar for 36 hours. I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads.So, next I went to London. In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water. It was, for me, one of the most difficult things I'd ever done, but it was also the most beautiful. There was so many skeptics, especially the press in London, that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me.(Laughter)So, I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science.My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing, like how long I could survive with nothing, not even air. I didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life.As a young magician, I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges. So, I began, early on, competing against the other kids, seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe, you know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath. By the time I was a teenager, I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds. I would later find out that was Houdini's personal record.In 1987 I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river. He was underneath, not breathing for 45 minutes. When the rescue workers came, they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage. His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees. As a magician, I think everything is possible. And I think if something is done by one person, it can be done by others. I started to think, if the boy could survive without breathing for that long, there must be a way that I could do it.So, I met with a top neurosurgeon. And I asked him, how long is it possible to go without breathing, like how long could I go without air? And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage. So, I took that as a challenge, basically.(Laughter)My first try, I figured that I could do something similar, and I created a water tank, and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water. And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop. And I was shivering. In my first attempt to hold my breath, I couldn't even last a minute. So, I realized that was completely not going to work.I went to talk to a doctor friend \u2014 and I asked him, \"How could I do that?\" \"I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done?\" And he said, \"David, you're a magician, create the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier.\"(Laughter)So, he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather, with a CO2 scrubber, which was basically a tube from Home Depot, with a balloon duct-taped to it, that he thought we could put inside of me, and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me. This is a little hard to watch. But this is that attempt. So, that clearly wasn't going to work.(Laughter)Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing. There is a chemical that's called perflubron. And it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it. So, I got my hands on that chemical, filled the sink up with it, and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in, which was really impossible. It's basically like trying to breathe, as a doctor said, while having an elephant standing on your chest. So, that idea disappeared.Then I started thinking, would it be possible to hook up a heart/lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery, and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood? Which was another insane idea, obviously.Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas: to actually do it.(Laughter)To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead. So, I started researching into pearl divers. You know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath. And when I was researching pearl divers, I found the world of free-diving. It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered, pretty much. There is many different aspects to free-diving. There is depth records, where people go as deep as they can. And then there is static apnea. That's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving. That was the one that I studied.The first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath, you should never move at all; that wastes energy. And that depletes oxygen, and it builds up CO2 in your blood. So, I learned never to move. And I learned how to slow my heart rate down. I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn't in my body, and just control that. And then I learned how to purge. Purging is basically hyperventilating. You blow in and out \u2014(Breathing loudly)You do that, you get lightheaded, you get tingling. And you're really ridding your body of CO2. So, when you hold your breath, it's infinitely easier. Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath, and just hold and relax and never let any air out, and just hold and relax through all the pain.Every morning, this is for months, I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for, out of 52 minutes, I would hold my breath for 44 minutes. So, basically what that means is I would purge, I'd breathe really hard for a minute. And I would hold, immediately after, for five and a half minutes. Then I would breathe again for a minute, purging as hard as I can, then immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes. I would repeat this process eight times in a row. Out of 52 minutes, you're only breathing for eight minutes. At the end of that you're completely fried, your brain. You feel like you're walking around in a daze. And you have these awful headaches. Basically, I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.I started learning about the world-record holder. His name is Tom Sietas. And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath. He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds. And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person. I'm six foot one, and fat. We'll say big-boned.(Laughter)I had to drop 50 pounds in three months. So, everything that I put into my body, I considered as medicine. Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value. I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day. And I started to really adapt my body.[Individual results may vary](Laughter)The thinner I was, the longer I was able to hold my breath. And by eating so well and training so hard, my resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute. Which is lower than most Olympic athletes. In four months of training, I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes. I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere. I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress.(Laughter)I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime-time television. The world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds, held by Tom Sietas, that guy with the whale lungs I told you about. I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center and if I stayed there a week not eating, I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism, which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it. I was completely wrong.I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date. And I thought everything seemed to be on track. Two days before my big breath-hold attempt, for the record, the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath, and almost drowning, is too boring for television.(Laughter)So, I had to add handcuffs, while holding my breath, to escape from. This was a critical mistake. Because of the movement, I was wasting oxygen. And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions. By 7:08, I started to black out. And by seven minutes and 30 seconds, they had to pull my body out and bring me back. I had failed on every level.(Laughter)So, naturally, the only way out of the slump that I could think of was, I decided to call Oprah.(Laughter)I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had. This was a different record. This was a pure O2 static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes. So, basically you breathe pure O2 first, oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2, and you are able to hold much longer. I realized that my real competition was the beaver.(Laughter)(Laughter ends)In January of '08, Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train. So, I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night. A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet. So, it's like base camp, Everest. What that does is, you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body, which helps you carry oxygen better. Every morning, again, after getting out of that tent, your brain is completely wiped out. My first attempt on pure O2, I was able to go up to 15 minutes. So, it was a pretty big success.The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind, at 15 minutes your brain is done, you're brain dead. So, he pulled me up, and I was fine. There was one person there that was definitely not impressed. It was my ex-girlfriend. While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time, she was sifting through my Blackberry, checking all my messages.(Laughter)My brother had a picture of it. It is really \u2014(Laughter)(Laughter ends)I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record, publicly. And what he did in response, is he went on Regis and Kelly, and broke his old record. Then his main competitor went out and broke his record. So, he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds. Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared. It was longer than the record.I wanted to get the Science Times to document this. I wanted to get them to do a piece on it. So, I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do. I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody.(Laughter)So, I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands, but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding.While he was there, I tried to impress him, of course. And I did a dive down to 160 feet, which is basically the height of a 16 story building, and as I was coming up, I blacked out underwater, which is really dangerous; that's how you drown. Luckily, Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up.So, I started full focus. I completely trained to get my breath-hold time up for what I needed to do. But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it, being on Oprah. But in practice, I would do it face down, floating on the pool. But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face, basically. The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up. So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose, which was a real problem for me. That made me extremely nervous, raising the heart rate.Then, what they also did was, which we never did before, is there was a heart-rate monitor. And it was right next to the sphere. So, every time my heart would beat, I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep, you know, the ticking, really loud. Which was making me more nervous. And there was no way to slow my heart rate down. Normally, I would start at 38 beats per minute, and while holding my breath, it would drop to 12 beats per minute, which is pretty unusual.(Laughter)This time it started at 120 beats, and it never went down. I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down. I was just sitting there thinking, \"I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail.\" And I was getting more nervous. And the heart rate just kept going up and up, all the way up to 150 beats. Basically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center. It was a waste of O2. When I made it to the halfway mark, at eight minutes, I was 100 percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this. There was no way for me to do it.I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath-hold thing, if I had cracked early, it would be a whole show about how depressed I am.(Laughter)So, I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out, at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.(Laughter)I kept pushing to 10 minutes. At 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes. And I knew that that was blood shunting, when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs. At 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs, and my lips started to feel really strange.At minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears, and I started to feel my arm going numb. And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember arm numb means heart attack. So, I started to really get really paranoid. Then at 13 minutes, maybe because of the hypochondria, I started feeling pains all over my chest. It was awful.(Laughter)At 14 minutes, I had these awful contractions, like this urge to breathe.(Laughter)(Laughter ends)At 15 minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart. And I started having ischemia to the heart. My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50, to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again. It would skip a beat. It would start. It would stop. And I felt all this. And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.So, at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out, if I did have a heart attack, they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up. I was really nervous. I let my feet out, and I started floating to the top. And I didn't take my head out. But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop, just waiting.They had doctors with the \"Pst,\" you know, sitting there waiting. And then suddenly I hear screaming. And I think that there is some weird thing \u2014 that I had died or something had happened. And then I realized that I had made it to 16:32. So, with the energy of everybody that was there, I decided to keep pushing. And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.(Applause)(Applause ends)As though that wasn't enough, what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were, so the doctors could use it, once again. I also didn't want anybody to question it. I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate.So, I get to New York City the next day, I'm walking out of the Apple store, and this kid walks up to me he's like, \"Yo, D!\" I'm like \"Yeah?\" He said, \"If you really held your breath that long, why'd you come out of the water dry?\" I was like \"What?\"(Laughter)And that's my life. So \u2014(Laughter)As a magician, I try to show things to people that seem impossible. And I think magic, whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards, is pretty simple. It's practice, it's training, and it's \u2014 (Sobs) It's practice, it's training and experimenting,(Sobs)while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be. And that's what magic is to me, so, thank you.(Applause)", "id": 741, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:17.029\nAs a magician, I try to create images\nthat make people stop and think.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.934\nI also try to challenge myself\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.934\nto do things that doctors\nsay are not possible.\n\n00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.934\nI was buried alive\nin New York City in a coffin,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.811\nburied alive in a coffin\nin April, 1999, for a week.\n\n00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:37.081\nI lived there with nothing but water.\n\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.934\nAnd it ended up being so much fun\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.934\nthat I decided I could pursue\ndoing more of these things.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.390\nThe next one is I froze myself\nin a block of ice\n\n00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.934\nfor three days and three nights\nin New York City.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.655\nThat one was way more difficult\nthan I had expected.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.934\nThe one after that, I stood\non top of a hundred-foot pillar\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.934\nfor 36 hours.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.457\nI began to hallucinate so hard\n\n00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:07.184\nthat the buildings that were behind me\nstarted to look like big animal heads.\n\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.934\nSo, next I went to London.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.934\nIn London I lived\nin a glass box for 44 days\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.934\nwith nothing but water.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nIt was, for me, one of the most difficult\nthings I'd ever done,\n\n00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:22.065\nbut it was also the most beautiful.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.934\nThere was so many skeptics,\nespecially the press in London,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:31.934\nthat they started flying cheeseburgers\non helicopters around my box to tempt me.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:32.989\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:35.934\nSo, I felt very validated\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.937\nwhen the New England Journal of Medicine\nactually used the research for science.\n\n00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:45.934\nMy next pursuit was I wanted to see\nhow long I could go without breathing,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.375\nlike how long I could survive\nwith nothing, not even air.\n\n00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:54.182\nI didn't realize that it would become\nthe most amazing journey of my life.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.934\nAs a young magician,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.934\nI was obsessed with Houdini\nand his underwater challenges.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.934\nSo, I began, early on,\ncompeting against the other kids,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.934\nseeing how long I could stay underwater\nwhile they went up and down to breathe,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.934\nyou know, five times,\nwhile I stayed under on one breath.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.934\nBy the time I was a teenager,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.934\nI was able to hold my breath\nfor three minutes and 30 seconds.\n\n00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:21.817\nI would later find out\nthat was Houdini's personal record.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.934\nIn 1987 I heard of a story\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.934\nabout a boy that fell through ice\nand was trapped under a river.\n\n00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:37.934\nHe was underneath,\nnot breathing for 45 minutes.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.934\nWhen the rescue workers came,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.934\nthey resuscitated him\nand there was no brain damage.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:47.261\nHis core temperature\nhad dropped to 77 degrees.\n\n00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:50.934\nAs a magician,\nI think everything is possible.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.149\nAnd I think if something\nis done by one person,\n\n00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.662\nit can be done by others.\n\n00:02:55.686 --> 00:02:57.068\nI started to think,\n\n00:02:57.092 --> 00:03:00.800\nif the boy could survive\nwithout breathing for that long,\n\n00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:02.688\nthere must be a way that I could do it.\n\n00:03:03.548 --> 00:03:05.934\nSo, I met with a top neurosurgeon.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:09.172\nAnd I asked him, how long\nis it possible to go without breathing,\n\n00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:11.576\nlike how long could I go without air?\n\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.934\nAnd he said to me that anything\nover six minutes\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.168\nyou have a serious risk\nof hypoxic brain damage.\n\n00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:22.808\nSo, I took that as a challenge, basically.\n\n00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:30.485\nMy first try, I figured\nthat I could do something similar,\n\n00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:32.934\nand I created a water tank,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.502\nand I filled it with ice\nand freezing cold water.\n\n00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:38.934\nAnd I stayed inside of that water tank\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.934\nhoping my core temperature\nwould start to drop.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.361\nAnd I was shivering.\n\n00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:46.878\nIn my first attempt to hold my breath,\nI couldn't even last a minute.\n\n00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:49.416\nSo, I realized that was completely\nnot going to work.\n\n00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.878\nI went to talk to a doctor friend --\n\n00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:59.934\nand I asked him, \"How could I do that?\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.387\n\"I want to hold my breath for a really\nlong time. How could it be done?\"\n\n00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.934\nAnd he said, \"David, you're a magician,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.934\ncreate the illusion of not breathing,\nit will be much easier.\"\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.611\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:16.934\nSo, he came up with this idea\nof creating a rebreather,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.579\nwith a CO2 scrubber,\n\n00:04:19.603 --> 00:04:23.934\nwhich was basically\na tube from Home Depot,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.934\nwith a balloon duct-taped to it,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.934\nthat he thought we could put inside of me,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.934\nand somehow be able to circulate\nthe air and rebreathe\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.524\nwith this thing in me.\n\n00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.934\nThis is a little hard to watch.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.985\nBut this is that attempt.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.934\nSo, that clearly wasn't going to work.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.102\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.934\nThen I actually started thinking\nabout liquid breathing.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.934\nThere is a chemical\nthat's called perflubron.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.934\nAnd it's so high in oxygen levels\nthat in theory you could breathe it.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.934\nSo, I got my hands on that chemical,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.934\nfilled the sink up with it,\nand stuck my face in the sink\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.934\nand tried to breathe that in,\nwhich was really impossible.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.934\nIt's basically like trying\nto breathe, as a doctor said,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.244\nwhile having an elephant\nstanding on your chest.\n\n00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:23.401\nSo, that idea disappeared.\n\n00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:25.671\nThen I started thinking,\n\n00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:29.934\nwould it be possible to hook up\na heart/lung bypass machine\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.934\nand have a surgery where it was\na tube going into my artery,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.461\nand then appear to not breathe\nwhile they were oxygenating my blood?\n\n00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.469\nWhich was another insane idea, obviously.\n\n00:05:41.588 --> 00:05:45.097\nThen I thought about\nthe craziest idea of all the ideas:\n\n00:05:46.485 --> 00:05:47.934\nto actually do it.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.005\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.441\nTo actually try to hold\nmy breath past the point\n\n00:05:52.465 --> 00:05:55.396\nthat doctors would\nconsider you brain dead.\n\n00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:01.934\nSo, I started researching\ninto pearl divers.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.934\nYou know, because they go down\nfor four minutes on one breath.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.534\nAnd when I was researching pearl divers,\nI found the world of free-diving.\n\n00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:13.438\nIt was the most amazing thing\nthat I ever discovered, pretty much.\n\n00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:16.934\nThere is many different\naspects to free-diving.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.482\nThere is depth records,\nwhere people go as deep as they can.\n\n00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:22.406\nAnd then there is static apnea.\n\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.934\nThat's holding your breath\nas long as you can\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.934\nin one place without moving.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.934\nThat was the one that I studied.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.054\nThe first thing that I learned\nis when you're holding your breath,\n\n00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:34.934\nyou should never move at all;\nthat wastes energy.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.597\nAnd that depletes oxygen,\n\n00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:39.460\nand it builds up CO2 in your blood.\n\n00:06:39.484 --> 00:06:41.352\nSo, I learned never to move.\n\n00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:43.934\nAnd I learned how to slow\nmy heart rate down.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.149\nI had to remain\nperfectly still and just relax\n\n00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:49.934\nand think that I wasn't in my body,\nand just control that.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.934\nAnd then I learned how to purge.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.411\nPurging is basically hyperventilating.\n\n00:06:54.435 --> 00:06:55.627\nYou blow in and out --\n\n00:06:55.651 --> 00:06:59.934\n(Breathing loudly)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.935\nYou do that, you get lightheaded,\nyou get tingling.\n\n00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:05.264\nAnd you're really ridding\nyour body of CO2.\n\n00:07:05.288 --> 00:07:08.541\nSo, when you hold your breath,\nit's infinitely easier.\n\n00:07:09.374 --> 00:07:12.977\nThen I learned that you have\nto take a huge breath,\n\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.934\nand just hold and relax\nand never let any air out,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.453\nand just hold and relax\nthrough all the pain.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.523\nEvery morning, this is for months,\n\n00:07:22.547 --> 00:07:25.387\nI would wake up\nand the first thing that I would do\n\n00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.744\nis I would hold my breath\n\n00:07:27.784 --> 00:07:32.934\nfor, out of 52 minutes,\nI would hold my breath for 44 minutes.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.149\nSo, basically what that means\nis I would purge,\n\n00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:37.034\nI'd breathe really hard for a minute.\n\n00:07:37.058 --> 00:07:40.327\nAnd I would hold, immediately after,\nfor five and a half minutes.\n\n00:07:40.351 --> 00:07:43.934\nThen I would breathe again for a minute,\npurging as hard as I can,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.535\nthen immediately after that I would hold\nagain for five and a half minutes.\n\n00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:50.470\nI would repeat this process\neight times in a row.\n\n00:07:50.494 --> 00:07:53.934\nOut of 52 minutes, you're only\nbreathing for eight minutes.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.934\nAt the end of that\nyou're completely fried, your brain.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.149\nYou feel like you're walking\naround in a daze.\n\n00:07:59.173 --> 00:08:00.934\nAnd you have these awful headaches.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.934\nBasically, I'm not the best person\nto talk to when I'm doing that stuff.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.292\nI started learning\nabout the world-record holder.\n\n00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:08.934\nHis name is Tom Sietas.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.934\nAnd this guy is perfectly built\nfor holding his breath.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.934\nHe's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.934\nAnd his total lung capacity\nis twice the size of an average person.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.445\nI'm six foot one, and fat.\n\n00:08:25.535 --> 00:08:26.934\nWe'll say big-boned.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.934\nI had to drop 50 pounds in three months.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:37.468\nSo, everything that I put into my body,\nI considered as medicine.\n\n00:08:37.492 --> 00:08:41.934\nEvery bit of food was exactly\nwhat it was for its nutritional value.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.934\nI ate really small controlled portions\nthroughout the day.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.155\nAnd I started to really adapt my body.\n\n00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:52.321\n[Individual results may vary]\n\n00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:54.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.583\nThe thinner I was, the longer\nI was able to hold my breath.\n\n00:08:58.607 --> 00:09:01.934\nAnd by eating so well\nand training so hard,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.458\nmy resting heart-rate dropped\nto 38 beats per minute.\n\n00:09:05.482 --> 00:09:07.686\nWhich is lower than most Olympic athletes.\n\n00:09:08.999 --> 00:09:10.549\nIn four months of training,\n\n00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:13.046\nI was able to hold my breath\nfor over seven minutes.\n\n00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:16.934\nI wanted to try holding\nmy breath everywhere.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.292\nI wanted to try it\nin the most extreme situations\n\n00:09:19.316 --> 00:09:23.611\nto see if I could slow\nmy heart rate down under duress.\n\n00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:26.078\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.934\nI decided that I was going\nto break the world record\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.535\nlive on prime-time television.\n\n00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:35.934\nThe world record was\neight minutes and 58 seconds,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:39.149\nheld by Tom Sietas, that guy\nwith the whale lungs I told you about.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.371\nI assumed that I could put\na water tank at Lincoln Center\n\n00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:47.934\nand if I stayed there a week not eating,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.934\nI would get comfortable in that situation\nand I would slow my metabolism,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.101\nwhich I was sure would help me\nhold my breath\n\n00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:55.894\nlonger than I had been able to do it.\n\n00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.252\nI was completely wrong.\n\n00:09:59.394 --> 00:10:03.340\nI entered the sphere a week\nbefore the scheduled air date.\n\n00:10:03.365 --> 00:10:06.087\nAnd I thought everything\nseemed to be on track.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.934\nTwo days before my big\nbreath-hold attempt, for the record,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.934\nthe producers of my television special\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:18.824\nthought that just watching somebody\nholding their breath, and almost drowning,\n\n00:10:18.848 --> 00:10:20.934\nis too boring for television.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:28.342\nSo, I had to add handcuffs,\nwhile holding my breath, to escape from.\n\n00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:30.190\nThis was a critical mistake.\n\n00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:34.934\nBecause of the movement,\nI was wasting oxygen.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:39.200\nAnd by seven minutes I had gone\ninto these awful convulsions.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.692\nBy 7:08, I started to black out.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.934\nAnd by seven minutes and 30 seconds,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.390\nthey had to pull my body out\nand bring me back.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.934\nI had failed on every level.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:06.836\nSo, naturally, the only way out\nof the slump that I could think of was,\n\n00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:09.380\nI decided to call Oprah.\n\n00:11:09.404 --> 00:11:12.841\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.934\nI told her that I wanted to up the ante\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.934\nand hold my breath longer\nthan any human being ever had.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.716\nThis was a different record.\n\n00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.250\nThis was a pure O2 static apnea record\n\n00:11:23.274 --> 00:11:26.679\nthat Guinness had set\nthe world record at 13 minutes.\n\n00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:33.769\nSo, basically you breathe pure O2 first,\noxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,\n\n00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:35.856\nand you are able to hold much longer.\n\n00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:41.942\nI realized that my real competition\nwas the beaver.\n\n00:11:41.966 --> 00:11:44.712\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:48.934\n(Laughter ends)\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.934\nIn January of '08,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.575\nOprah gave me four months\nto prepare and train.\n\n00:11:54.623 --> 00:11:57.591\nSo, I would sleep\nin a hypoxic tent every night.\n\n00:11:57.615 --> 00:12:01.934\nA hypoxic tent is a tent\nthat simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.631\nSo, it's like base camp, Everest.\n\n00:12:04.655 --> 00:12:09.934\nWhat that does is, you start building up\nthe red bloodcell count in your body,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.196\nwhich helps you carry oxygen better.\n\n00:12:13.219 --> 00:12:16.934\nEvery morning, again,\nafter getting out of that tent,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.934\nyour brain is completely wiped out.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.934\nMy first attempt on pure O2,\nI was able to go up to 15 minutes.\n\n00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:26.934\nSo, it was a pretty big success.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.006\nThe neurosurgeon\npulled me out of the water\n\n00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.934\nbecause in his mind, at 15 minutes\nyour brain is done, you're brain dead.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.297\nSo, he pulled me up, and I was fine.\n\n00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:40.910\nThere was one person there\nthat was definitely not impressed.\n\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.344\nIt was my ex-girlfriend.\n\n00:12:43.368 --> 00:12:46.828\nWhile I was breaking the record\nunderwater for the first time,\n\n00:12:46.852 --> 00:12:49.934\nshe was sifting through my Blackberry,\nchecking all my messages.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.477\nMy brother had a picture of it.\nIt is really --\n\n00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:57.113\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:00.406\n(Laughter ends)\n\n00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.934\nI then announced that I was going\nto go for Sietas' record, publicly.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:09.354\nAnd what he did in response,\nis he went on Regis and Kelly,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.935\nand broke his old record.\n\n00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:16.235\nThen his main competitor\nwent out and broke his record.\n\n00:13:16.259 --> 00:13:20.934\nSo, he suddenly pushed the record up to\n16 minutes and 32 seconds.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.811\nWhich was three minutes\nlonger than I had prepared.\n\n00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:25.334\nIt was longer than the record.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.934\nI wanted to get the Science Times\nto document this.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.934\nI wanted to get them to do a piece on it.\n\n00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:36.934\nSo, I did what any person\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.647\nseriously pursuing scientific\nadvancement would do.\n\n00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:44.934\nI walked into the New York Times offices\nand did card tricks to everybody.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.894\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.339\nSo, I don't know if it was the magic\nor the lure of the Cayman Islands,\n\n00:13:52.363 --> 00:13:53.934\nbut John Tierney flew down\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.934\nand did a piece on the seriousness\nof breath-holding.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.482\nWhile he was there,\nI tried to impress him, of course.\n\n00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:01.934\nAnd I did a dive down to 160 feet,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:06.444\nwhich is basically the height\nof a 16 story building,\n\n00:14:06.468 --> 00:14:08.934\nand as I was coming up,\nI blacked out underwater,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.244\nwhich is really dangerous;\nthat's how you drown.\n\n00:14:11.268 --> 00:14:15.622\nLuckily, Kirk had seen me\nand he swam over and pulled me up.\n\n00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.934\nSo, I started full focus.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.934\nI completely trained to get\nmy breath-hold time up\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.934\nfor what I needed to do.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.244\nBut there was no way to prepare\nfor the live television aspect of it,\n\n00:14:26.268 --> 00:14:27.934\nbeing on Oprah.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:32.607\nBut in practice, I would do it\nface down, floating on the pool.\n\n00:14:32.631 --> 00:14:38.315\nBut for TV they wanted me to be upright\nso they could see my face, basically.\n\n00:14:39.084 --> 00:14:42.934\nThe other problem\nwas the suit was so buoyant\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.934\nthat they had to strap my feet in\nto keep me from floating up.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:49.934\nSo, I had to use my legs to hold my feet\ninto the straps that were loose,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.963\nwhich was a real problem for me.\n\n00:14:53.029 --> 00:14:56.934\nThat made me extremely nervous,\nraising the heart rate.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.934\nThen, what they also did was,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.377\nwhich we never did before,\nis there was a heart-rate monitor.\n\n00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.934\nAnd it was right next to the sphere.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.197\nSo, every time my heart would beat,\nI'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,\n\n00:15:08.221 --> 00:15:10.243\nyou know, the ticking, really loud.\n\n00:15:10.267 --> 00:15:12.411\nWhich was making me more nervous.\n\n00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:15.122\nAnd there was no way to slow\nmy heart rate down.\n\n00:15:17.162 --> 00:15:20.934\nNormally, I would start\nat 38 beats per minute,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.054\nand while holding my breath,\nit would drop to 12 beats per minute,\n\n00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.934\nwhich is pretty unusual.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.339\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:32.324 --> 00:15:37.095\nThis time it started at 120 beats,\nand it never went down.\n\n00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:40.934\nI spent the first five minutes underwater\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.934\ndesperately trying to slow\nmy heart rate down.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.610\nI was just sitting there thinking,\n\n00:15:45.634 --> 00:15:48.322\n\"I've got to slow this down.\nI'm going to fail.\"\n\n00:15:48.346 --> 00:15:49.934\nAnd I was getting more nervous.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.101\nAnd the heart rate\njust kept going up and up,\n\n00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:54.011\nall the way up to 150 beats.\n\n00:15:56.945 --> 00:16:00.611\nBasically it's the same thing that created\nmy downfall at Lincoln Center.\n\n00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:01.992\nIt was a waste of O2.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.482\nWhen I made it to the halfway\nmark, at eight minutes,\n\n00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:07.934\nI was 100 percent certain\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.101\nthat I was not going\nto be able to make this.\n\n00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:12.270\nThere was no way for me to do it.\n\n00:16:13.127 --> 00:16:15.934\nI figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.934\nto doing this breath-hold thing,\nif I had cracked early,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.934\nit would be a whole show\nabout how depressed I am.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.934\nSo, I figured I'm better off just fighting\nand staying there until I black out,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.197\nat least then they can pull me out\nand take care of me and all that.\n\n00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:34.330\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.006\nI kept pushing to 10 minutes.\n\n00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.742\nAt 10 minutes you start getting all\nthese really strong tingling sensations\n\n00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.346\nin your fingers and toes.\n\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.306\nAnd I knew that that was blood shunting,\n\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.824\nwhen the blood rushes away\nfrom your extremities\n\n00:16:46.848 --> 00:16:48.969\nto provide oxygen to your vital organs.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:56.569\nAt 11 minutes I started feeling\nthrobbing sensations in my legs,\n\n00:16:56.593 --> 00:16:59.934\nand my lips started\nto feel really strange.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.934\nAt minute 12 I started\nto have ringing in my ears,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.934\nand I started to feel my arm going numb.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.197\nAnd I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember\narm numb means heart attack.\n\n00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:12.934\nSo, I started to really\nget really paranoid.\n\n00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:16.900\nThen at 13 minutes, maybe\nbecause of the hypochondria,\n\n00:17:16.924 --> 00:17:20.934\nI started feeling pains all over my chest.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.011\nIt was awful.\n\n00:17:22.035 --> 00:17:23.036\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.934\nAt 14 minutes,\nI had these awful contractions,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.934\nlike this urge to breathe.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.600\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:34.829 --> 00:17:35.829\n(Laughter ends)\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:41.934\nAt 15 minutes I was suffering\nmajor O2 deprivation to the heart.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:44.934\nAnd I started having\nischemia to the heart.\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.783\nMy heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,\n\n00:17:47.807 --> 00:17:52.934\nto

Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time collectors here with us at TED, local collectors, to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know.The first is Bharti Kher. The central motif of Bharti's practice is the ready-made store-bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads, every day, in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage. But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world. Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it, by exploding it into something spectacular. She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals, which she then completely covers in bindis, often with potent symbolism. She says she first got started with 10 packets of bindis, and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.Our next artist, Balasubramaniam, really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation, working wonders with fiberglass. Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won't spend too much time on him here today, except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible.Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages, using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. These comics are a fundamental way that children, especially in the diaspora, learn their religious and mythological folk tales. I, for one, was steeped in these. Chitra basically remixes and re-titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics. And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography, sculpture, painting and installation. As you can see, he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art, and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work. He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay. He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin. Here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.This next artist, N.S. Harsha, actually has a studio right here in Mysore. He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition. He creates these fine, delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale. He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect, whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore, or in his increasingly ambitious installation work, here with 192 functioning sewing machines, fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.Mumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women. She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas, but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh. In this particular work, she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born, Kashmir-raised, and London-trained. He too is reinventing the miniature tradition. He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch, but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.I'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together. Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today, working across photography, video and installation. They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization, and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work. Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens, in which the city itself may have been the culprit.This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta. He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases, paintings of everyday objects, the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally, and on a grander and grander scale, by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations. And finally number 10, last and certainly not least,Ranjani Shettar, who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka, creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial, and brings, like Subodh, the local global. These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. And she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space, and interact with the objects. And light and shadow are a very important part of her work. She also explores themes of consumerism, and the environment, such as in this work, where these basket-like objects look organic and woven, and are woven, but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in. But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. Thank you very much for looking and listening.

"transcript": "This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School. And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted. In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant, while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison, the Chief of Urology at Harvard, actually harvesting the kidney. The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human.That was back in 1954, 55 years ago. Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago. Certainly many advances, many lives saved. But we have a major shortage of organs. In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat. That really has to do with our aging population. We're just getting older. Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive. But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.So, that's a challenge, not just for organs but also for tissues. Trying to replace pancreas, trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's. These are major issues. This is actually a very stunning statistic. Every 30 seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement. So, what can we do about it? We've talked about stem cells tonight. That's a way to do it. But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients, in terms of actual therapies for organs.Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate? Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves? It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually; it happens on the Earth every day. This is actually a picture of a salamander. Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate. You see here a little video. This is actually a limb injury in this salamander. And this is actually real photography, timed photography, showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days. You see the scar form. And that scar actually grows out a new limb.So, salamanders can do it. Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate? Actually, we can regenerate. Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day. As you age, as you get older. Your bones regenerate every 10 years. Your skin regenerates every two weeks. So, your body is constantly regenerating. The challenge occurs when there is an injury. At the time of injury or disease, the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body. It basically wants to fight off infection, and seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body, or your skin, the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in, to seal itself off from the outside.So, how can we harness that power? One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials. How does this work? Well, on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured. This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. And you see that it is injured. We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge. If you build that bridge, and you close off from the outside environment, then you can create that bridge, and cells that regenerate in your body, can then cross that bridge, and take that path.That's exactly what you see here. It's actually a smart biomaterial that we used, to actually treat this patient. This was an injured urethra on the left side. We used that biomaterial in the middle. And then, six months later on the right-hand side you see this reengineered urethra. Turns out your body can regenerate, but only for small distances. The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. So, we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps.So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances. What do we do now, if you have injury for larger organs? What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter? Then we can start to use cells. The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ, you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ, less than half the size of a postage stamp, you can then tease that tissue apart, and look at its basic components, the patient's own cells, you take those cells out, grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities, and then we then use scaffold materials.To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse, or your shirt, but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body. It disintegrates a few months later. It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle. It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue, and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.And that's what we did for this piece of muscle. This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle. We take the cells, we expand them, we place the cells on the scaffold, and we then place the scaffold back into the patient. But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient, we actually exercise it. We want to make sure that we condition this muscle, so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient. That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing this muscle bio-reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth.Okay. These are flat structures that we see here, the muscle. What about other structures? This is actually an engineered blood vessel. Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex. Here we take a scaffold, and we basically \u2014 scaffold can be like a piece of paper here. And we can then tubularize this scaffold. And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy. A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types. We take muscle cells, we paste, or coat the outside with these muscle cells, very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.You place the muscle cells on the outside. You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside. You now have your fully seeded scaffold. You're going to place this in an oven-like device. It has the same conditions as a human body, 37 degrees centigrade, 95 percent oxygen. You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered. This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain. And this is an X-ray showing you the patent, functional blood vessel. More complex structures such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you, they're definitely more complex because you're introducing two different cell types. But they are really acting mostly as conduits. You're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states. They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs. Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity, because you're asking these organs to act on demand.So, the bladder is one such organ. Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder, less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components, muscle, and these bladder specialized cells. We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities. It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ. We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder. We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells. We coat the outside with these muscle cells. We place it back into this oven-like device. From the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient.This actually shows the scaffold. The material is actually being coated with the cells. When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. We brought patients in, six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays, and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size pelvic cavity. For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large. (Laughter) It's true. And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right? (Laughter)So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures. But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it. This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered. And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy. We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells, and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing. We exercise these prior to implantation. Same strategy.And then the most complex are the solid organs. For solid organs, they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter. This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear. It's now being seeded with cartilage. That's the oven-like device; once it's coated it gets placed there. And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.This is actually digits that we're engineering. These are being layered, one layer at a time, first the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage. We then start adding the muscle on top. And you start layering these solid structures. Again, fairly more complex organs, but by far, the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized, a lot of blood vessel supply, organs such as the heart, the liver, the kidneys. This is actually an example \u2014 several strategies to engineer solid organs.This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer. And instead of using ink, we use \u2014 you just saw an inkjet cartridge \u2014 we just use cells. This is actually your typical desktop printer. It's actually printing this two chamber heart, one layer at a time. You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print, and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. (Applause) This technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute. And this is actually still, of course, experimental, not for use in patients.Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs. We actually take donor organs, organs that are discarded, and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs. So, for example on the left panel, top panel, you see a liver. We actually take the donor liver, we use very mild detergents, and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells out of the liver.Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up, it feels like a liver, we can hold it like a liver, it looks like a liver, but it has no cells. All we are left with is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver, all made up of collagen, a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject. We can use it from one patient to the next. We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy. We're actually injecting contrast into the organ. Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver. And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact. We then take the cells, the vascular cells, blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient's own cells. We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells. And we can then create functional livers. And that's actually what you're seeing. This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure, experimentally.For the kidney, as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw, the first slide I showed you, 90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent. So, another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will. So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells. And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered. They are actually making urine. Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger, and that is something we're working on right now at the institute. One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.If at all possible, we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs. We are limited with distances right now, but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time. If we cannot use smart biomaterials, then we'd rather use your very own cells.Why? Because they will not reject. We can take cells from you, create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject. And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ. If you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe. If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ.Why? Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want. A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell. We don't need to teach it to become another cell type. So, we prefer organ-specific cells. And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body, except for several which we still need stem cells for, like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas. And for those we still need stem cells. If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors.And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago, stem cells from the amniotic fluid, and the placenta, which have those properties. So, at this point, I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good, everything works. Actually no, these technologies really are not that easy. Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span.So, these are very tough technologies. Once you get the formula right you can replicate it. But it takes a lot to get there. So, I always like to show this cartoon. This is how to stop a runaway stage. And there you see the stagecoach driver, and he goes, on the top panel, He goes A, B, C, D, E, F. He finally stops the runaway stage. And those are usually the basic scientists, The bottom is usually the surgeons. (Laughter) I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny. (Laughter)But actually method A is the correct approach. And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic, we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question. Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child, your own family member, and then we proceed. Because our main goal, of course, is first, to do no harm.I'm going to show you now, a very short clip, It's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs. We started implanting some of these structures over 14 years ago. So, we have patients now walking around with organs, engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well. I'm going to show a clip of one young lady. She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality. She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN. We are just taking five seconds. This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.Video: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid that I was going to have like, an accident or something. And now I can just go and go out with my friends, go do whatever I want.Anthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise. And that is really very simple, to make our patients better. Thank you for your attention.

Why can't humans regenerate?\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nActually, we can regenerate.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nYour body has many organs\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand every single organ in your body\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nhas a cell population\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat's ready to take over at the time of injury.

Well, on the left side here\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nyou see a urethra which was injured.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThis is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd you see that it is injured.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nWe basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthat you can actually use as a bridge.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIf you build that bridge, and you close off\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nfrom the outside environment,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nthen you can create that bridge, and cells\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nthat regenerate in your body,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ncan then cross that bridge, and take that path.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nThat's exactly what you see here.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nIt's actually a smart biomaterial\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nthat we used, to actually treat this patient.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThis was an injured urethra on the left side.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nWe used that biomaterial in the middle.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd then, six months later on the right-hand side\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nyou see this reengineered urethra.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nTurns out your body can regenerate,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nbut only for small distances.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThe maximum efficient distance for regeneration\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nis only about one centimeter.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nSo, we can use these smart biomaterials\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nbut only for about one centimeter\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto bridge those gaps.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nWhat do we do now,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nif you have injury for larger organs?\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nWhat do we do when we have injuries\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nfor structures which are much larger\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthan one centimeter?\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThen we can start to use cells.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThe strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwith a diseased or injured organ,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nyou can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nless than half the size of a postage stamp,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nyou can then tease that tissue apart,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nand look at its basic components,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthe patient's own cells,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nyou take those cells out,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\ngrow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand then we then use scaffold materials.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nTo the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nor your shirt, but actually\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nthese materials are fairly complex\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nand they are designed to degrade once inside the body.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nIt disintegrates a few months later.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nIt's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthe cells to regenerate new tissue,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd that's what we did for this piece of muscle.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nThis is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthe structures to actually engineer the muscle.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWe take the cells, we expand them,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwe place the cells on the scaffold,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand we then place the scaffold back into the patient.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nBut actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwe actually exercise it.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nWe want to make sure that we condition\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthis muscle, so that it knows what to do\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nonce we put it into the patient.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThat's what you're seeing here. You're seeing\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthis muscle bio-reactor\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nactually exercising the muscle back and forth.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nOkay. These are flat structures that we see here,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthe muscle.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWhat about other structures?\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThis is actually an engineered blood vessel.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nVery similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nHere we take a scaffold,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nand we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd we can then tubularize this scaffold.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nAnd what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nA blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nWe take muscle cells, we paste,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nor coat the outside with these muscle cells,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nvery much like baking a layer cake, if you will.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nYou place the muscle cells on the outside.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nYou now have your fully seeded scaffold.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nYou're going to place this in an oven-like device.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nIt has the same conditions as a human body,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\n37 degrees centigrade,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\n95 percent oxygen.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nYou then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThis is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd this is an X-ray showing you\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nthe patent, functional blood vessel.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nMore complex structures\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nsuch as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthey're definitely more complex\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nbecause you're introducing two different cell types.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nBut they are really acting mostly as conduits.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nYou're allowing fluid or air to go through\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nat steady states.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nThey are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nHollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nbecause you're asking these organs to act on demand.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nSo, the bladder is one such organ.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSame strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nless than half the size of a postage stamp.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWe then tease the tissue apart\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\ninto its two individual cell components,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nmuscle, and these bladder specialized cells.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nWe grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nIt takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWe then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWe coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nWe coat the outside with these muscle cells.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nWe place it back into this oven-like device.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nFrom the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nyou can put the organ right back into the patient.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThis actually shows the scaffold.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThe material is actually being coated with the cells.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhen we did the first clinical trial for these patients\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwe actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nWe brought patients in,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nsix to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nand we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\npelvic cavity.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nFor the second phase of the trials\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nwe just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nIt's true.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthan the other structures.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nBut there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThis is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWe take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWe exercise these prior to implantation.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nSame strategy.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd then the most complex are the solid organs.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nFor solid organs, they're more complex\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nbecause you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nThis is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIt's now being seeded with cartilage.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThat's the oven-like device;\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nonce it's coated it gets placed there.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nThis is actually digits that we're engineering.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nThese are being layered, one layer at a time,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nfirst the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWe then start adding the muscle on top.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nAnd you start layering these solid structures.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAgain, fairly more complex organs,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nbut by far, the most complex solid organs\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nare actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\na lot of blood vessel supply,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\norgans such as the heart,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nthe liver, the kidneys.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nThis is actually an example -- several strategies\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nto engineer solid organs.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nThis is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge --\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nwe just use cells.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThis is actually your typical desktop printer.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nIt's actually printing this two chamber heart,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\none layer at a time.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nYou see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand about four to six hours later\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nyou see the muscle cells contract.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:26.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThis technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd this is actually still, of course, experimental,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nnot for use in patients.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnother strategy that we have followed\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nis actually to use decellularized organs.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nWe actually take donor organs,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\norgans that are discarded,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand we then can use very mild detergents\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nto take all the cell elements out of these organs.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo, for example on the left panel,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\ntop panel, you see a liver.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe actually take the donor liver,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nwe use very mild detergents,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nout of the liver.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nTwo weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nit feels like a liver,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nwe can hold it like a liver,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nit looks like a liver, but it has no cells.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAll we are left with\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nis the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nall made up of collagen,\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\na material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nWe can use it from one patient to the next.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nWe then take this vascular structure\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nYou can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nWe're actually injecting contrast into the organ.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nNow you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ninto this decellularized liver.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nWe then take the cells, the vascular cells,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nblood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nwith the patient's own cells.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nWe perfuse the outside of the liver\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwith the patient's own liver cells.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd we can then create functional livers.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd that's actually what you're seeing.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThis is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nof the liver structure, experimentally.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nFor the kidney,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nas I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nthe first slide I showed you,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\n90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nare waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nSo, another strategy we're following\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nis actually to create wafers\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nthat we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nSo, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nAnd then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThey are actually making urine.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAgain, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand that is something we're working on\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nright now at the institute.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nOne of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nis what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nIf at all possible,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwe really would like to use smart biomaterials\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nthat we can just take off the shelf\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nand regenerate your organs.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWe are limited with distances right now,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nbut our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nIf we cannot use smart biomaterials,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthen we'd rather use your very own cells.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nWhy? Because they will not reject.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nWe can take cells from you,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ncreate the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAnd if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIf you present with a diseased wind pipe\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwe'd like to take cells from your windpipe.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIf you present with a diseased pancreas\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nwe'd like to take cells from that organ.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWhy? Because we'd rather take those cells\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nwhich already know that those are the cell types you want.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nA windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWe don't need to teach it to become another cell type.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo, we prefer organ-specific cells.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nexcept for several which we still need stem cells for,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nlike heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd for those we still need stem cells.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nIf we cannot use stem cells from your body\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nthen we'd like to use donor stem cells.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd we prefer cells that will not reject\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nand will not form tumors.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd we're working a lot with the stem cells that we\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\npublished on two years ago,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nstem cells from the amniotic fluid,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nand the placenta, which have those properties.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSo, at this point, I do want to tell you that\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nsome of the major challenges we have.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nYou know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\neverything works. Actually no,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthese technologies really are not that easy.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nSome of the work you saw today\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nwas performed by over 700 researchers\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nat our institute across a 20-year time span.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nSo, these are very tough technologies.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nOnce you get the formula right you can replicate it.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nBut it takes a lot to get there.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nSo, I always like to show this cartoon.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nThis is how to stop a runaway stage.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd there you see the stagecoach driver,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand he goes, on the top panel,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nHe goes A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nHe finally stops the runaway stage.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd those are usually the basic scientists,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nThe bottom is usually the surgeons.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nI'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nBut actually method A is the correct approach.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nto the clinic,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nwe've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nin the laboratory before we ever\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nlaunch these technologies to patients.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nAnd when we launch these technologies to patients\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nwe want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nAre you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nyour own family member, and then we proceed.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nBecause our main goal, of course,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nis first, to do no harm.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nI'm going to show you now, a very short clip,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nIt's a five second clip of a patient\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nwho received one of the engineered organs.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nWe started implanting some of these structures\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nover 14 years ago.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo, we have patients now walking around with organs,\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nengineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nI'm going to show a clip of one young lady.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nShe had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nShe did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWe are just taking five seconds.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nThis is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nVideo: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nthat I was going to have like, an accident or something.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nAnd now I can just go and\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\ngo out with my friends,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\ngo do whatever I want.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nAnthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nis a single promise.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nAnd that is really very simple,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nto make our patients better.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nThank you for your attention.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Your health depends on where you live", "duration": "565", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_davenhall_your_health_depends_on_where_you_live", "transcript": "Can geographic information make you healthy? In 2001 I got hit by a train. My train was a heart attack. I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward, recuperating from emergency surgery. And I suddenly realized something: that I was completely in the dark. I started asking my questions, \"Well, why me?\" \"Why now?\" \"Why here?\" \"Could my doctor have warned me?\"So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health. Genetics, lifestyle and environment. That's going to sort of contain our risks, and if we manage those risks we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life. Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part. And you know why I understand that? Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this.Have you ever had to fill out those long, legal-size forms in your doctor's office? I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right? (Laughter) Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history, your medication history, your surgical history, your allergy history ... did I forget any history?But this part of the equation I didn't really get, and I don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation. What does that mean, my environment? Well, it can mean a lot of things. This is my life. These are my life places. We all have these. While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about: How many places have you lived?Just think about that, you know, wander through your life thinking about this. And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places. You spend it at rest and you spend it at work. And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place. So, it's not really simple when somebody asks you, \"Where do you live, where do you work, and where do you spend all your time? And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see?\" Well, when I have done this on myself, I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places. And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time, even though I'm an extensive global trekker.Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here. I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania. I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania, but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs. You know, breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and methane gas, in unequal quantities \u2014 19 years of this. And if you've been in that part of the country, this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.So then I decided to leave that part of the world, and I was going to go to the mid-west. OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky. Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown. They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene. Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now, breathing various concentrations of that. And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it. It was insidious and it was really happening.Then I decided I had to get really smart, I would take this job in the West Coast. And I moved to Redlands California. Very nice, and there my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them, I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone. Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation. Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day. If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.So, what's wrong with this picture? Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here. The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office: They never ask me about my place history. No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me, \"Where have you lived?\" They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach. They really don't do that. It's missing. Look at the kind of data that's available. This data's from all over the world \u2014 countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.Now, I've circled the places where I've been. Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places. Right? So, how many people are in the white? How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space? Anybody? Boy you're lucky. How many have spent it in the red places? Oh, not so lucky. There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world. They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck. But none of that's in my medical record. And it's not in yours either.So, here's my friend Paul. He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours, 24/7, 365 days out of the year for the last two years, everywhere he went. And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States. And this is where he has spent most of his time. If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do. Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right. We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time. And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA.Did you know that data existed? For every community in the United States, you could have your own personalized map of that. So, our cell phones can now build a place history. This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone. This might be what we end up with.This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right? This could be my little assessment. And he looks at that and he says, \"Whoa Bill, I suggest that maybe you not decide, just because you're out here in beautiful California, and it's warm every day, that you get out and run at six o'clock at night. I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill, because of this report.\"What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions. Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information. It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this. And they're in the early stages of development. These programs need to be supported, and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today.The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record, we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record. It not only will be important for the physician; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon. But it will also be useful for us. I could have made the decision, if I had this information, not to move to the ozone capital of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision. Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company.With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago. Just look at that for a minute. That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about, was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness, and how our healthcare system actually operates. That was what he was talking about on that quote. And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago. So, I'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records. So with that, I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health: Geography always matters. And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.

These are my life places.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nWe all have these.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nWhile I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nHow many places have you lived?\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nJust think about that, you know, wander through\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nyour life thinking about this.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nYou spend it at rest and you spend it at work.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\ntraveling some place.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nSo, it's not really simple\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nwhen somebody asks you, \"Where do you live, where do you work,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nand where do you spend all your time?\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd where do you expose yourselves to risks\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat maybe perhaps you don't even see?\"\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nWell, when I have done this on myself,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nI always come to the conclusion\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nthat I spend about 75 percent of my time\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nrelatively in a small number of places.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd I don't wander far from that place\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nfor a majority of my time,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:48.958\neven though I'm an extensive global trekker.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nI started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nI don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nbut this is where I spent my first 19 years\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nwith my little young lungs.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nYou know, breathing high concentrations here\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nof sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nand methane gas,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nin unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd if you've been in that part of the country,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthis is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo then I decided to leave that part of the world,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nand I was going to go to the mid-west.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nOK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nWell, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThey manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand benzene.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nOkay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nbreathing various concentrations of that.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nIt was insidious and it was really happening.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThen I decided I had to get really smart,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI would take this job in the West Coast.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd I moved to Redlands California.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nVery nice, and there\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nmy older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nI filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nOkay? Almost like the highest in the nation.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAlright, this is what it looks like on a good day.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIf you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nSo, what's wrong with this picture?\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nWell, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThe one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThey never ask me about my place history.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNo doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\n\"Where have you lived?\"\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThey haven't asked me what kind of the quality\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nof the drinking water that I put in my mouth\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nor the food that I ingest into my stomach.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThey really don't do that.

Boy you're lucky.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nHow many have spent it in the red places?\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nOh, not so lucky.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThere are thousands of these kinds of maps\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat are displayed in atlases\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nall over the world.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThey give us some sense of what's going\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nto be our train wreck.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nBut none of that's in my medical record.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nAnd it's not in yours either.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nSo, here's my friend Paul.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nHe's a colleague.

What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again, not just represent things. This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project I, and my firm, have ever been involved in. I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet. I thought it represented the importance of the architect.I stayed thrilled until I got home, threw the helmet onto my bed, fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription. (Laughter) Now, I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today. We are for decorative purposes only. (Laughter)Now, who do we have to blame? We can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious. And we architects are cowards. So, as we have faced liability, we have stepped back and back, and unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is: power. So, eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position, way over here.Now, what did we do? We're cowards, but we're smart cowards. And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture. And we announced, \"Hey, architecture, it's over here, in this autonomous language we're going to seed control of processes.\" And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession. We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution, as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create.Now, something else happened. And that's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches. And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided, but we would merely write it off as merely execution. Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act, and nine months of gestation, and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor is merely execution.So, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back creation and execution. And we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects. Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years and start reinjecting agency, social engineering, back into architecture. Now, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do, like managing contracts, learning how to write contracts, understanding procurement processes, understanding the time value of money and cost estimation.But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process, into three very pedantic statements. The first is: Take core positions with your client. I know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.The second position is: Actually take positions. Take joint positions with your client. This is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency. But it has to be done together. And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions. And both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you've taken.Now, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this. I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control. You do not know what the end result is. But I promise you, with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment, you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention, and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of.Alright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches. This is the modus operandi that we have today. We roll 120-foot Spartan, i.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy. And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right? Well, how about instead of doing that, we roll up to the gates something they want.Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor, because of course we all know that inside of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears. So, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse the vessel by which you get through the gate, get through the constraints of a project. At which point, you and your client have the ability to start considering what you're going to put inside that vessel, the agency, the vision. And if you do that, you do that responsibly, I believe that instead of delivering Spartans, you can deliver maidens.And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this. If we are so good at our craft shouldn't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project's and the client's constraints? Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room\u2014 well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room. And that's a project that is just about to open next week, the new home for the Dallas Theater Center, the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.Now, I'm going to present it on the same terms: issue, position and architectural manifestation. Now, the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York, Chicago and Seattle. And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership. But it also had to do with something rather unusual, and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation? Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building. When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down. This building, when an artistic director wanted to do a \"Cherry Orchard\" and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage, they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole. Well, that's exciting. And you can start to get the best artistic directors, scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can't do elsewhere.So, the first position we took was, \"Hey, we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company.\" The second issue is a nuance of the first. And that's that the company and the building was multiform. That meant that they were able to perform, as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor, arena, traverse, you name it. All they needed was labor.Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions around the world. It started to become hard to raise operational costs, operational budgets. So, they stopped having inexpensive labor. And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium.So, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided, the ability to move between stage configurations, had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably. The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb. It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house.At first blush you think, \"Hey it's crazy, what could you possibly gain?\" We created what we like to call superfly. (Laughter) Now, superfly, the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower, and you smear them across flytower and auditorium. Suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations. And because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw paint and replace, with a minimum of cost.But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected. And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way. And that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief. So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object. But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of Macbeth, if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life, he or she can do so.Now, in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable. In fact it really was the clients who had to do it. They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture and one-third infrastructure, to actually the inverse, two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture. That's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept. But based on the positions, they took the educated leap of faith to do so. And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine.Now, that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time. But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences. Meaning: The artistic director doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects, because they say the first thing they have to do, the first five minutes of any show, is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron. Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture. So, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw. You're going down into our lobby, go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not, up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside, in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance, into the interior of the auditorium. And here is the fruition of that in actuality. These are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside, in or from the inside, out, performers or audience alike.Now, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long. But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry, a first act in thrust, an intermission in Greek, a second act in arena, and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits. Now that, I would say, is architecture performing. It is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director.I'll go through the three basic configurations. This is the flat floor configuration. You notice that there is no proscenium, the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats, the floor in the auditorium is flat.The first configuration is easy to understand. The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage, and the seats come in.The third configuration is a little harder to understand. Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space. And some of the seats need to actually change their direction, and change their rake, to allow that to happen.I'll do it again so you can see it. There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. And there it is in the thrust configuration.In order to do that, again, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks. And they told us one important thing: \"You shall not beta-test.\" Meaning, nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it. But they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift. Now, if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey, that would be bad. If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night, that would also be bad. And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will.The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house. In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it, changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor, changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating, at will.Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration. The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space. Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium. And ultimately, up in the flytower, the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.As I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration. But we got this other benefit, and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage Dallas on the outside. Here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil. Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves, again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify, if you chose, the operations of the theater going on behind, rehearsals and so forth. But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas, to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.Now, if I'll take you through \u2014 this is an early concept sketch \u2014 take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together. Effectively you would have something like this. You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber: \"Aida,\" their elephants, you can bring the elephants in. You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas or vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium. You'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession, allow people to come in and out for an intermission, or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.As I said, all the balconies can move, but they can also be disappeared completely. The proscenium can fly. You can bring large objects into the chamber itself. But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure, is something that is represented by this. And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built, but at least suggests the ideas.This building has the ability, in short order, to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out. Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines, please consider doing your Christmas party here. (Laughter) That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums. That's an enormous benefit.So, the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic, light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics, great intimacy Shakespeare, but can also do Beckett with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it. Here it is in a flat floor configuration. The theater has been going through its kind of paces.Here it is in an end stage configuration. It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band. We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked, and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them. It was very unusual. Here it is in a thrust configuration. And last but not least, you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.I'm going to show you a brief time lapse. As I said, this can be done with only two people, and with a minimum amount of time. This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it. So, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around. And think of it being done with just a few people. Again, just a couple people are required. (Laughter) I promise. Et voila. (Applause)So, just in conclusion, a few shots. This is the AT&T Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater. There it is at night. And last but not least the entire AT&T Performing Arts Center. You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something. But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going, what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with. And we took positions with them, and it was through those positions that we began to take architectural manifestations and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us, really none of us could ever have conceived of initially or individually.

We're cowards,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbut we're smart cowards.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnd so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nAnd we announced, \"Hey, architecture, it's over here,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nin this autonomous language\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nwe're going to seed control of processes.\"\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nWe actually created an artificial schism\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nbetween creation and execution,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nas if you could actually create without knowing how to execute\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nand as if you could actually execute\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nwithout knowing how to create.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nNow, something else happened.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd that's when we began to sell the world\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthat architecture was created by individuals\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\ncreating genius sketches.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nfor years and years and years is not only something\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nto be derided,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbut we would merely write it off as\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nmerely execution.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nNow I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand nine months of gestation,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nand, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nis merely execution.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nSo, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\ncreation and execution.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd we need to start authoring processes again\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\ninstead of authoring objects.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nNow, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nand start reinjecting agency,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nsocial engineering, back into architecture.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nNow, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nlike managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nunderstanding procurement processes,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nunderstanding the time value of money and cost estimation.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nBut I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\ninto three very pedantic statements.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe first is: Take core positions with your client.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nI know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThe second position is: Actually take positions.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nTake joint positions with your client.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nThis is the moment in which you as the architect\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand your client can begin to inject\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nvision and agency.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nBut it has to be done together.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nAnd then only after this is done\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nare you allowed to do this, begin to put forward\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\narchitectural manifestations\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat manifest those positions.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd both owner and architect alike\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nare empowered to critique those manifestations\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nbased on the positions that you've taken.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nNow, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nI'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nYou do not know what the end result is.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nBut I promise you, with enough brain power\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand enough passion and enough commitment,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nyou will arrive at conclusions\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nthat will transcend convention,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nand will simply be something\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthat you could not have initially\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nor individually conceived of.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAlright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nof simple dumb sketches.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThis is the modus operandi that we have today.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWe roll 120-foot Spartan,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:33.958\ni.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nAnd we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nWell, how about instead of doing that,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwe roll up to the gates something they want.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nNow this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nbecause of course we all know that inside\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nof the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthe vessel by which\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nyou get through the gate,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nget through the constraints of a project.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAt which point, you and your client\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nhave the ability to start considering what\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nyou're going to put inside that vessel,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthe agency, the vision.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd if you do that, you do that responsibly,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nI believe that instead of delivering Spartans,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nyou can deliver maidens.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIf we are so good at our craft\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nshouldn't we be able to conceive\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nof an architectural manifestation\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat slides seamlessly through\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nthe project's and the client's constraints?\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nNow, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat's very dear to many people in this room--\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nwell, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd that's a project that is just about to open next week,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthe new home for the Dallas Theater Center,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthe Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nNow, I'm going to present it on the same terms:\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nissue, position and architectural manifestation.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nNow, the first issue that we faced\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwas that the Dallas Theater Center\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nhad a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nof some place outside of the triumvirate\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nof New York, Chicago and Seattle.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nBut it also had to do with something rather unusual,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nWhy was this horrible little building\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nso important to their renown and their innovation?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBecause they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWhen you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThis building, when an artistic director\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwanted to do a \"Cherry Orchard\" and wanted people\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nand wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthey brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWell, that's exciting.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd you can start to get the best artistic directors,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nscenic designers and actors from around the country\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nto come to perform here\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nbecause you can do things you can't do elsewhere.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nSo, the first position we took was,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\n\"Hey, we as architects had better not show up\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand do a pristine building\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nthat doesn't engender the same freedoms that this\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nold dilapidated shed provided the company.\"\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThe second issue is a nuance of the first.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd that's that the company and the building was multiform.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nThat meant that they were able to perform,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nas long as they had labor\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nthey were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\narena, traverse, you name it.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAll they needed was labor.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nWell, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\naround the world.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIt started to become hard to raise operational costs,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\noperational budgets.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo, they stopped having inexpensive labor.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd eventually they had to freeze their organization\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\ninto something called a bastardized thruscenium.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nSo, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthe ability to move between stage configurations,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nhad better be able to be done\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwithout relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nThe architectural manifestation\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nwas frankly just dumb.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nIt was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nand redefine them as above house and below house.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nAt first blush you think, \"Hey it's crazy,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nwhat could you possibly gain?\"\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWe created what we like to call superfly.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nNow, superfly, the concept is\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nyou take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand you smear them across flytower and auditorium.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nSuddenly the artistic director\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\ncan move between different stage\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand audience configurations.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd because that flytower has the ability to pick up\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nall the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\ncan be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\npaint and replace,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwith a minimum of cost.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nBut there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthat was unexpected.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nin a most unusual way.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd that provided the artistic director suddenly\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nthe ability to define suspension of disbelief.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nSo, the building affords artistic directors the freedom\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nto conceive of almost any kind of activity\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nunderneath this floating object.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nBut also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nsuch that in the last act of Macbeth,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nif he or she wants you to associate\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthe parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nhe or she can do so.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nNow, in order to do this we and the clients\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nhad to do something fairly remarkable.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nIn fact it really was the clients who had to do it.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThey had to make a decision, based on the positions we took\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nto redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand one-third infrastructure,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nto actually the inverse,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\ntwo-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThat's a lot for a client to commit to\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbefore you actually see the fruition of the concept.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nBut based on the positions,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthey took the educated leap of faith to do so.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd effectively we created what we like to call\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\na theater machine.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nNow, that theater machine has ability\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nto move between a whole series of configurations\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nat the push of a button and a few stagehands\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nin a short amount of time.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBut it also has the potential\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nMeaning: The artistic director\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ndoesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nOne of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nis they hate us architects,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nbecause they say the first thing they have to do,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe first five minutes of any show,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nis they have to get our architecture\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nout of the mind of their patron.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nWell now there are potentials of this building\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nto allow the artistic director\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto actually move into the building\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nwithout using our architecture.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nYou're going down into our lobby,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\ngo through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nup through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nBut there is also the potential\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nto allow people to move directly from the outside,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nin this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\ninto the interior of the auditorium.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd here is the fruition of that in actuality.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nThese are the two large pivoting doors\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nthat allow people to move directly from the outside, in\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nor from the inside, out,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nperformers or audience alike.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthis is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nBut imagine the freedoms\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nif you could take this further, that in fact you could consider\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\na Wagnerian entry,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\na first act in thrust,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nan intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nand you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nNow that, I would say, is architecture performing.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nIt is taking the hand of the architect\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nto actually remove the hand of the architect\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nin favor of the hand of the artistic director.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nI'll go through the three basic configurations.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThis is the flat floor configuration.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nYou notice that there is no proscenium,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nthe balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthe floor in the auditorium is flat.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThe first configuration is easy to understand.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe balconies come down, you see that the orchestra\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nbegins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand the seats come in.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThe third configuration is a little harder to understand.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nHere you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nin order to bring a thrust into the space.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd some of the seats need to actually change their direction,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand change their rake, to allow that to happen.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nI'll do it again so you can see it.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThere you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nAnd there it is in the thrust configuration.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nIn order to do that,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nagain, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd they told us one important thing:\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\n\"You shall not beta-test.\"\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nMeaning, nothing that we do\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\ncan we be the first ones to do it.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nBut they were willing for us to apply technologies\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nfrom other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd the solution in terms of the balconies\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nwas to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nNow, if you were to take a scoreboard\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand drop it on dirt and whiskey,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nthat would be bad.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIf you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nand be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthat would also be bad.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand allowed the theater and our client\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto actually do this with confidence\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthat they would be able to change over their configurations at will.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nThe second technology that we applied\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nwas actually using things that you know from\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nthe stage side of an opera house.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nIn this case what we're doing is we're taking\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nthe orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nchanging the rake, taking it back to flat floor,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nchanging the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nrakes and viewing angles\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nof people in the orchestra seating, at will.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nHere you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nto thrust configuration.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nThe proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nin which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nHere you see the various acoustic baffles as well as\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthe flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd ultimately, up in the flytower,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthe scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAs I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nyet affordable configuration.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut we got this other benefit, and that was\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nthe ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nDallas on the outside.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nHere you see the building in its current state\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nwith blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nActually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nthat are integrated into the windows themselves,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nagain with failsafe mechanisms\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthat can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nif you chose, the operations of the theater\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\ngoing on behind, rehearsals and so forth.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nBut you also have the ability\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nto allow the audience to see Dallas,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nto perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nNow, if I'll take you through --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthis is an early concept sketch --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\ntake you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nEffectively you would have something like this.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nYou would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\n\"Aida,\" their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nYou would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nor vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nYou'd be able to open portions in order to\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nchange the procession,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nallow people to come in and out for an intermission,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nor to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAs I said, all the balconies can move,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nbut they can also be disappeared completely.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nThe proscenium can fly.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nYou can bring large objects into the chamber itself.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nBut most convincingly when we had to confront the idea\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nof changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nis something that is represented by this.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nAnd again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nbut at least suggests the ideas.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nThis building has the ability, in short order,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nto go back to a flat floor organization\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nsuch that they can rent it out.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nNow, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nplease consider doing your Christmas party here.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nThat allows the company to raise operational budgets\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nwithout having to compete with other venues\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nwith much larger auditoriums.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nThat's an enormous benefit.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nSo, the theater company has the ability\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nto do totally hermetic,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nlight-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ngreat intimacy Shakespeare,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nbut can also do Beckett\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nwith the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nHere it is in a flat floor configuration.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nThe theater has been going through its kind of paces.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nHere it is in an end stage configuration.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nIt's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nWe stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nIt was very unusual.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nHere it is in a thrust configuration.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd last but not least,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nyou see this already has the ability to create events\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nin order to generate operational budgets\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nto overcome the building in fact performing\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nto allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nI'm going to show you a brief time lapse.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nAs I said, this can be done with only two people,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand with a minimum amount of time.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nThis is the first time that actually the changeover was done\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand so there is literally thousands of people because\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\neveryone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nSo, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nAnd think of it being done with just a few people.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nAgain, just a couple people are required.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nI promise.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nEt voila.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:44.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nSo, just in conclusion, a few shots.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nThis is the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center's\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nDee and Charles Wyly Theater.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nThere it is at night.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nAnd last but not least the entire AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nYou can see the Winspear Opera House on the right\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nand the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nAnd to remind you that here is an example in which\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\narchitecture actually did something.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nBut we got to that conclusion\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nwithout understanding where we were going,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nwhat we knew were a series of issues that the company\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nand the client was confronted with.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nAnd we took positions with them, and it was through those positions\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nthat we began to take architectural manifestations\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nand we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nreally none of us could ever\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nhave conceived of initially or individually.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Embrace your inner girl", "duration": "1194", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/eve_ensler_embrace_your_inner_girl", "transcript": "Namaste. Good morning. I'm very happy to be here in India. And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and \"The Vagina Monologues,\" traveling the world, essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women.What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us. And I want to call it the girl cell. And it's in men as well as in women. I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race.And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell, the oppression of these cells, the reinterpretation of these cells, the undermining of these cells, getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing, eradicating, destroying, reducing these cells, basically began the process of killing off the girl cell, which was, by the way, patriarchy.I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. And it is essential to balance, to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us. And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion, and it's empathy, and it's passion itself, and it's vulnerability, and it's openness, and it's intensity, and it's association, and it's relationship, and it is intuitive.And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom, and that vulnerability is our greatest strength, and that emotions have inherent logic, which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action. And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be, that compassion clouds your thinking, that it gets in the way, that vulnerability is weakness, that emotions are not to be trusted, and you're not supposed to take things personally, which is one of my favorites.I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl. How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy? To be a boy really means not to be a girl. To be a man means not to be a girl. To be a woman means not to be a girl. To be strong means not to be a girl. To be a leader means not to be a girl. I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that. (Laughter)And I'd also like to say that the irony of course, is that denying girl, suppressing girl, suppressing emotion, refusing feeling has lead thus here. Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence, the most horrific poverty, genocide, mass rapes, the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control. And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl-ship, we do not feel what is going on.So, we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening. I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo. For me, it was the turning point of my life. I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years. I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world, a lot of violence.I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years. But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul. I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital, with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met. His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege. In the Congo, for those of you who don't know, there has been a war raging for the last 12 years, a war that has killed nearly six million people. It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there.When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories. Their stories were so horrific, and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence, that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered. And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering, listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated, who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes, literally, inside them where their pee and poop came out of them.Listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled, and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically, all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them. My mind was so shattered.But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. That shattering, that opening of my girl cell, that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous, and braver, and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life.I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually \u2014 that feelings get in the way of empire-building. Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth, and excavating the Earth, and destroying things. I remember, for example, when my father, who was very, very violent, used to beat me. And he would actually say, while he was beating me, \"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry.\" Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him. And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing.I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell. And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell. (Applause) I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet: to be tough, to be hardened, to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry. I actually realized once in Kosovo, when I watched a man break down, that bullets are actually hardened tears, that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion, and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful and violent.And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure, to pretend they know things when they don't know things, or why would we be where we are? To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess. And I will tell you a very funny story. On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane. And all these men, literally at least 10 men, were in their little seats watching chick flicks. And they were all alone, and I thought, \"This is the secret life of men.\" (Laughter)I've traveled, as I said, to many, many countries, and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world. And we heard from Sunitha yesterday, and Kavita about what we do to girls. But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns, who are literally being treated like ashtrays. I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans. I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles. I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate, or we make them feel bad about being too smart. We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave, to tone it down, not to be too intense. We sell them, we kill them as embryos, we enslave them, we rape them. We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities.The selling of girls is rampant across the planet. And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows. But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24, they are they key, really, in the developing world, as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity. And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be, including lack of access to healthcare, education, healthy foods, labor force participation. The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings, which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.The state of girls, the condition of girls, will, in my belief \u2014 and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world \u2014 determine whether the species survives. And what I want to suggest is that, having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called \"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,\" I've been talking to girls for five years, and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb \"to please.\" Girls are trained to please. I want to change the verb. I want us all to change the verb. I want the verb to be \"educate,\" or \"activate,\" or \"engage,\" or \"confront,\" or \"defy,\" or \"create.\" If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them.And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl, who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them. I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands, for example, who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself.There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face.There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill, who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. And this girl, when she was 17 years old, wore a burqa in Afghanistan, and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women, underneath her burqa, with a video. And that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say, \"End the occupation.\" And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank.And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist. And she was holding her baby. And I asked her if she loved her baby. And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said, \"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby? It's my baby and it's full of love.\"The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing. There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya. Dorcas is 15 years old, and she was trained in self-defense. A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men. They kidnapped her, they put her in a car. And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples, she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car.In Kenya, in August, I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls, a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio. Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl, she was female genitally mutilated. And she made a decision as many women do across this planet, that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls.So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley. She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like, and what a mutilated vagina looked like. And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her, and she said, \"Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster.\" So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.And then we asked her, \"Okay, what else do you need?\" And she said, \"Well, now, I need a house.\" So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land. And it was a house where girls could run away, they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut, they could go to school. And in the years that Agnes has had the house, she has changed the situation there. She has literally become deputy mayor. She's changed the rules. The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families. And there was a young girl named Jaclyn. Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya. So cows are dying, and cows are the most valued possession. And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows. And she knew that meant she would be cut. She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school. She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future. She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house, Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days, two days through Masai land. She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night. She imagined her father killing her on one hand, and Mama Agnes greeting her, with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. And when she got to the house she was greeted. Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her, and Agnes supported her for the year. She went to school and she found her voice, and she found her identity, and she found her heart.Then, her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation, after a year. I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. In that hut, we walked in, and her father and his four wives were sitting there, and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled, and her primary mother, who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders. When her father saw her and saw who she had become, in her full girl self, he threw his arms around her and broke down crying. He said, \"You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman. We will not cut you. And I give you my word, here and now, that we will not cut your sisters either.\"And what she said to him was, \"You were willing to sell me for four cows, and a calf and some blankets. But I promise you, now that I will be educated I will always take care of you, and I will come back and I will build you a house. And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life.\"For me, that is the power of girls. And that is the power of transformation. I want to close today with a new piece from my book. And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here. And I want to do it for Sunitha. And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else. But I really want to do it for each and every person here, to value the girl in us, to value the part that cries, to value the part that's emotional, to value the part that's vulnerable, to understand that's where the future lies.This is called \"I'm An Emotional Creature.\" And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A. I was asking girls if they like being a girl, and all the girls were like, \"No, I hate it. I can't stand it. It's all bad. My brothers get everything.\" And this girl just sat up and went, \"I love being a girl. I'm an emotional creature!\" (Laughter) This is for her:I love being a girl. I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before. I am an emotional creature. Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas. They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears. Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off, even though she appears to give you what you want. I know when a storm is coming. I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air. I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.I am an emotional creature. I love that I do not take things lightly. Everything is intense to me, the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up, the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.I am an emotional creature. I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that. Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing, or it's only because I'm a girl. These feelings make me better. They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.I am an emotional creature. There is a particular way of knowing. It's like the older women somehow forgot. I rejoice that it's still in my body. Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall. I know we have pushed the Earth too far. I know my father isn't coming back, and that no one's prepared for the fire. I know that lipstick means more than show, and boys are super insecure, and so-called terrorists are made, not born. I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability. (Laughter) And you know what? Sometimes it should. This is not extreme. It's a girl thing, what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down, not to be so extreme, to be reasonable. I am an emotional creature. It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate. You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave. I am an emotional creature. Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off? I am your remaining memory. I can take you back. Nothing's been diluted. Nothing's leaked out. I love, hear me, I love that I can feel the feelings inside you, even if they stop my life, even if they break my heart, even if they take me off track, they make me responsible.I am an emotional, I am an emotional, incondotional, devotional creature. And I love, hear me, I love, love, love being a girl. Can you say it with me? I love, I love, love, love being a girl! Thank you very much.

What does it mean to be a boy?\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nTo be a boy really means not to be a girl.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nTo be a man means not to be a girl.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nTo be a woman means not to be a girl.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nTo be strong means not to be a girl.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nTo be a leader means not to be a girl.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nI actually think that\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nbeing a girl is so powerful\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthat we've had to train everyone not to be that.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd I'd also like to say that the irony\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nof course, is that denying girl,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nsuppressing girl, suppressing emotion,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nrefusing feeling has lead thus here.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nWhere we have now come to live in a world where\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthe most extreme forms of violence,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nthe most horrific poverty,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\ngenocide, mass rapes,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nthe destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd because we have suppressed our girl cells\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand suppressed our girl-ship,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nwe do not feel what is going on.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo, we are not being charged with\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthe adequate response to what is happening.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI want to talk a little bit about\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nFor me, it was the turning point of my life.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nI have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\na lot of violence.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nI essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nBut the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nreally was the turning point in my soul.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nI went and I spent time\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin a place called Bukavu\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nin a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nwith a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nHis name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nIn the Congo, for those of you who don't know,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthere has been a war raging for the last 12 years,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\na war that has killed nearly six million people.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIt is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nhave been raped there.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nWhen I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nI sat with women\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nwho sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nTheir stories were so horrific,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nthat to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I will tell you that what happened\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nis through that shattering,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nlistening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nwho had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nso they had holes, literally, inside them\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwhere their pee and poop came out of them.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nListening to the story of 80-year-old women\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nwho were tied to chains and circled,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nall in the name of economic exploitation\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nto steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nMy mind was so shattered.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut what happened for me is that that shattering\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nactually emboldened me\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nin a way I have never been emboldened.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nThat shattering, that opening of my girl cell,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nthat kind of massive breakthrough of my heart\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nallowed me to become more courageous, and braver,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand actually more clever\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthan I had been in the past in my life.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nI want to say that I think the powers that be\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nknow that empire-building\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nis actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nFeelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand excavating the Earth, and destroying things.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nI remember, for example, when my father,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nwho was very, very violent, used to beat me.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd he would actually say, while he was beating me,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\n\"Don't you cry.

She hid at night.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nShe imagined her father killing her on one hand,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nand Mama Agnes greeting her,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwith the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd when she got to the house she was greeted.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAgnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand Agnes supported her for the year.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nShe went to school and she found her voice,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand she found her identity, and she found her heart.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThen, her time was ready\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nwhen she had to go back to talk to her father\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nabout the reconciliation, after a year.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nI had the privilege of being in the hut\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nwhen she was reunited with her father and reconciled.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nIn that hut, we walked in,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nand her father and his four wives were sitting there,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand her sisters who had just returned because\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nthey had all fled when she had fled,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand her primary mother, who had been beaten\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nin standing up for her with the elders.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhen her father saw her and saw who she had become,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nin her full girl self,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nhe threw his arms around her and broke down crying.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nHe said, \"You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nWe will not cut you.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAnd I give you my word, here and now,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nthat we will not cut your sisters either.\"\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd what she said to him was,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\n\"You were willing to sell me for four cows,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand a calf and some blankets.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nBut I promise you, now that I will be educated\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nI will always take care of you,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nand I will come back and I will build you a house.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nAnd I will be in your corner for the rest of your life.\"\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nFor me, that is the power of girls.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd that is the power of transformation.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nI want to close today\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nwith a new piece from my book.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nAnd I want to do it tonight\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nfor the girl in everybody here.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAnd I want to do it for Sunitha.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nthe girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nBut I really want to do it for each and every person here,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nto value the girl in us,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nto value the part that cries,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nto value the part that's emotional,\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nto value the part that's vulnerable,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nto understand that's where the future lies.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nThis is called \"I'm An Emotional Creature.\"\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nI was asking girls if they like being a girl,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand all the girls were like, \"No, I hate it.

Now imagine what you could place in your hands: an apple, maybe your wallet. Now open your eyes. What about a life?What you see here is a premature baby. He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. Sadly, 20 million babies like this are born every year around the world. Four million of these babies die annually.But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe, long-term health problems. The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow. If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q. Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm.That is the primary function of an incubator. But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to 20 thousand dollars. So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. As a result, parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies, or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here \u2014 methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. I've seen this firsthand over and over again.On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha, who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani. She took her baby to the nearest village clinic, and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. But that hospital was over four hours away, and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there, so her baby died.Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this, my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution, something that could work without electricity, that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use, given that the majority of births still take place in the home. We needed something that was portable, something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost, compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs.So, this is what we came up with. What you see here looks nothing like an incubator. It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. You can open it up completely. It's waterproof. There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily. But the magic is in this pouch of wax. This is a phase-change material. It's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius. You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch. So, you then place it into this little pocket back here, and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby.Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. We plan to launch this product in India in 2010, and the target price point will be 25 dollars, less than 0.1 percent of the cost of a traditional incubator.Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies. But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth. This seems counterintuitive, but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced, population sizes also decrease, because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die. We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology: simple, localized, affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact.In designing this we followed a few basic principles.

And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you, and teaches you that you're very wrong about something that you really believed firmly in. And these are unfortunate moments, because you go to sleep that night dumber than when you woke up. So, that's really the goal of my talk, is to A, communicate that moment to you and B, have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered. So, I hope I can really accomplish that.So, this incident that I'm going to describe really began with some diarrhea. Now, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea. That's why there's a glass of water up there. For us, it's a problem, the people in this room. For babies, it's deadly. They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them. And so, as a result, there is a lot of death, a lot of death. In India in 1960, there was a 24 percent child mortality rate, lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate. One of the big reasons this happened was because of diarrhea. Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem, and there was actually a big solution. This solution has been called, by some, \"potentially the most important medical advance this century.\"Now, the solution turned out to be simple. And what it was was oral rehydration salts. Many of you have probably used this. It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium and glucose together so that when you add it to water the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea. Remarkable impact on mortality. Massive solution to the problem. Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality has dropped to 6.5 percent today.Still a big number, but a big drop. It looks like the technological problem is solved. But if you look, even today there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths in India alone. What's going on here? Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts to those people. That's actually not true. If you look in areas where these salts are completely available, the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated. Maybe there's a biological answer. Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration alone doesn't solve. That's not true either. Many of these deaths were completely preventable, and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing, what I want to call \"the last mile\" problem.See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains \u2014 technological, scientific, hard work, creativity, human ingenuity \u2014 to crack important social problems with technology solutions. That's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years, that's mankind moving forward. But in this case we cracked it, but a big part of the problem still remains. Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well, the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy. Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea. Well, it turns out \u2014 and this is where things get really disconcerting \u2014 it's not unique to diarrhea. It's not even unique to poor people in India. Here's an example from a variety of contexts. I've put a bunch of examples up here.I'll start with insulin, diabetes medication in the U.S. OK, the American population. On Medicaid \u2014 if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid, or if you have health insurance \u2014 insulin is pretty straightforward. You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels. Massive technological advance: took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable. Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day? About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time. As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind, hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year, for something that's solvable.Here I have a bunch of other examples, all suffer from the last mile problem. It's not just medicine. Here's another example from technology: agriculture. We think there's a food problem, so we create new seeds. We think there's an income problem, so we create new ways of farming that increase income. Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked. Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income. Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield when you mix different varieties of rice side by side. Some people are doing that, many are not. What's going on? This is the last mile. The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.Alright, what's the problem? The problem is this little three-pound machine that's behind your eyes and between your ears. This machine is really strange, and one of the consequences is that people are weird. They do lots of inconsistent things. (Applause) They do lots of inconsistent things. And the inconsistencies create, fundamentally, this last mile problem. See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria, the genes, the things inside here, the blood? That's complex, but it's manageable. When we're dealing with people like this? The mind is more complex. That's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.Let me go back to diarrhea for a second. Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey, which is a survey asked of many Indian women: \"Your child has diarrhea. Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?\" Just so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer: It's increase. Now, diarrhea's interesting because it's been around for thousands of years, ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water. One Roman strategy that was very interesting was that \u2014 and it really gave them a comparative advantage \u2014 they made sure their soldiers didn't drink even remotely muddied waters. Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective on the battlefield. So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields, the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.So, here are these women. They've seen their parents have struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea, they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question? In India, 35 to 50 percent say \"Reduce.\" Think about what that means for a second. Thirty-five to 50 percent of women forget oral rehydration therapy, they are increasing \u2014 they are actually making their child more likely to die through their actions. How is that possible? Well, one possibility \u2014 I think that's how most people respond to this \u2014 is to say, \"That's just stupid.\" I don't think that's stupid. I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing. And that is, you don't put water into a leaky bucket.So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake. Just doesn't make sense. Now, the model is intuitively right. It just doesn't happen to be right about the world. But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level. And that, to me, is the fundamental challenge of the last mile.This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge. Convincing people to do something \u2014 take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be \u2014 is not an act of information: \"Let's give them the data, and when they have data they'll do the right thing.\" It's more complex than that. And if you want to understand how it's more complex let me start with something kind of interesting.I'm going to give you a little math problem, and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible. A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Quick. So, somebody out there says, \"Five.\" A lot of you said, \"Ten.\" Let's think about 10 for a second. If the ball costs 10, the bat costs... this is easy, $1.10. Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20. So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people. Most of you look smart. The combination of that produces something that is actually, you got this thing wrong.How is that possible? Let's go to something else. I know algebra can be complicated. So, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade? Let's go back to kindergarten. OK? There's a great show on American television that you have to watch. It's called \"Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\" I think we've learned the answer to that here. Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds. Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen. I just want you to name the color of the object. That's all it is. OK?I want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me, and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you. Ready? Black. Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud. Ready? Go.Audience: Red. Green. Yellow. Blue. Red. (Laughter)Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good. Almost out of kindergarten. What is all this telling us? You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world, some models that you use to understand the world. These models, like the leaky bucket, work well in most situations. I suspect most of you \u2014 I hope that's true for the rest of you \u2014 actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.I found a problem, a specific problem that actually found an error with that. Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that. They are situations where the mental model doesn't match the reality. Same thing here: You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick. You read \"blue\" and you wanted to say \"blue,\" even though you knew your task was red.Now, I do this stuff because it's fun. But it's more profound than fun. I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion. BMW is a pretty safe car. And they are trying to figure out, \"Safety is good. I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?\" \"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.\" But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car, it doesn't look like a Volvo, and it doesn't look like a Hummer.So, what I want you to think about for a few minutes is: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay? So now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task. The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?Here's another puzzle for all of you. One person walks into a car lot, and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris. They are saying, \"This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius, 50 miles per gallon.\" Another person walks into the lot, and they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon, fully loaded, luxury. And they say, \"You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?\" I'm going to do something good for the environment. I'm going to take off some of that weight, and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon.\"Which one of these people has done more for the environment? See, you have a mental model. Fifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on. Turns out, go home and do the math, the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons. Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about gallons per mile. Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency. Miles per gallon is the way we present things.If we want to encourage change of behavior, gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness. Researchers have found these type of anomalies. Okay, back to BMW. What should they do? The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe. This car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe. Here was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign. They showed a BMW driving down the street. There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck. The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.BWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components. You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive, or you can be safe because you avoid accidents. Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it. It harnesses something you already believe. Now, even if I persuaded you to do something, it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result. You all probably intended to wake up, I don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m. This is a battle we all fight every day, along with trying to get to the gym. Now, this is an example of that battle, and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action, and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that. OK?So, let me now talk about the last mile problem. So far, I've been pretty negative. I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior. And I think maybe I'm being too negative. Maybe it's the diarrhea. Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of as the last mile opportunity.Let's go back to diabetes. This is a typical insulin injection. Now, carrying this thing around is complicated. You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe. It's also painful. Now, you may think to yourself, \"Well, if my eyes depended on it, you know, I would obviously use it every day.\" But the pain, the discomfort, you know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip: These are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems. Here is an innovation, a design innovation. This is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded. The needle is particularly sharp. You just gotta carry this thing around. It's much easier to use, much less painful. Anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence, just as a result of this.That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity. You see, we tend to think the problem is solved when we solve the technology problem. But the human innovation, the human problem still remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left. This isn't about the biology of people; this is now about the brains, the psychology of people, and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile.Here's another example of this. This is from a company called Positive Energy. This is about energy efficiency. We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now. What this company does is they send a letter to households that say, \"Here's your energy use, here's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well.\" Smiley face. \"You're doing worse.\" Frown. And what they find is just this letter, nothing else, has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.And you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity, 900 million dollars per year. Why? Because for free, this isn't a new technology, this is a letter \u2014 we're getting a Big Bang in behavior. So, how do we tackle the last mile? I think this tells us there is an opportunity. And I think to tackle it, we need to combine psychology, marketing, art, we've seen that. But you know what we need to combine it with? We need to combine this with the scientific method.See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me, is that the first 999 miles are all about science. No one would say, \"Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it.\" We have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement. But you know what we do on the last mile? \"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there.\" The amount of resources we put in are disparate. We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies. How much are we putting into energy behavior change in a credible, systematic, testing way?Now, I think that we're on the verge of something big. We're on the verge of a whole new social science. It's a social science that recognizes \u2014 much like science recognizes the complexity of the body, biology recognizes the complexity of the body \u2014 we'll recognize the complexity of the human mind. The careful testing, retesting, design, are going to open up vistas of understanding, complexities, difficult things. And those vistas will both create new science, and fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years. All right. Thank you very much. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much. So, this whole area is so fascinating. I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically, what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time. How much is your field talking to great marketers about their insights into human psychology? Because they've seen it on the ground.Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers, and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say, there are insights to be gleaned there. Forty percent of it is about what marketing is. Marketing is selling an ad to a firm. So, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about convincing a CEO, \"This is a good ad campaign.\" So, there is a little bit of slippage there. That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign. And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually measure effectiveness? Are we effective?CA: How you take your insights here and actually get them integrated into working business models on the ground, in Indian villages, for example?SM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important. We work closely with companies that have operational capacity, or nonprofits that have operational capacity. And then we say, \"Well, you want to get this behavior change. Let's come up with a few ideas, test them, see which is working, go back, synthesize, and try to come up with a thing that works,\" and then we're able to scale with partners. It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts. If you have biological problems we try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale.CA: Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

This is incredibly unfortunate.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nOne of the big reasons this happened was\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nbecause of diarrhea.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nNow, there was a big effort to solve this problem,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand there was actually a big solution.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nThis solution has been called, by some,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\n\"potentially the most important medical\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nadvance this century.\"\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nNow, the solution turned out to be simple.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nAnd what it was was oral rehydration salts.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nMany of you have probably used this.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nIt's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nand glucose together so that when you add it to water\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nthe child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nRemarkable impact on mortality.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nMassive solution to the problem.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nFlash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nhas dropped to 6.5 percent today.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nStill a big number, but a big drop.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nIt looks like the technological problem is solved.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nBut if you look, even today\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nthere are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nin India alone.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nWhat's going on here?\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nWell the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nto those people.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nThat's actually not true.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nIf you look in areas where these salts are completely available,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nthe price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nMaybe there's a biological answer.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nMaybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nalone doesn't solve. That's not true either.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nMany of these deaths were completely preventable,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nand this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nwhat I want to call \"the last mile\" problem.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSee, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains --\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\ntechnological, scientific, hard work,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\ncreativity, human ingenuity --\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nto crack important social problems with technology solutions.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThat's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat's mankind moving forward.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nBut in this case we cracked it,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nbut a big part of the problem still remains.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthe last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nNow, that's for oral rehydration therapy.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nMaybe this is something unique about diarrhea.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nWell, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nit's not unique to diarrhea.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nIt's not even unique to poor people in India.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nHere's an example from a variety of contexts.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nI've put a bunch of examples up here.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI'll start with insulin, diabetes\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nmedication in the U.S.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nOK, the American population.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nOn Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nor if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nYou get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nyou have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nMassive technological advance:\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\ntook an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAdherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAbout on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAs a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nhundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nfor something that's solvable.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nHere I have a bunch of other examples,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nall suffer from the last mile problem.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nIt's not just medicine.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nHere's another example from technology:\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nagriculture. We think\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthere's a food problem, so we create new seeds.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWe think there's an income problem, so we create\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nnew ways of farming that increase income.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWell, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nIntercropping. Intercropping really increases income.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nwhen you mix different varieties of rice side by side.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSome people are doing that,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nmany are not. What's going on?\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThis is the last mile.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThe last mile is, everywhere, problematic.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAlright, what's the problem?\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThe problem is this little three-pound machine\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nthat's behind your eyes and between your ears.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThis machine is really strange,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand one of the consequences is that people are weird.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey do lots of inconsistent things.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nThey do lots of inconsistent things.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAnd the inconsistencies\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\ncreate, fundamentally, this last mile problem.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nSee, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthe genes, the things inside here, the blood?\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThat's complex, but it's manageable.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nWhen we're dealing with people like this?\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThe mind is more complex.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThat's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nLet me go back to diarrhea for a second.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nHere's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nwhich is a survey asked of many Indian women:\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\n\"Your child has diarrhea.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nShould you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?\"\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nJust so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nIt's increase.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nNow, diarrhea's interesting\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nbecause it's been around for thousands of years,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\never since humankind really\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nlived side by side enough to have really polluted water.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nOne Roman strategy that was very interesting\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nwas that -- and it really gave them a comparative advantage --\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthey made sure their soldiers didn't drink\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\neven remotely muddied waters.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nBecause if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\non the battlefield.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSo, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nthe breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo, here are these women. They've seen their parents\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nhave struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nthey've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nIn India, 35 to 50 percent say \"Reduce.\"\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThink about what that means for a second.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nThirty-five to 50 percent of women\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nforget oral rehydration therapy,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nthey are increasing --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nthey are actually making their child\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nmore likely to die through their actions.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nHow is that possible?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWell, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nis to say, \"That's just stupid.\"\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nI don't think that's stupid.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd that is, you don't put water\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\ninto a leaky bucket.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nJust doesn't make sense.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nNow, the model is intuitively right.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nIt just doesn't happen to be right about the world.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd that, to me, is the fundamental challenge\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nof the last mile.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThis first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nConvincing people to do something --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\ntake oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be --\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nis not an act of information:\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\n\"Let's give them the data,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand when they have data they'll do the right thing.\"\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nIt's more complex than that.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd if you want to understand how it's more complex\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nlet me start with something kind of interesting.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nI'm going to give you a little math problem,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nA bat and a ball together cost $1.10.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThe bat costs a dollar more than the ball.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nHow much does the ball cost? Quick.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nSo, somebody out there says, \"Five.\"\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nA lot of you said, \"Ten.\"\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nLet's think about 10 for a second.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nIf the ball costs 10, the bat costs...\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthis is easy, $1.10.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nYeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nSo, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nMost of you look smart.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nThe combination of that produces\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nsomething that is actually, you got this thing wrong.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nHow is that possible? Let's go to something else.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nI know algebra can be complicated.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nLet's go back to kindergarten. OK?\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nThere's a great show on American television that you have to watch.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIt's called \"Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\"\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nI think we've learned the answer to that here.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nLet's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nHere's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nI just want you to name the color of the object.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThat's all it is. OK?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nI want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nReady? Black.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nNow the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nReady? Go.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAudience: Red. Green.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nYellow. Blue. Red.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nSendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAlmost out of kindergarten.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nWhat is all this telling us?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nYou see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nis that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nsome models that you use to understand the world.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThese models, like the leaky bucket,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwork well in most situations.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nI suspect most of you --\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nI hope that's true for the rest of you --\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nactually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nI found a problem, a specific problem\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthat actually found an error with that.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nDiarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThey are situations where the mental model\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\ndoesn't match the reality.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSame thing here:\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nYou read \"blue\" and you wanted to say \"blue,\" even though you knew your task was red.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nNow, I do this stuff because it's fun.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nBut it's more profound than fun.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nI'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nBMW is a pretty safe car.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd they are trying to figure out, \"Safety is good.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nI want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?\"\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\n\"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nit doesn't look like a Volvo,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand it doesn't look like a Hummer.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nSo, what I want you to think about for a few minutes\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nis: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nSo now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThe second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nHere's another puzzle for all of you.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nOne person walks into a car lot,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThey are saying, \"This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nthe environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\n50 miles per gallon.\"\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnother person walks into the lot,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nfully loaded, luxury.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd they say, \"You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?\"\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nI'm going to do something good for the environment.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nI'm going to take off some of that weight,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nand I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon.\"\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nWhich one of these people has done more for the environment?\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nSee, you have a mental model.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nFifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nTurns out, go home and do the math,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthe nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nWhy? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\ngallons per mile.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nThink about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nMiles per gallon is the way we present things.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIf we want to encourage change of behavior,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\ngallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nResearchers have found these type of anomalies.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nOkay, back to BMW. What should they do?\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThe problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThis car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nHere was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nThey showed a BMW driving down the street.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThere's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThe car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nBWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nYou can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nor you can be safe because you avoid accidents.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nRemarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nIt harnesses something you already believe.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nNow, even if I persuaded you to do something,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nit's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou all probably intended to wake up,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nI don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThis is a battle we all fight every day,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nalong with trying to get to the gym.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nNow, this is an example of that battle,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nand so one of the fundamental challenges\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nis how we would actually do that. OK?\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nSo, let me now talk about the last mile problem.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo far, I've been pretty negative.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nI've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd I think maybe I'm being too negative.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nMaybe it's the diarrhea.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nMaybe the last mile problem really should be thought of\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nas the last mile opportunity.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nLet's go back to diabetes.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nThis is a typical insulin injection.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nNow, carrying this thing around is complicated.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nYou gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's also painful.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nNow, you may think to yourself, \"Well, if my eyes depended on it,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nyou know, I would obviously use it every day.\"\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nBut the pain, the discomfort,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nyou know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nwhen you go on a long trip:\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThese are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nHere is an innovation, a design innovation.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThis is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nThe needle is particularly sharp.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nYou just gotta carry this thing around.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nIt's much easier to use, much less painful.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nAnywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\njust as a result of this.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThat's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nYou see, we tend to think the problem is solved\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nwhen we solve the technology problem.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nBut the human innovation, the human problem\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nstill remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThis isn't about the biology of people;\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthis is now about the brains, the psychology of people,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nand innovation needs to continue all the way through\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthe last mile.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nHere's another example of this.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nThis is from a company called Positive Energy.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nThis is about energy efficiency.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nWe're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nWhat this company does is they send a letter\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nto households that say, \"Here's your energy use,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nhere's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well.\" Smiley face.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\n\"You're doing worse.\" Frown.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd what they find is just this letter, nothing else,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nhas a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd you want to think about the social value of that\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nin terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\n900 million dollars per year.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nWhy? Because for free,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthis isn't a new technology, this is a letter --\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nwe're getting a Big Bang in behavior.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSo, how do we tackle the last mile?\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nI think this tells us there is an opportunity.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nAnd I think to tackle it, we need to combine\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\npsychology,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nmarketing,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nart, we've seen that.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nBut you know what we need to combine it with?\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWe need to combine this with the scientific method.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nSee what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nis that the first 999 miles are all about science.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nNo one would say, \"Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it.\"\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nWe have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nBut you know what we do on the last mile?\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\n\"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there.\"\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nThe amount of resources we put in are disparate.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nWe put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nHow much are we putting into\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nenergy behavior change\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nin a credible, systematic, testing way?\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nNow, I think that we're on the verge of something big.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWe're on the verge of a whole new social science.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nIt's a social science that recognizes --\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nmuch like science recognizes the complexity of the body,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nbiology recognizes the complexity of the body -- we'll recognize\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nthe complexity of the human mind.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nThe careful testing, retesting, design,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nare going to open up vistas of understanding,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ncomplexities, difficult things.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nAnd those vistas will both create new science,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAll right. Thank you very much.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nChris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nSo, this whole area is so fascinating.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nI mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthat they are kind of putting into place\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nacademically, what great marketers\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nhave sort of intuitively known for a long time.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nHow much is your field talking to great marketers\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nabout their insights into human psychology?\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nBecause they've seen it on the ground.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nSendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthere are insights to be gleaned there.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nForty percent of it is about what marketing is.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nMarketing is selling an ad to a firm.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nconvincing a CEO, \"This is a good ad campaign.\"\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nSo, there is a little bit of slippage there.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nThat's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nAnd one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nmeasure effectiveness? Are we effective?\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nCA: How you take your insights here\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nand actually get them integrated\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\ninto working business models on the ground,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nin Indian villages, for example?\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nSM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nWe work closely with companies that have operational capacity,\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nor nonprofits that have operational capacity.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nAnd then we say, \"Well, you want to get this behavior change.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nLet's come up with a few ideas, test them,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nsee which is working, go back, synthesize,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nand try to come up with a thing that works,\"\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nand then we're able to scale with partners.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nIt's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nIf you have biological problems\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nwe try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nCA: Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:51.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The big idea my brother inspired", "duration": "1014", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_heywood_the_big_idea_my_brother_inspired", "transcript": "When my brother called me in December of 1998, he said, \"The news does not look good.\" This is him on the screen. He'd just been diagnosed with ALS, which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years. It paralyzes you. It starts by killing the motor neurons in your spinal cord. And you go from being a healthy, robust 29-year-old male to someone that cannot breathe, cannot move, cannot speak.This has actually been, to me, a gift, because we began a journey to learn a new way of thinking about life. And even though Steven passed away three years ago we had an amazing journey as a family. We did not even \u2014 I think adversity is not even the right word. We looked at this and we said, \"We're going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way.\" And I want to talk today about one of the things that we decided to do, which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare. Because, as we all know here today, it doesn't work very well. I want to talk about it in the context of a story.This is the story of my brother. But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story, and go to something more. \"Given my status, what is the best outcome I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?\" is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do. And those questions all have variables to them. All of our statuses are different. All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish, is different, and our paths will be different, they are all stories.But it's a story until we convert it to data and so what we do, this concept we had, was to take Steven's status, \"What is my status?\" and go from this concept of walking, breathing, and then his hands, speak, and ultimately happiness and function. So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man on his icon, but the rest of them are really what's important here. Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed, as he was in that pool, he could not walk, he could not use his arms \u2014 that's why he had the little floaty things on them, did you see those? \u2014 he was happy. We were at the beach, he was raising his son, and he was productive.And we took this, and we converted it into data. But it's not a data point at that one moment in time. It is a data point of Steven in a context. Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy, as a builder: taller, stronger, got all the women, amazing guy. Here he is walking down the aisle, but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired. And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes, can't feed himself. And here he is, paralyzed completely, unable to breathe and move, over this time journey. These stories of his life, converted to data. He renovated my carriage house when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak, and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.So, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world. And this is the insight, the thing that we are excited about, because we have gone away from the community that we are, the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other. We need to give to others to be successful. So, Steven is sharing this story, but he is not alone. There are so many other people sharing their stories. Not stories in words, but stories in data and words. And we convert that information into this structure, this understanding, this ability to convert those stories into something that is computable, to which we can begin to change the way medicine is done and delivered.We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression, Parkinson's disease, HIV. These are not simple, they are not internet scalable; they require thought and processes to find the meaningful information about the disease. So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website. And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me, the company that myself, my youngest brother and a good friend from MIT started.Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now, sharing their stories as data. Here is an M.S. patient. His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired on cognition, vision, walking, sensation. Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient. Each of them can have a different characteristic. You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression. Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny. It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there. But he is working to keep his CD4 count high and his viral level low so he can make his life better.But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments. Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone. These are patients currently on drugs, sharing data. I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer. Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer. What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems. These are why people pray. Here is the schedule of how frequently they \u2014 it's a dose. So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day, and see if they're doing better, they probably are. Here they are. It's an open network, everybody is sharing. We can see it all.Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety. And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now. How they treat it, the drugs, the components of it, their side effects, all of it in a rich environment, and you can drill down and see the individuals. This amazing data allows us to drill down and see what this drug is for \u2014 1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes. I want to talk to the 58 patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day. And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years. So, you can see the duration. All open, all available. I'm going to log in.And this is my brother's profile. And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now. This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash. And you can see here, as this animates over, Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients, against this information. The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile, that he has non-genetic ALS. You scroll down in this profile and you can see all of his prescription drugs, but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively. Wait, poor spinal capacity.Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program? Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money? Detrol. In the side effects for his drug, integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had, the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.I love here \u2014 the cyberkinetics implant, which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available. You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms. You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS. So, you click down on the ALS tab there. I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental. I can look at my constipation, how to manage it. I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects from that drug all integrated in the time in which they're meaningful.But I want more. I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this data and make something even better. I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms and his drugs, and all of the things that interact among those, the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy that we can look at in any way we want to understand it, so that we can take this information and go beyond just this simple model of what a record is.I don't even know what a medical record is. I want to solve a problem. I want an application. So, can I take this data \u2014 rearrange yourself, put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top, tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else, and what interacts. Years after he's had these drugs, I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva, including some positive side effects that came from other drugs, were making his constipation worse. And if anyone's ever had severe constipation, and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life \u2014 yes, that was a pun.You're trying to manage these, and this grid is available here, and we want to understand it. No one's ever had this kind of information. So, patients have this. We're for patients. This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network. This is about the patients. So, how can we take this and bring them a tool that they can go back and they can engage the medical system? And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said, \"What's something we can use all the time, that we can use in the medical care system, that everyone will understand?\"So, the patients print it out, because hospitals usually block us because they believe we are a social network. It's actually the most used feature on the website. Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged. So, we went from this story of Steven and his history to data, and then back to paper, where we went back and engaged the medical care system. And here's another paper. This is a journal, PNAS \u2014 I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America. You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done. This is a report about a drug called lithium. Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder, that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.Now, we'll skip the critiques of the paper. But the short story is: If you're a patient, you want to be on the blue line. You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line. Because the blue line is a better line. The red line is way downhill, the blue line is a good line. So, you know we said \u2014 we looked at this, and what I love also is that people always accuse these Internet sites of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly. So, this is what happened when PNAS published this. Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium. Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data in a bad publication. And they call the Internet irresponsible. Here's the implication of what happens.There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil, who unfortunately passed away nine months ago, who said, \"Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question? Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years. I want to know now. Can you help us?\" So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels. We let them share the data and exchange it. You know, a data network. And they said, you know, \"Jamie, PLM, can you guys tell us whether this works or not?\" And we went around and we talked to people, and they said, \"You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know? You don't have the blinding, you don't have data, it doesn't follow the scientific method. It's never going to work. You can't do it.\"So, I said, \"Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder.\" (Laughter) I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients, but I can say whether it works in Humberto. I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over, and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine that came in Leopard. And we said \u2014 because it's really cool, you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer, and find everything you've lost, and I loved it. And I said, \"What if we built a time machine for patients, except instead of going backwards, we go forwards. Can we find out what's going to happen to you, so that you can maybe change it?\"So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto, That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time to build our own. This is a real app by the way. This is not just graphics. And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring their data together. And we bring their histories into it. And then we say, \"Well how do we line them all up?\" So, we line them all up so they go together around the meaningful points, integrated across everything we know about the patient. Full information, the entire course of their disease. And that's what is going to happen to Humberto, unless he does something. And he took lithium, and he went down the line. And it works almost every time.Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting. But almost all the time it works. It's actually scary. It's beautiful. So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out. But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto. And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later. But here is the answer of the mean of the patients that actually decided to take lithium. These are all the patients that started lithium. It's the Intent to Treat Curve. You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones, those are the people in the study in PNAS that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones, the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be. And the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of lithium at time zero, going forward, and then going backward.So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly. Terrifyingly accurate matching. And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time. You're actually doing slightly worse \u2014 not significantly, but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time. But you know, a lot of people dropped out, the trial, there is too much drop out. Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium, because they were so convinced they were getting better?We asked our control algorithm, are those 69 patients \u2014 by the way, you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial \u2014 can we look at those patients and say, \"Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them, and what happens?\" Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly. Those little lines? That's the power.So, we \u2014 I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper \u2014 I can tell you that for those 69 people that took lithium, they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them, just like me, and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study. We did that one year ahead of the time when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH for millions of dollars failed for futility last week, and announced it.So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant. I never really knew whether it worked. And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna, in his lumbar cord, and filled out the IRBs and did all this work, and I never really knew. How did I not know? I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him. I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group \u2014 we actually searched for about a year to find someone who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry. And there are these guys who used to model the future of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff. And some of them were available. So, we hired one. (Laughter)We hired them, set them up, assisting at lab. I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him, is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said, \"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant worked or not?\" And he sent me this two days ago. It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time? We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened. Because something went different. But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line. It only works about 12 months.It's the first version of the time machine. First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later but 12 months so far. And, you know, I look at this, and I get really emotional. You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls, you can look at them, you can ask them. And I found a woman that had \u2014 we found her, she was odd because she had data after she died. And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores, because he knew how much she cared. And I am thankful.I can't believe that these people, years after my brother had died, helped me answer the question about whether an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on years ago, worked or not. I wished it had been there when I'd done it the first time, and I'm really excited that it's here now, because the lab that I founded has some data on a drug that might work, and I'd like to show it. I'd like to show it in real time, now, and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for. I've got to thank the 45,000 people that are doing this social experiment with us. There is an amazing journey we are going on to become human again, to be part of community again, to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable, and it's very exciting. So, thank you.

It starts by killing\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nthe motor neurons in your spinal cord.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd you go from being a healthy,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nrobust 29-year-old male\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nto someone that cannot breathe,\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\ncannot move, cannot speak.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThis has actually been, to me, a gift,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nbecause we began a journey\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nto learn a new way of thinking about life.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd even though Steven passed away three years ago\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nwe had an amazing journey as a family.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nWe did not even --\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nI think adversity is not even the right word.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nWe looked at this and we said, \"We're going to do something with this\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nin an incredibly positive way.\"\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd I want to talk today\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nabout one of the things that we decided to do,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwhich was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nBecause, as we all know here today,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nit doesn't work very well.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nI want to talk about it in the context of a story.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nThis is the story of my brother.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nBut it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand go to something more.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\n\"Given my status, what is the best outcome\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nI can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?\"\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nis what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd those questions all have variables to them.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAll of our statuses are different.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nAll of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nis different, and our paths will be different,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthey are all stories.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nBut it's a story until we convert it to data\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand so what we do, this concept we had,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nwas to take Steven's status, \"What is my status?\"\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nand go from this concept of walking, breathing,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nand then his hands, speak,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nand ultimately happiness and function.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nSo, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\non his icon,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nbut the rest of them are really what's important here.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nBecause Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nas he was in that pool, he could not walk,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nhe could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\ndid you see those? --\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nhe was happy. We were at the beach,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nhe was raising his son, and he was productive.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nAnd we took this, and we converted it into data.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nBut it's not a data point at that one moment in time.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nIt is a data point of Steven in a context.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nHere he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nas a builder: taller, stronger,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\ngot all the women, amazing guy.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nHere he is walking down the aisle,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\ncan't feed himself.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd here he is, paralyzed completely,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nunable to breathe and move, over this time journey.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThese stories of his life, converted to data.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nHe renovated my carriage house\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwhen he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nSo, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd this is the insight, the thing that we are\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nexcited about,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nbecause we have gone away from the community that we are,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nthe fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWe need to give to others to be successful.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nSo, Steven is sharing this story,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nbut he is not alone.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nThere are so many other people sharing their stories.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nNot stories in words, but stories in data and words.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd we convert that information into this structure,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthis understanding, this ability to convert\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nthose stories into something that is computable,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nto which we can begin to change the way\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nmedicine is done and delivered.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWe did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nParkinson's disease, HIV.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThese are not simple, they are not internet scalable;\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthey require thought and processes\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nto find the meaningful information about the disease.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nSo, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthe company that myself, my youngest brother\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nand a good friend from MIT started.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nHere are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nsharing their stories as data.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nHere is an M.S. patient.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nHis name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\non cognition, vision, walking, sensation.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThose are things that are different for each M.S. patient.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nEach of them can have a different characteristic.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nYou can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nLook at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nIt's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nBut he is working to keep his CD4 count high\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nand his viral level low so he can make his life better.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nBut you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nLook at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nThese are patients currently on drugs,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nsharing data.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nI love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\non prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nWhat I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThese are why people pray.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nHere is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand see if they're doing better, they probably are.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nHere they are. It's an open network,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\neverybody is sharing. We can see it all.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nOr, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nHow they treat it,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthe drugs, the components of it,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\ntheir side effects, all of it in a rich environment,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand you can drill down and see the individuals.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nThis amazing data allows us to drill down and see\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nwhat this drug is for --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\n1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nI want to talk to the 58 patients down here\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nwho are taking four milligrams a day.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nit for more than two years.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nSo, you can see the duration.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAll open, all available.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nI'm going to log in.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd this is my brother's profile.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThis is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd you can see here, as this animates over,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSteven's actual data against the background of all other patients,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nagainst this information.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThe blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nthat he has non-genetic ALS.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nYou scroll down in this profile and you can see\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nall of his prescription drugs,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nbut more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nWait, poor spinal capacity.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nDoesn't this remind you of a great stock program?\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nWouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwas as good as the technology we use to make money?\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nDetrol. In the side effects for his drug,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nintegrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nthe first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nI love here -- the cyberkinetics implant,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nwhich was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nYou can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nYou can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo, you click down on the ALS tab there.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nI can look at my constipation, how to manage it.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nI can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nfrom that drug all integrated in the time\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nin which they're meaningful.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nBut I want more.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nI don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\ndata and make something even better.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nI want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand his drugs,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand all of the things that interact among those,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthe side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthat we can look at in any way we want to understand it,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nso that we can take this information\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand go beyond just this simple model\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nof what a record is.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI don't even know what a medical record is.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI want to solve a problem. I want an application.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nSo, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nput the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\ntell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand what interacts.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nYears after he's had these drugs,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nI learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nincluding some positive side effects that came from other drugs,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwere making his constipation worse.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd if anyone's ever had severe constipation,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nand you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nyes, that was a pun.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nYou're trying to manage these,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nand this grid is available here,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nand we want to understand it.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nNo one's ever had this kind of information.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nSo, patients have this. We're for patients.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThis is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nThis is about the patients.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nSo, how can we take this and bring them a tool\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat they can go back and they can engage the medical system?\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\n\"What's something we can use all the time,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthat we can use in the medical care system,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthat everyone will understand?\"\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nSo, the patients print it out,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbecause hospitals usually block us\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nbecause they believe we are a social network.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nIt's actually the most used feature on the website.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nDoctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nSo, we went from this story of Steven\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand his history to data, and then back to paper,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nwhere we went back and engaged the medical care system.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd here's another paper.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThis is a journal, PNAS --\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nof the United States of America.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nYou've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthe amazing things they've done.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nThis is a report about a drug called lithium.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nLithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthat a group in Italy found\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nslowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nNow, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nBut the short story is: If you're a patient,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nyou want to be on the blue line.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nYou don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nBecause the blue line is a better line. The red line\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nis way downhill, the blue line is a good line.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nSo, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nis that people always accuse these Internet sites\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nof promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo, this is what happened when PNAS published this.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nTen percent of the people in our system took lithium.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nTen percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nin a bad publication.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nAnd they call the Internet irresponsible.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nHere's the implication of what happens.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nThere's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwho unfortunately passed away nine months ago,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwho said, \"Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nBecause I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nI want to know now. Can you help us?\"\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nSo, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nWe let them share the data and exchange it.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nYou know, a data network.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd they said, you know, \"Jamie, PLM,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\ncan you guys tell us whether this works or not?\"\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd we went around and we talked to people,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand they said, \"You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nYou don't have the blinding, you don't have data,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nit doesn't follow the scientific method.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nIt's never going to work. You can't do it.\"\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo, I said, \"Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder.\"\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nI can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nbut I can say whether it works in Humberto.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nI bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nand I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthat came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nyou can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand find everything you've lost, and I loved it.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd I said, \"What if we built a time machine for patients,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nexcept instead of going backwards, we go forwards.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nCan we find out what's going to happen to you,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nso that you can maybe change it?\"\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nSo, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThat's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto build our own. This is a real app by the way.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nThis is not just graphics.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\ntheir data together. And we bring their histories into it.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd then we say, \"Well how do we line them all up?\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nSo, we line them all up so they go together\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\naround the meaningful points,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nintegrated across everything we know about the patient.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nFull information, the entire course of their disease.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd that's what is going to happen to Humberto,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nunless he does something.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd he took lithium, and he went down the line.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd it works almost every time.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nNow, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nBut almost all the time it works.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIt's actually scary. It's beautiful.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nSo, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nBut we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nAnd yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nBut here is the answer\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nof the mean of the patients that actually decided\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nto take lithium.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThese are all the patients that started lithium.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nIt's the Intent to Treat Curve.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nYou can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nthose are the people in the study in PNAS\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthat you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nthe pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAnd the ones in the middle are all of our patients\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nfrom the start of lithium at time zero,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ngoing forward, and then going backward.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nSo, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nTerrifyingly accurate matching.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nYou're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbut slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nBut you know, a lot of people dropped out,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthe trial, there is too much drop out.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nCan we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthat actually decided to stay on lithium,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nbecause they were so convinced they were getting better?\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe asked our control algorithm,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nare those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthat's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\ncan we look at those patients and say,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\n\"Can we match them with our time machine\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nto the other patients that are just like them,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand what happens?\"\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nEven the ones that believed they were getting better\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nmatched the controls exactly. Exactly.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nThose little lines? That's the power.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nthat if you did it at a higher dose\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nor if you run the study proper -- I can tell you\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat for those 69 people that took lithium,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthey didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\njust like me,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand that we had the power to detect that at about\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\na quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nWe did that one year ahead of the time\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nwhen the first clinical trial funded by the NIH\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nfor millions of dollars failed for futility last week,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand announced it.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nSo, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI never really knew whether it worked.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nin his lumbar cord,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand filled out the IRBs and did all this work,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand I never really knew.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nHow did I not know?\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nI actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwe actually searched for about a year to find someone\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nwho could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nin healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd there are these guys who used to model the future\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nof interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd some of them were available. So, we hired one.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nWe hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nis like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\n\"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nworked or not?\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd he sent me this two days ago.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIt was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nWe have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nBecause something went different.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nBut my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nIt only works about 12 months.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIt's the first version of the time machine.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nFirst time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nbut 12 months so far.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nAnd, you know, I look at this,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nand I get really emotional.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nYou look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nyou can look at them, you can ask them.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd I found a woman that had --\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nwe found her, she was odd because she had data\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nafter she died.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nAnd her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nbecause he knew how much she cared.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nAnd I am thankful.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nI can't believe that these people,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nyears after my brother had died,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nhelped me answer the question about whether\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nan operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nyears ago, worked or not.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nI wished it had been there\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nwhen I'd done it the first time,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nand I'm really excited that it's here now,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nbecause the lab that I founded\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nhas some data on a drug that might work,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nand I'd like to show it.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nI'd like to show it in real time, now,\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nI've got to thank the 45,000 people\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthat are doing this social experiment with us.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nThere is an amazing journey we are going on\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nto become human again,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nto be part of community again,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nto share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nand it's very exciting.

How do you do that? And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you, I want to suggest to you, is one in which you say that in order to treat disease, you have to first know what you're treating, that's diagnostics, and then you have to do something.The program we're involved in is something we call \"Diagnostics for All,\" or \"zero-cost diagnostics.\" How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost? How do you do it? Let me just give you two examples. The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world: poor resources, a rigorous environment \u2014 a series of problems \u2014 light weight and things of this kind. And also they're not so different from the home health care and diagnostic system world.So, the technology I want to talk about is for the third world, for the developing world, but it has, I think, much broader application, because information is so important in the health care system. So you see two examples here. One is a lab that is actually a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa. The second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what at a table in a market. I don't know what kind of health care is delivered there. But it's not really what is probably most efficient.What is our approach? The way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost, starting from the perspective of the United States, is to take our solution, and then try to cut cost out of it. No matter how you do that, you're not going to start with a $100,000 instrument and bring it down to no cost. It isn't going to work.So the approach we took was the other way around, to ask: What is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of, and get useful information and add function? And what we've chosen is paper. What you see here is a prototypic device. It's about a centimeter on the side. It's about the size of a fingernail. The lines around the edges are a polymer. It's made of paper. And paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth \u2014 drop wine on the tablecloth, and the wine wicks all over everything. Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt. That's what a hydrophilic surface does.So in this device, the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of, in this case, urine. The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top. The brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine, the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine. And the combination of those two is a first-order shot at a number of useful things that you want. So, this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper.Now, how simple can you make the production? Why do we choose paper? There's an example of the same thing on a finger, showing you basically what it looks like. One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere. We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps, and all kinds of stuff.So the production capability is there. The second is, you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place. I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like 100,000 tests, something of that kind.And then finally, a point you don't think of so much in developed world medicine: it eliminates sharps. And what sharps means is needles, things that stick. If you've taken a sample of someone's blood and the someone might have hepatitis C, you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you. You don't want to do that. So how do you dispose of that? It's a problem everywhere, and here, you simply burn it. So it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things.Now, you say, \"If paper is a good idea, other people have surely thought of it.\" And the answer is, of course, yes. Those half of you, roughly, who are women, at some point may have had a pregnancy test. And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left. It's something called a lateral-flow immunoassay. In that particular test, urine, either containing a hormone called hCG, does or does not flow across a piece of paper. And there are two bars; one bar indicates that the test is working, and if the second bar shows up, you're pregnant.This is a terrific kind of test in a binary world, and the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant; you're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort. So it works very well there, but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information.There are also dipsticks, but if you look at the dipsticks, they're for another kind of urine analysis. There are an awful lot of colors and things like that. What do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance? So the approach we started with is to ask: Is it really practical to make things of this sort? And that problem is now, in a purely engineering way, solved. And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper. You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer. The wax printer does what looks like printing. It is printing. You put that on, you warm it a little bit, the wax prints through, so it absorbs into the paper, and you end up with the device you want.The printers cost 800 bucks now. We estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day, they'd make about 10 million tests a year. So it's a solved problem. That particular problem is solved. And there is an example of the kind of thing that you see. That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper. That takes about two seconds to make. And so I regard that as done. There's a very important issue here, which is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors. That's what color printers do. I'll show you in a moment, that's actually quite useful.Now, the next question that you would like to ask is: What would you like to measure? What would you like to analyze? And the thing you'd most like to analyze, we're a fair distance from. It's what's called \"fever of undiagnosed origin.\" Someone comes into the clinic, they have a fever, they feel bad. What do they have? Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS? Do they have a common cold? The triage problem. That's a hard problem for reasons I won't go through. There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among. But then there are a series of things \u2014 AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others \u2014 and simpler ones, such as guidance of treatment.Now, even that's more complicated than you think. A friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry, and he is interested in the question of why people do and don't take their meds. So Dapsone, or something like that, you have to take for a while. He has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India and saying, \"Have you taken your Dapsone?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have you taken it every day?\" \"Yes.\" \"Have you taken if for a month?\" \"Yes.\" What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog that morning.(Laughter)And he was telling the truth, because in a different culture, the dog is a surrogate for you; \"today,\" \"this month,\" \"since the rainy season\" \u2014 there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding.(Laughter)And so an issue here is to, in some cases, figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting, like compliance.Now, take a look at what a typical test looks like. Prick a finger, you get some blood \u2014 about 50 microliters. That's about all you're going to get, because you can't use the usual sort of systems. You can't manipulate it very well; I'll show something about that in a moment. So you take the drop of blood, no further manipulations, you put it on a little device, the device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through, and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there. And the colors indicate \"disease\" or \"normal.\" But even that's complicated, because to me, colors might indicate \"normal,\" but after all, we're all suffering from probably an excess of education.What do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis? And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there, and at this point, there is a dramatic flourish, and out comes the universal solution to everything these days, which is a cell phone \u2014 in this particular case, a camera phone. They're everywhere \u2014 six billion a month in India. And the idea is that what one does is to take the device, you dip it, you develop the color, you take a picture, the picture goes to a central laboratory. You don't have to send out a doctor, you send out somebody who can just take the sample, and in the clinic either a doctor, or ideally, a computer in this case, does the analysis. Turns out to work actually quite well, particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work.So my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old, otherwise unemployed, who has two things: a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample, and an AK-47. And these are the things that get him through his day.(Laughter)There's another very interesting connection here, and that is, that what one wants to do is pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system. It turns out there's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject, which is the Mars Rover problem. How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with? And the answer is not complicated, but it's one which I don't want to go through here, other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood.Also, a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer. This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped. I don't know whether the idea of one computer, one child makes any sense. Here's the computer of the future, because this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous.All right, let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices. And we'll start by posing a little problem. What you see here is another centimeter-sized device, and the different colors are different colors of dye. And you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting, which is, the yellow seems to disappear, get through the blue, and then get through the red. How does that happen? How do you make something flow through something? And, of course the answer is, \"You don't.\" You make it flow under and over.But now the question is: How do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper? The answer is that what you do \u2014 and the details are not terribly important here \u2014 is to make something more elaborate: You take several different layers of paper, each one containing its own little fluid system, and you separate them by pieces of, literally, double-sided carpet tape, the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor. And the fluid will flow from one layer into the next. It distributes itself, flows through further holes, distributes itself.And what you see, at the lower right-hand side there, is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top, and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom, in a piece of paper \u2014 basically, it looks like a chip, two pieces of paper thick. And in this particular case, we were just interested in the replicability of that. But that is, in principle, the way you solve the \"fever of unexplained origin\" problem, because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease, and this will work in due course.Here is an example of a slightly more complicated device. There's the chip. You dip in a corner. The fluid goes into the center. It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color, all done with paper and carpet tape. So it's, I think, as low-cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things.Now, I have two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business. This is one: One of the things you occasionally need to do is separate blood cells from serum. And the question was, here we do it by taking a sample, we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it, and you get blood cells out. Terrific. What happens if you don't have electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever? And we thought for a while of how you might do this, and the way, in fact, you do it, is what's shown here. You get an eggbeater, which is everywhere, and you saw off a blade, and then you take tubing, and you stick it on that. You put the blood in, somebody sits there and spins it. It works really, really well.And we sat down, we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing, and sent it off to a journal. We were very proud of this, particularly the title, which was \"Eggbeater as Centrifuge.\"(Laughter)And we sent it off, and by return mail, it came back. I called up the editor and I said, \"What's going on? How is this possible?\" The editor said, with enormous disdain, \"I read this. And we're not going to publish it, because we only publish science.\"(Laughter)And it's an important issue, because it means that we have to, as a society, think about what we value. And if it's just papers and Phys. Rev. letters, we've got a problem.Here is another example of something which is \u2014 this is a little spectrophotometer. It measures the absorption of light in a sample. The neat thing about this is, you have a light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz, another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz, and so you can run this system in broad daylight. It performs about equivalently to a system that's on the order of 100,000 dollars. It costs 50 dollars. We can probably make it for 50 cents if we put our mind to it. Why doesn't somebody do it? The answer is: How do you make a profit in a capitalist system, doing that? Interesting problem.So, let me finish by saying that we've thought about this as a kind of engineering problem. And we've asked: What is the scientific unifying idea here? And we've decided we should think about this not so much in terms of cost, but in terms of simplicity. Simplicity is a neat word. You've got to think about what simplicity means. I know what it is, but I don't actually know what it means.So I actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people. The most recent involved a couple of people at MIT, one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who is one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius. We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity. And I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought.[What is simplicity? \"It's impossible to f..k it up\"](Laughter)So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.Thank you very much.(Applause)", "id": 760, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.658 --> 00:00:17.634\nThe problem I want to talk with you\nabout is really the problem

00:00:29.492\nAnd the basic paradigm\nwe want to suggest to you,\n\n00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:30.741\nI want to suggest to you,\n\n00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:34.437\nis one in which you say\nthat in order to treat disease,\n\n00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.833\nyou have to first know\nwhat you're treating, that's diagnostics,\n\n00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:39.504\nand then you have to do something.\n\n00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:43.844\nThe program we're involved in is something\nwe call \"Diagnostics for All,\"\n\n00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:45.979\nor \"zero-cost diagnostics.\"\n\n00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.417\nHow do you provide medically\nrelevant information\n\n00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.065\nat as close as possible to zero cost?\n\n00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.319\nHow do you do it?\n\n00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:55.134\nLet me just give you two examples.\n\n00:00:55.665 --> 00:01:01.531\nThe rigors of military medicine are not\nso dissimilar from the third world:\n\n00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:05.907\npoor resources, a rigorous environment --\na series of problems --\n\n00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.912\nlight weight and things of this kind.\n\n00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:11.370\nAnd also they're not so different\nfrom the home health care\n\n00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:13.799\nand diagnostic system world.\n\n00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:18.671\nSo, the technology I want to talk\nabout is for the third world,\n\n00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:20.093\nfor the developing world,\n\n00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:22.658\nbut it has, I think,\nmuch broader application,\n\n00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:26.145\nbecause information is so important\nin the health care system.\n\n00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:28.793\nSo you see two examples here.\n\n00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:34.566\nOne is a lab that is actually\na fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.\n\n00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.894\nThe second is basically an entrepreneur\nwho is set up and doing who-knows-what\n\n00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:40.365\nat a table in a market.\n\n00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:43.336\nI don't know what kind\nof health care is delivered there.\n\n00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.212\nBut it's not really\nwhat is probably most efficient.\n\n00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.932\nWhat is our approach?\n\n00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.925\nThe way in which one typically\napproaches a problem of lowering cost,\n\n00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:59.812\nstarting from the perspective\nof the United States,\n\n00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.979\nis to take our solution,\n\n00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.158\nand then try to cut cost out of it.\n\n00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.134\nNo matter how you do that,\n\n00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.664\nyou're not going to start\nwith a $100,000 instrument\n\n00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:10.109\nand bring it down to no cost.\n\n00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.306\nIt isn't going to work.\n\n00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.189\nSo the approach we took\nwas the other way around, to ask:\n\n00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:16.678\nWhat is the cheapest possible stuff\n\n00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:19.638\nthat you could make\na diagnostic system out of,\n\n00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:22.209\nand get useful information\nand add function?\n\n00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.230\nAnd what we've chosen is paper.\n\n00:02:24.254 --> 00:02:27.278\nWhat you see here is a prototypic device.\n\n00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:29.134\nIt's about a centimeter on the side.\n\n00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:31.135\nIt's about the size of a fingernail.\n\n00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.762\nThe lines around the edges are a polymer.\n\n00:02:34.786 --> 00:02:36.628\nIt's made of paper.\n\n00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:41.337\nAnd paper, of course, wicks fluid,\nas you know, paper, cloth --\n\n00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.237\ndrop wine on the tablecloth,\n\n00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.998\nand the wine wicks all over everything.\n\n00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:48.061\nPut it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.\n\n00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.824\nThat's what a hydrophilic surface does.\n\n00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.471\nSo in this device, the idea\nis that you drip the bottom end of it\n\n00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:57.134\nin a drop of, in this case, urine.\n\n00:02:57.158 --> 00:03:00.906\nThe fluid wicks its way\ninto those chambers at the top.\n\n00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.134\nThe brown color indicates\nthe amount of glucose in the urine,\n\n00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:08.705\nthe blue color indicates the amount\nof protein in the urine.\n\n00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.765\nAnd the combination of those two\nis a first-order shot\n\n00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.911\nat a number of useful things\nthat you want.\n\n00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:18.292\nSo, this is an example of a device\nmade from a simple piece of paper.\n\n00:03:18.316 --> 00:03:20.576\nNow, how simple can you make\nthe production?\n\n00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:22.923\nWhy do we choose paper?\n\n00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:26.327\nThere's an example\nof the same thing on a finger,\n\n00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.607\nshowing you basically what it looks like.\n\n00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.059\nOne reason for using paper\nis that it's everywhere.\n\n00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:36.256\nWe have made these kinds of devices\nusing napkins and toilet paper\n\n00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.510\nand wraps, and all kinds of stuff.\n\n00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:40.972\nSo the production capability is there.\n\n00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:45.293\nThe second is, you can put lots and lots\nof tests in a very small place.\n\n00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:48.136\nI'll show you in a moment\nthat the stack of paper there\n\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.892\nwould probably hold\nsomething like 100,000 tests,\n\n00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:52.657\nsomething of that kind.\n\n00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.526\nAnd then finally, a point\nyou don't think of so much\n\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.134\nin developed world medicine:\n\n00:03:58.158 --> 00:03:59.837\nit eliminates sharps.\n\n00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:03.243\nAnd what sharps means\nis needles, things that stick.\n\n00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:05.561\nIf you've taken a sample\nof someone's blood\n\n00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:08.082\nand the someone might have hepatitis C,\n\n00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:10.653\nyou don't want to make a mistake\nand stick it in you.\n\n00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:11.974\nYou don't want to do that.\n\n00:04:11.998 --> 00:04:13.487\nSo how do you dispose of that?\n\n00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.193\nIt's a problem everywhere,\nand here, you simply burn it.\n\n00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:19.717\nSo it's a sort of a practical approach\nto starting on things.\n\n00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:25.031\nNow, you say, \"If paper is a good idea,\n\n00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:27.018\nother people have surely thought of it.\"\n\n00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:28.924\nAnd the answer is, of course, yes.\n\n00:04:28.948 --> 00:04:32.768\nThose half of you, roughly, who are women,\n\n00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:35.254\nat some point may have had\na pregnancy test.\n\n00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:39.262\nAnd the most common of these\nis in a device\n\n00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:41.134\nthat looks like the thing on the left.\n\n00:04:41.158 --> 00:04:43.650\nIt's something called\na lateral-flow immunoassay.\n\n00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:45.134\nIn that particular test,\n\n00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:48.773\nurine, either containing\na hormone called hCG,\n\n00:04:48.797 --> 00:04:52.134\ndoes or does not flow\nacross a piece of paper.\n\n00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:56.059\nAnd there are two bars; one bar\nindicates that the test is working,\n\n00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:59.248\nand if the second bar shows up,\nyou're pregnant.\n\n00:04:59.272 --> 00:05:02.443\nThis is a terrific kind of test\nin a binary world,\n\n00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:05.382\nand the nice thing about pregnancy\nis either you are pregnant\n\n00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:06.560\nor you're not pregnant;\n\n00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:09.565\nyou're not partially pregnant\nor thinking about being pregnant\n\n00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:10.873\nor something of that sort.\n\n00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:13.632\nSo it works very well there,\nbut it doesn't work very well\n\n00:05:13.656 --> 00:05:15.742\nwhen you need more\nquantitative information.\n\n00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:16.986\nThere are also dipsticks,\n\n00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.756\nbut if you look at the dipsticks,\n\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.993\nthey're for another kind\nof urine analysis.\n\n00:05:21.017 --> 00:05:23.894\nThere are an awful lot of colors\nand things like that.\n\n00:05:23.918 --> 00:05:27.211\nWhat do you actually do about that\nin a difficult circumstance?\n\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.639\nSo the approach we started with is to ask:\n\n00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:36.134\nIs it really practical\nto make things of this sort?\n\n00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:40.445\nAnd that problem is now,\nin a purely engineering way, solved.\n\n00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.018\nAnd the procedure that we have\nis simply to start with paper.\n\n00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:47.588\nYou run it through a new kind\nof printer called a wax printer.\n\n00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:50.244\nThe wax printer does\nwhat looks like printing.\n\n00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:51.426\nIt is printing.\n\n00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.490\nYou put that on, you warm it a little bit,\n\n00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:56.557\nthe wax prints through,\nso it absorbs into the paper,\n\n00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:58.725\nand you end up with the device you want.\n\n00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.828\nThe printers cost 800 bucks now.\n\n00:06:01.852 --> 00:06:05.740\nWe estimate that if you were\nto run them 24 hours a day,\n\n00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:07.872\nthey'd make about 10 million tests a year.\n\n00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:11.120\nSo it's a solved problem.\nThat particular problem is solved.\n\n00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:13.920\nAnd there is an example\nof the kind of thing that you see.\n\n00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:15.783\nThat's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.\n\n00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:18.076\nThat takes about two seconds to make.\n\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.742\nAnd so I regard that as done.\n\n00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:22.560\nThere's a very important issue here,\n\n00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:27.002\nwhich is that because it's a printer,\na color printer, it prints colors.\n\n00:06:27.026 --> 00:06:28.550\nThat's what color printers do.\n\n00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:31.340\nI'll show you in a moment,\nthat's actually quite useful.\n\n00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:35.134\nNow, the next question\nthat you would like to ask is:\n\n00:06:35.158 --> 00:06:38.349\nWhat would you like to measure?\nWhat would you like to analyze?\n\n00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:43.134\nAnd the thing you'd most like to analyze,\nwe're a fair distance from.\n\n00:06:43.158 --> 00:06:47.134\nIt's what's called\n\"fever of undiagnosed origin.\"\n\n00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:50.719\nSomeone comes into the clinic,\nthey have a fever, they feel bad.\n\n00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:51.909\nWhat do they have?\n\n00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:55.335\nDo they have TB? Do they have AIDS?\nDo they have a common cold?\n\n00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:56.573\nThe triage problem.\n\n00:06:56.597 --> 00:06:59.253\nThat's a hard problem for reasons\nI won't go through.\n\n00:06:59.277 --> 00:07:02.819\nThere are an awful lot of things\nthat you'd like to distinguish among.\n\n00:07:02.843 --> 00:07:05.045\nBut then there are a series of things --\n\n00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.653\nAIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --\n\n00:07:08.677 --> 00:07:12.172\nand simpler ones,\nsuch as guidance of treatment.\n\n00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:15.134\nNow, even that's more\ncomplicated than you think.\n\n00:07:15.158 --> 00:07:19.373\nA friend of mine works\nin transcultural psychiatry,\n\n00:07:19.397 --> 00:07:21.503\nand he is interested in the question\n\n00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:24.257\nof why people do\nand don't take their meds.\n\n00:07:24.281 --> 00:07:27.856\nSo Dapsone, or something like that,\nyou have to take for a while.\n\n00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.496\nHe has a wonderful story\nof talking to a villager in India\n\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.671\nand saying,\n\n00:07:32.695 --> 00:07:34.501\n\"Have you taken your Dapsone?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:36.391\n\"Have you taken it every day?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:38.369\n\"Have you taken if for a month?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n00:07:38.393 --> 00:07:39.894\nWhat the guy actually meant\n\n00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:43.820\nwas that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone\nto his dog that morning.\n\n00:07:43.844 --> 00:07:44.969\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:44.993 --> 00:07:48.749\nAnd he was telling the truth,\nbecause in a different culture,\n\n00:07:48.773 --> 00:07:51.347\nthe dog is a surrogate for you;\n\n00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:54.514\n\"today,\" \"this month,\"\n\"since the rainy season\" --\n\n00:07:54.538 --> 00:07:57.022\nthere are lots of opportunities\nfor misunderstanding.\n\n00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:58.053\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:01.641\nAnd so an issue here is to,\nin some cases, figure out\n\n00:08:01.665 --> 00:08:05.776\nhow to deal with matters\nthat seem uninteresting, like compliance.\n\n00:08:07.118 --> 00:08:10.663\nNow, take a look\nat what a typical test looks like.\n\n00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:15.134\nPrick a finger, you get some blood --\nabout 50 microliters.\n\n00:08:15.158 --> 00:08:16.989\nThat's about all you're going to get,\n\n00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:20.989\nbecause you can't use\nthe usual sort of systems.\n\n00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.217\nYou can't manipulate it very well;\n\n00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.357\nI'll show something\nabout that in a moment.\n\n00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:28.134\nSo you take the drop of blood,\nno further manipulations,\n\n00:08:28.158 --> 00:08:29.941\nyou put it on a little device,\n\n00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:34.638\nthe device filters out the blood cells,\nlets the serum go through,\n\n00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:38.423\nand you get a series of colors\ndown in the bottom there.\n\n00:08:38.447 --> 00:08:42.606\nAnd the colors indicate\n\"disease\" or \"normal.\"\n\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.312\nBut even that's complicated,\n\n00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:47.937\nbecause to me, colors\nmight indicate \"normal,\"\n\n00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:52.921\nbut after all, we're all suffering\nfrom probably an excess of education.\n\n00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:57.532\nWhat do you do about something\nwhich requires quantitative analysis?\n\n00:08:57.556 --> 00:09:00.238\nAnd so the solution\nthat we and many other people\n\n00:09:00.262 --> 00:09:01.873\nare thinking about there,\n\n00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:04.486\nand at this point,\nthere is a dramatic flourish,\n\n00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.682\nand out comes the universal solution\nto everything these days,\n\n00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:08.863\nwhich is a cell phone --\n\n00:09:08.887 --> 00:09:10.885\nin this particular case, a camera phone.\n\n00:09:10.909 --> 00:09:15.134\nThey're everywhere --\nsix billion a month in India.\n\n00:09:15.158 --> 00:09:20.680\nAnd the idea is that what one does\nis to take the device,\n\n00:09:20.704 --> 00:09:23.134\nyou dip it, you develop the color,\n\n00:09:23.158 --> 00:09:26.383\nyou take a picture,\nthe picture goes to a central laboratory.\n\n00:09:26.407 --> 00:09:28.134\nYou don't have to send out a doctor,\n\n00:09:28.158 --> 00:09:30.899\nyou send out somebody\nwho can just take the sample,\n\n00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:34.648\nand in the clinic either a doctor,\nor ideally, a computer in this case,\n\n00:09:34.672 --> 00:09:35.836\ndoes the analysis.\n\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.711\nTurns out to work actually quite well,\n\n00:09:37.735 --> 00:09:40.827\nparticularly when your color printer\nhas printed the color bars\n\n00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.672\nthat indicate how things work.\n\n00:09:42.696 --> 00:09:45.720\nSo my view of the health care\nworker of the future\n\n00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:48.311\nis not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,\n\n00:09:48.335 --> 00:09:51.087\notherwise unemployed, who has two things:\n\n00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:53.194\na backpack full\nof these tests and a lancet\n\n00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:55.134\nto occasionally take a blood sample,\n\n00:09:55.158 --> 00:09:56.717\nand an AK-47.\n\n00:09:56.741 --> 00:09:59.337\nAnd these are the things\nthat get him through his day.\n\n00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:00.909\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.405\nThere's another very\ninteresting connection here,\n\n00:10:04.429 --> 00:10:09.969\nand that is, that what one wants to do\nis pass through useful information\n\n00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:13.524\nover what is generally\na pretty awful telephone system.\n\n00:10:13.548 --> 00:10:16.134\nIt turns out there's an enormous\namount of information\n\n00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:19.537\nalready available on that subject,\nwhich is the Mars Rover problem.\n\n00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:23.428\nHow do you get back an accurate view\nof the color on Mars\n\n00:10:23.452 --> 00:10:27.238\nif you have a really terrible\nbandwidth to do it with?\n\n00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:29.134\nAnd the answer is not complicated,\n\n00:10:29.158 --> 00:10:31.699\nbut it's one which I don't want\nto go through here,\n\n00:10:31.723 --> 00:10:34.767\nother than to say that the communication\nsystems for doing this\n\n00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:36.492\nare really pretty well understood.\n\n00:10:36.516 --> 00:10:39.253\nAlso, a fact which you may not know\n\n00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:43.011\nis that the compute capability\nof this thing is not so different\n\n00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:45.874\nfrom the compute capability\nof your desktop computer.\n\n00:10:45.898 --> 00:10:49.559\nThis is a fantastic device\nwhich is only beginning to be tapped.\n\n00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:53.029\nI don't know whether the idea\nof one computer, one child\n\n00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:54.204\nmakes any sense.\n\n00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:56.134\nHere's the computer of the future,\n\n00:10:56.158 --> 00:10:59.359\nbecause this screen is already there\nand they're ubiquitous.\n\n00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:04.046\nAll right, let me show you just\na little bit about advanced devices.\n\n00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.224\nAnd we'll start by posing\na little problem.\n\n00:11:06.248 --> 00:11:09.645\nWhat you see here\nis another centimeter-sized device,\n\n00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:13.652\nand the different colors\nare different colors of dye.\n\n00:11:13.676 --> 00:11:14.854\nAnd you notice something\n\n00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:17.577\nwhich might strike you\nas a little bit interesting,\n\n00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.458\nwhich is, the yellow seems to disappear,\n\n00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:22.971\nget through the blue,\nand then get through the red.\n\n00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:24.148\nHow does that happen?\n\n00:11:24.172 --> 00:11:26.747\nHow do you make something\nflow through something?\n\n00:11:26.771 --> 00:11:28.966\nAnd, of course the answer is, \"You don't.\"\n\n00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.733\nYou make it flow under and over.\n\n00:11:30.757 --> 00:11:31.918\nBut now the question is:\n\n00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:35.484\nHow do you make it flow\nunder and over in a piece of paper?\n\n00:11:35.508 --> 00:11:38.454\nThe answer is that what you do --\n\n00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:41.134\nand the details are not\nterribly important here --\n\n00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:43.049\nis to make something more elaborate:\n\n00:11:43.073 --> 00:11:45.150\nYou take several different\nlayers of paper,\n\n00:11:45.174 --> 00:11:48.245\neach one containing\nits own little fluid system,\n\n00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:52.858\nand you separate them by pieces of,\nliterally, double-sided carpet tape,\n\n00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:55.768\nthe stuff you use to stick\nthe carpets onto the floor.\n\n00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:59.018\nAnd the fluid will flow\nfrom one layer into the next.\n\n00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:02.134\nIt distributes itself,\nflows through further holes,\n\n00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:03.747\ndistributes itself.\n\n00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:07.012\nAnd what you see,\nat the lower right-hand side there,\n\n00:12:07.036 --> 00:12:12.335\nis a sample in which a single sample\nof blood has been put on the top,\n\n00:12:12.359 --> 00:12:14.869\nand it has gone through\nand distributed itself\n\n00:12:14.893 --> 00:12:18.239\ninto these 16 holes on the bottom,\n\n00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:20.967\nin a piece of paper --\nbasically, it looks like a chip,\n\n00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:22.729\ntwo pieces of paper thick.\n\n00:12:22.753 --> 00:12:24.236\nAnd in this particular case,\n\n00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.024\nwe were just interested\nin the replicability of that.\n\n00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:29.352\nBut that is, in principle,\nthe way you solve\n\n00:12:29.376 --> 00:12:31.532\nthe \"fever of unexplained origin\" problem,\n\n00:12:31.556 --> 00:12:34.312\nbecause each one of those spots\nthen becomes a test\n\n00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:37.935\nfor a particular set\nof markers of disease,\n\n00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:40.225\nand this will work in due course.\n\n00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:43.565\nHere is an example of a slightly\nmore complicated device.\n\n00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:44.771\nThere's the chip.\n\n00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:46.011\nYou dip in a corner.\n\n00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:47.582\nThe fluid goes into the center.\n\n00:12:47.606 --> 00:12:51.389\nIt distributes itself out\ninto these various wells or holes\n\n00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:52.649\nand turns color,\n\n00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:55.366\nall done with paper and carpet tape.\n\n00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.547\nSo it's, I think, as low-cost\n\n00:12:57.571 --> 00:13:00.398\nas we're likely to be able\nto come up and make things.\n\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.686\nNow, I have two last\nlittle stories to tell you\n\n00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.320\nin finishing off this business.\n\n00:13:07.344 --> 00:13:08.509\nThis is one:\n\n00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:10.974\nOne of the things\nyou occasionally need to do\n\n00:13:10.998 --> 00:13:13.645\nis separate blood cells from serum.\n\n00:13:14.832 --> 00:13:16.517\nAnd the question was,\n\n00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:18.642\nhere we do it by taking a sample,\n\n00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:22.528\nwe put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,\n\n00:13:22.552 --> 00:13:25.019\nand you get blood cells out.\n\n00:13:25.043 --> 00:13:26.202\nTerrific.\n\n00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:29.673\nWhat happens if you don't have\nelectricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?\n\n00:13:29.697 --> 00:13:32.213\nAnd we thought for a while\nof how you might do this,\n\n00:13:32.237 --> 00:13:34.874\nand the way, in fact, you do it,\nis what's shown here.\n\n00:13:34.898 --> 00:13:39.505\nYou get an eggbeater, which is everywhere,\nand you saw off a blade,\n\n00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:42.012\nand then you take tubing,\nand you stick it on that.\n\n00:13:42.036 --> 00:13:44.776\nYou put the blood in,\nsomebody sits there and spins it.\n\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.919\nIt works really, really well.\n\n00:13:46.943 --> 00:13:49.357\nAnd we sat down,\nwe did the physics of eggbeaters\n\n00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:52.458\nand self-aligning tubes\nand all the rest of that kind of thing,\n\n00:13:52.482 --> 00:13:53.944\nand sent it off to a journal.\n\n00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:55.290\nWe were very proud of this,\n\n00:13:55.314 --> 00:13:58.176\nparticularly the title,\nwhich was \"Eggbeater as Centrifuge.\"\n\n00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.274\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:00.449\nAnd we sent it off,\n\n00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:02.380\nand by return mail, it came back.\n\n00:14:02.404 --> 00:14:04.134\nI called up the editor and I said,\n\n00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:06.280\n\"What's going on? How is this possible?\"\n\n00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:09.438\nThe editor said, with enormous disdain,\n\n00:14:09.462 --> 00:14:10.905\n\"I read this.\n\n00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:14.685\nAnd we're not going to publish it,\nbecause we only publish science.\"\n\n00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:16.122\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.615\nAnd it's an important issue,\n\n00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:21.037\nbecause it means\nthat we have to, as a society,\n\n00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.038\nthink about what we value.\n\n00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:25.846\nAnd if it's just papers\nand Phys. Rev. letters,\n\n00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.113\nwe've got a problem.\n\n00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:31.006\nHere is another example\nof something which is --\n\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.071\nthis is a little spectrophotometer.\n\n00:14:33.095 --> 00:14:36.385\nIt measures the absorption\nof light in a sample.\n\n00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:37.888\nThe neat thing about this is,\n\n00:14:37.912 --> 00:14:41.603\nyou have a light source that flickers\non and off at about 1,000 hertz,\n\n00:14:41.627 --> 00:14:45.296\nanother light source\nthat detects that light at 1,000 hertz,\n\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.134\nand so you can run this system\nin broad daylight.\n\n00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:50.227\nIt performs about equivalently\n\n00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:54.820\nto a system that's on the order\nof 100,000 dollars.\n\n00:14:54.844 --> 00:14:56.005\nIt costs 50 dollars.\n\n00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:00.134\nWe can probably make it for 50 cents\nif we put our mind to it.\n\n00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:02.031\nWhy doesn't somebody do it?\n\n00:15:02.055 --> 00:15:03.206\nThe answer is:\n\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.500\nHow do you make a profit\nin a capitalist system, doing that?\n\n00:15:06.524 --> 00:15:07.816\nInteresting problem.\n\n00:15:09.273 --> 00:15:14.226\nSo, let me finish by saying\nthat we've thought about this\n\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.452\nas a kind of engineering problem.\n\n00:15:16.476 --> 00:15:20.858\nAnd we've asked: What\nis the scientific unifying idea here?\n\n00:15:20.882 --> 00:15:23.006\nAnd we've decided\nwe should think about this\n\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.134\nnot so much in terms of cost,\nbut in terms of simplicity.\n\n00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:27.736\nSimplicity is a neat word.\n\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.134\nYou've got to think\nabout what simplicity means.\n\n00:15:30.713 --> 00:15:31.869\nI know what it is,\n\n00:15:31.893 --> 00:15:34.070\nbut I don't actually know what it means.\n\n00:15:34.094 --> 00:15:36.191\nSo I actually was interested\nenough in this\n\n00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:39.968\nto put together several groups of people.\n\n00:15:40.602 --> 00:15:43.134\nThe most recent involved\na couple of people at MIT,\n\n00:15:43.158 --> 00:15:45.278\none of them being\nan exceptionally bright kid\n\n00:15:45.302 --> 00:15:48.012\nwho is one of the very\nfew people I would think of\n\n00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:49.425\nwho's an authentic genius.\n\n00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:53.499\nWe all struggled for an entire day\nto think about simplicity.\n\n00:15:53.523 --> 00:15:57.705\nAnd I want to give you the answer\nof this deep scientific thought.\n\n00:15:57.729 --> 00:15:59.062\n[What is simplicity?\n\n00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:00.673\n\"It's impossible to f..k it up\"]\n\n00:16:00.697 --> 00:16:01.746\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.220\nSo, in a sense, you get what you pay for.\n\n00:16:04.244 --> 00:16:05.753\nThank you very much.\n\n00:16:05.777 --> 00:16:07.862\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A new strategy in the war on cancer", "duration": "1424", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_agus_a_new_strategy_in_the_war_on_cancer", "transcript": "I'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago, and this was the cover of Fortune magazine sitting in the window of the pharmacy.And so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this, and you get a little bit downhearted. But when you start to read the article by Cliff, who himself is a cancer survivor, who was saved by a clinical trial where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York to get an experimental therapy for \u2014 at the time \u2014 Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life, he makes remarkable points here. And the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology, in our view of cancer. For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating the individual gene in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.So, this is an astounding table. And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday in that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts on cardiovascular disease, but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer in over 50 years hasn't changed. We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia, where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission, but in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.So, what I'm going to tell you today, is a little bit of why I think that's the case, and then go out of my comfort zone and tell you where I think it's going, where a new approach \u2014 that we hope to push forward in terms of treating cancer. Because this is wrong.So, what is cancer, first of all? Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor, they stick a needle in. They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition: Does it look normal? Does it look abnormal?So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle. This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell. That is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer. There's no molecular test, there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday, there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes. This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer. So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early. It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early. We can prevent most cancers. You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease. We could do the same in cancer. I co-founded a company called Navigenics, where, if you spit into a tube \u2014 and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease, all of which are delayable in many of the cancers \u2014 you start to identify what you could get, and then we can start to work to prevent them. Because the problem is, when you have advanced cancer, we can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.So, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged. Why is it a disease of the aged? Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children. See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45, it said \"It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny.\" So if you look at cancers, it is very rare \u2014 extremely rare \u2014 to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year. As one gets older? Very, very common.Why is it hard to treat? Because it's heterogeneous, and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer. It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells, what we call clonal selection. But, if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more, then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.So, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms: \"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc.\" You then have some anatomic descriptions, you get that CT scan: \"There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.\" You then have some body part descriptions: \"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate.\" And that's about it. So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor. It's basically symptoms. It's manifestations of a disease.What's exciting is that over the last two or three years, the government has spent 400 million dollars, and they've allocated another billion dollars, to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project. So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer, and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it. You know, in the mid-1850's in France, they started to describe cancer by body part. That hasn't changed in over 150 years. It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate, by breast, by muscle. It makes no sense, if you think about it.So, obviously, the technology is here today, and, over the next several years, that will change. You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic. You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic, and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions that were involved in causing this individual cancer. So, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine, and be able to do what they do in infectious disease, which is look at that organism, that bacteria, and then say, \"This antibiotic makes sense, because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.\" When one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu, and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease. Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it \u2014 although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now. The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer. In the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer, and then lung cancer will come several months after. There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes, which I think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease. But remember, I'm not pushing genomics, proteomics, to be a reductionist. I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against. And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.In health care today, we spend most of the dollars \u2014 in terms of treating disease \u2014 most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life. We spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against. If you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against, you're going to do things a hell of a lot better. If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease, we can take it enormously the other direction, and obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.So, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute. And I'm here to tell you, it's wrong. So, the website of the National Cancer Institute says that cancer is a genetic disease. The website says, \"If you look, there's an individual mutation, and maybe a second, and maybe a third, and that is cancer.\" But, as a cancer doc, this is what I see. This isn't a genetic disease. So, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it, and you see into the microscope a lymph node where cancer has invaded. You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver. Cancer is an interaction of a cell that no longer is under growth control with the environment. It's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment. It's what we call a system.The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer. And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades, is that we have strived to understand cancer. The goal is to control cancer. And that is a very different optimization scheme, a very different strategy for all of us.I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research, one of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there, and I said, \"We've made a mistake. We've all made a mistake, myself included, by focusing down, by being a reductionist. We need to take a step back.\" And, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience. People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.You know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago. We were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other. I said, \"Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?\" And he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor? But people prevailed on us, and we got together, and it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative. We have designed, and we have worked on the modeling \u2014 and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team \u2014 the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system. And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.The key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data, you have to understand the data inputs. You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days, and I asked, \"What was the average temperature?\" and it came back at 98.7, I would say, \"Great.\" But if during one of those days your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours, and you took Tylenol and got better, etc., I would totally miss it. So, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine is that you and I, and all of us, we go to our doctor once a year. We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.Earlier it was referred to this direct life device. You know, I've been using it for two and a half months. It's a staggering device, not because it tells me how many kilocalories I do every day, but because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day. And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk, and I'm not moving at all. And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here are really different than we understand them, because we're not measuring them dynamically.And so, if you think of cancer as a system, there's an input and an output and a state in the middle. So, the states, are equivalent classes of history, and the cancer patient, the input, is the environment, the diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations. The output are our symptoms: Do we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.? Most of that state is hidden. So what we do in our field is we change and input, we give aggressive chemotherapy, and we say, \"Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?\"And so, the problem is that it's not just one system, it's multiple systems on multiple scales. It's a system of systems. And so, when you start to look at emergent systems, you can look at a neuron under a microscope. A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here, but when you start to put them together in a complex system, and you start to see that it becomes a brain, and that brain can create intelligence, what we're talking about in the body, and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system. Well, the bad news is that these robust \u2014 and robust is a key word \u2014 emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail. The good news is you can manipulate them. You can try to control them without that fundamental understanding of every component.One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine, where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer. So, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get. They had gotten their chemotherapy, and then they randomized them, where half got placebo, and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone. It's used to treat osteoporosis, and they got that twice a year. They looked and, in these 1,800 women, given twice a year a drug that builds bone, you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent. Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn't even touch the cancer. So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well. You change that system, and you could have a marked effect on the cancer.Nobody has ever shown \u2014 and this will be shocking \u2014 nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy actually touches a cancer cell. It's never been shown. There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes, that if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell, but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near the doses that happen in the body.If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol every three weeks, which is the standard, about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer have a great response to that drug. And a response is 50 percent shrinkage. Well, remember that's not even an order of magnitude, but that's a different story. They then recur, I give them that same drug every week. Another 30 percent will respond. They then recur, I give them that same drug over 96 hours by continuous infusion, another 20 or 30 percent will respond. So, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size. It's not. We have no idea the mechanism. So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system, just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence, chemotherapy may work by that same exact way. The wild thing about that trial also, was that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.So, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing. They're dynamic. I mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside, but it looks at obesity in the world. And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small. But, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there, more than 75 percent of the population of those countries are obese. Look a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different. So, our systems today are dramatically different than our systems a decade or two ago. So the diseases we have today, which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades, are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this.So, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture of the whole proteome. So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet, and we're able to get resolution where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body. We can start to see that system. Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified. The power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here, is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology. So, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis and a group called Applied Proteomics, where we can start to see individual neutron differences, and we can start to look at that system like we never have before. So, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.So this is a woman, 46 years old, who had recurrent lung cancer. It was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver. She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere, Gemcitabine, Navelbine: Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow. She had three kids under the age of 12, and this is her CT scan. And so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here, and you can see in the middle there is her heart, and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks. She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway, and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer, but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone. Six months later it's still gone. That cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer, but she got three years from a drug whose symptoms predominately were acne. That's about it.So, the problem is that the clinical trial was done, and we were a part of it, and in the fundamental clinical trial \u2014 the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three, we refused to use a placebo. Would you want your mother, your brother, your sister to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live? And the answer, obviously, is not. So, it was done on this group of patients. Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here, and the drug went to the FDA, and the FDA said, \"Without a placebo, how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?\" So the morning the FDA was going to meet, this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal. (Laughter) And so, what do you know, that drug was approved.The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial, where they gave half placebo and half the drug. And we learned something important there. What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada, where it's \"more ethical to give placebos.\" They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval, so I think there were three U.S. patients in upstate New York who were part of the trial. But they did that, and what they found is that 70 percent of the non-responders lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo. So it challenged everything we knew in cancer, is that you don't need to get a response. You don't need to shrink the disease. If we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit on patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel, than if we shrink the disease.The problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver, and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters, did that drug help you or not? How do I know? Would it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug with no benefit and significant cost? So, it's a fundamental problem. And, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.And so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office \u2014 well, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right? The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening. That is the most effective, cost-effective, best way we can do things today. But if one is unfortunate to get a disease, you'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood, and we will start to know how to treat your disease. The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics, again, this looking at the system. It's taking a big picture.The problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body, there are 11 orders of magnitude difference between the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins. So, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude. And so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software. We can start to look at different components along this spectrum.And so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration. And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now is that people from those fields are coming in. Yesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program called the Physical Sciences and Oncology, where physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer, people who never approached it before. Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday, to try to attach this problem. A whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different mechanisms, to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.So, just for two seconds, how these technologies work \u2014 because I think it's important to understand it. What happens is every protein in your body is charged, so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around, and then there's a detector at the end. When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge. And so we can accurately \u2014 if the magnet is big enough, and your resolution is high enough \u2014 you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body and start to get an understanding of the individual system.And so, as a cancer doctor, instead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick, this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices, where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data. Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease. And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter, without fundamental learning.So, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking. We need to start to think differently and radically. And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas. Tell them to me or anyone else in our field, because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed. We need a radically different approach.You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel \u2014 and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual. When Andy stepped down, he said, \"No technology will win. Technology itself will win.\" And I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer, that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies that will help us move forward and hopefully help patients in the near-term.Thank you very much.", "id": 761, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nand walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nand this was the cover of Fortune magazine\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nsitting in the window of the pharmacy.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nAnd so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nand you get a little bit downhearted.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nBut when you start to read the article by Cliff,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nwho himself is a cancer survivor,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nwho was saved by a clinical trial\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwhere his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nto get an experimental therapy for --\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nat the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nhe makes remarkable points here.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd the point of the article was that we have gotten\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nreductionist in our view of biology,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nin our view of cancer.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nFor the last 50 years, we have focused on treating\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthe individual gene\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nin understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nSo, this is an astounding table.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nAnd this is something that sobers us in our field everyday\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nin that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\non cardiovascular disease,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nbut look at cancer. The death rate in cancer\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nin over 50 years hasn't changed.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nWe've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nwhere we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbut in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nSo, what I'm going to tell you today,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nis a little bit of why I think that's the case,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand then go out of my comfort zone\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nand tell you where I think it's going,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nwhere a new approach -- that we hope to push forward\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nin terms of treating cancer.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nBecause this is wrong.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nSo, what is cancer, first of all?\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nWell, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nthey stick a needle in.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThey way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nDoes it look normal? Does it look abnormal?\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nSo, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nThis is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThat is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nThere's no molecular test,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthere's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nthere's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThis is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nYou know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nSo, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nIt is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nWe can prevent most cancers.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nYou know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nWe could do the same in cancer.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nI co-founded a company called Navigenics,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwhere, if you spit into a tube --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nall of which are delayable in many of the cancers --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nyou start to identify what you could get,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand then we can start to work to prevent them.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nBecause the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwe can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSo, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nWhy is it a disease of the aged?\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBecause evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nSee, evolution protected us during our childbearing years\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nit said \"It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny.\"\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo if you look at cancers, it is very rare -- extremely rare --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nto have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAs one gets older? Very, very common.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nWhy is it hard to treat?\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBecause it's heterogeneous,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nIt starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nwhat we call clonal selection.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nBut, if we start to understand\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nthat cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthen we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nSo, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nis that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\n\"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc.\"\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nYou then have some anatomic descriptions,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou get that CT scan: \"There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nYou then have some body part descriptions:\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\n\"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate.\"\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAnd that's about it.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nSo, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nIt's basically symptoms.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nIt's manifestations of a disease.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWhat's exciting is that over the last two or three years,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nthe government has spent 400 million dollars,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand they've allocated another billion dollars,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nto what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nSo, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nYou know, in the mid-1850's in France,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthey started to describe cancer by body part.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThat hasn't changed in over 150 years.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nIt is absolutely archaic that we call cancer\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nby prostate, by breast, by muscle.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nIt makes no sense, if you think about it.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nSo, obviously, the technology is here today,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand, over the next several years, that will change.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nYou will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nYou will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nthat were involved in causing this individual cancer.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nSo, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nmore to the science of medicine,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand be able to do what they do in infectious disease,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nwhich is look at that organism, that bacteria,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand then say, \"This antibiotic makes sense,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nbecause you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.\"\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nWhen one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nand prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nWhy? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it --\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nalthough we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nThe Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThe first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIn the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand then lung cancer will come several months after.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThere's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nwhich I think is going to be the next level\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nin terms of understanding and classifying disease.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut remember, I'm not pushing genomics,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nproteomics, to be a reductionist.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nI'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nIn health care today, we spend most of the dollars --\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nin terms of treating disease --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nmost of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWe spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nIf you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nyou're going to do things a hell of a lot better.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nIf we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwe can take it enormously the other direction,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSo, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nSo, the website of the National Cancer Institute\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nsays that cancer is a genetic disease.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nThe website says, \"If you look, there's an individual mutation,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand maybe a second, and maybe a third,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand that is cancer.\"\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nBut, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nThis isn't a genetic disease.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand you see into the microscope a lymph node\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhere cancer has invaded.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nYou see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nCancer is an interaction of a cell\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nthat no longer is under growth control with the environment.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nIt's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nIt's what we call a system.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nThe goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nis that we have strived to understand cancer.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThe goal is to control cancer.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nAnd that is a very different optimization scheme,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\na very different strategy for all of us.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nI got up at the American Association of Cancer Research,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\none of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand I said, \"We've made a mistake.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWe've all made a mistake, myself included,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nby focusing down, by being a reductionist.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nWe need to take a step back.\"\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nPeople got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nYou know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nWe were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nI said, \"Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?\"\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nBut people prevailed on us, and we got together,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nWe have designed, and we have worked on the modeling --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team --\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthe modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd I'll show you some data there\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nwhere I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThe key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nyou have to understand the data inputs.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nYou know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand I asked, \"What was the average temperature?\"\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nand it came back at 98.7, I would say, \"Great.\"\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nBut if during one of those days\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nyour temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nI would totally miss it.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nis that you and I, and all of us,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nwe go to our doctor once a year.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWe have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nEarlier it was referred to this direct life device.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nYou know, I've been using it for two and a half months.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nIt's a staggering device, not because it tells me\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nhow many kilocalories I do every day,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nbut because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nand I'm not moving at all.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nAnd a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nare really different than we understand them,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nbecause we're not measuring them dynamically.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd so, if you think of cancer as a system,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthere's an input and an output and a state in the middle.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nSo, the states, are equivalent classes of history,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthe diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nThe output are our symptoms:\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nDo we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nMost of that state is hidden.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nSo what we do in our field is we change and input,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwe give aggressive chemotherapy,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand we say, \"Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?\"\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd so, the problem is that it's not just one system,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nit's multiple systems on multiple scales.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt's a system of systems.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd so, when you start to look at emergent systems,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nyou can look at a neuron under a microscope.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nA neuron under the microscope is very elegant\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwith little things sticking out and little things over here,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nbut when you start to put them together in a complex system,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand you start to see that it becomes a brain,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand that brain can create intelligence,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nwhat we're talking about in the body,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nand cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, the bad news is that these robust --\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand robust is a key word --\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nemergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThe good news is you can manipulate them.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nYou can try to control them\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwithout that fundamental understanding of every component.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nOne of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ncame out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nwhere they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nThey had gotten their chemotherapy,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nand then they randomized them,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwhere half got placebo,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt's used to treat osteoporosis,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand they got that twice a year.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nThey looked and, in these 1,800 women,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\ngiven twice a year a drug that builds bone,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nyou reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nReduce occurrence of cancer by a drug\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nthat doesn't even touch the cancer.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSo the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nYou change that system,\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand you could have a marked effect on the cancer.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nnobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nactually touches a cancer cell.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nIt's never been shown.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nThere's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nthat if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nbut the doses in those dishes are nowhere near\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nthe doses that happen in the body.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nIf I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nevery three weeks, which is the standard,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nabout 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nhave a great response to that drug.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAnd a response is 50 percent shrinkage.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nWell, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbut that's a different story.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nThey then recur, I give them that same drug every week.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnother 30 percent will respond.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nThey then recur, I give them that same drug\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nover 96 hours by continuous infusion,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nanother 20 or 30 percent will respond.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIt's not. We have no idea the mechanism.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nSo the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthat complex system,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:43.958\njust like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nchemotherapy may work by that same exact way.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThe wild thing about that trial also,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwas that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nSo, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThey're dynamic.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nI mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nbut it looks at obesity in the world.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nBut, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nmore than 75 percent of the population\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nof those countries are obese.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nLook a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nSo, our systems today are dramatically different\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthan our systems a decade or two ago.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nSo the diseases we have today,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nwhich reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nare going to change dramatically over the next decade or so\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbased on things like this.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nSo, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nof the whole proteome.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nSo this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nand we're able to get resolution\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nwhere we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nWe can start to see that system.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nEach of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThe power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nis that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nSo, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand a group called Applied Proteomics,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nwhere we can start to see individual neutron differences,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nand we can start to look at that system like we never have before.\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nSo, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nSo this is a woman, 46 years old,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nwho had recurrent lung cancer.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nIt was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nShe had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nGemcitabine, Navelbine:\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nEvery drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nShe had three kids under the age of 12,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nand this is her CT scan.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nAnd so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nand you can see in the middle there is her heart,\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nthat will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nShe goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nand again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nbut it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nSix months later it's still gone.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nThat cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nbut she got three years from a drug\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nwhose symptoms predominately were acne.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nThat's about it.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nSo, the problem is that the clinical trial was done,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nand we were a part of it,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nand in the fundamental clinical trial --\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nthe pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nwe refused to use a placebo.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nWould you want your mother, your brother, your sister\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nto get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nAnd the answer, obviously, is not.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nSo, it was done on this group of patients.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nTen percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nand the drug went to the FDA,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nand the FDA said, \"Without a placebo,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nhow do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?\"\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nSo the morning the FDA was going to meet,\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nthis was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nAnd so, what do you know, that drug was approved.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nThe amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial,\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nwhere they gave half placebo and half the drug.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nAnd we learned something important there.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nWhat's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nwhere it's \"more ethical to give placebos.\"\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nThey had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nso I think there were three U.S. patients\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nin upstate New York who were part of the trial.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nBut they did that, and what they found\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nis that 70 percent of the non-responders\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nlived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nSo it challenged everything we knew in cancer,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nis that you don't need to get a response.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nYou don't need to shrink the disease.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nIf we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:31.958\non patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nthan if we shrink the disease.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nThe problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nand you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nand you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\ndid that drug help you or not?\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nHow do I know?\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nWould it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nwith no benefit and significant cost?\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nSo, it's a fundamental problem.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nAnd, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nAnd so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office --\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nwell, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nThe ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nThat is the most effective, cost-effective,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.958\nbest way we can do things today.\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nBut if one is unfortunate to get a disease,\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nyou'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nand we will start to know how to treat your disease.\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nThe way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nagain, this looking at the system.\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.958\nIt's taking a big picture.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nThe problem with technologies like this is\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nthat if one looks at proteins in the body,\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nthere are 11 orders of magnitude difference\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nbetween the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nSo, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nAnd so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nis to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nWe can start to look at different components along this spectrum.\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nAnd so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration.\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nAnd I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nis that people from those fields are coming in.\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nYesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\ncalled the Physical Sciences and Oncology,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:25.958\nwhere physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,\n\n00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.958\npeople who never approached it before.\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nDanny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nto try to attach this problem.\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nA whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nby different mechanisms,\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nto try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:49.958\nSo, just for two seconds, how these technologies work --\n\n00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nbecause I think it's important to understand it.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:55.958\nWhat happens is every protein in your body is charged,\n\n00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nso the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.958\nand then there's a detector at the end.\n\n00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:06.958\nWhen it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nAnd so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough,\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.958\nand your resolution is high enough --\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:14.958\nyou can actually detect all of the proteins in the body\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:18.958\nand start to get an understanding of the individual system.\n\n00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nAnd so, as a cancer doctor,\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:25.958\ninstead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:29.958\nthis is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,\n\n00:22:29.958 --> 00:22:32.958\nwhere that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:36.958\nElectronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.\n\n00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:40.958\nAnd certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nand actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.958\nwithout fundamental learning.\n\n00:22:47.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nSo, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nWe need to start to think differently and radically.\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:23:01.958\nAnd so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.\n\n00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.958\nTell them to me or anyone else in our field,\n\n00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.958\nbecause over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.\n\n00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:10.958\nWe need a radically different approach.\n\n00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:13.958\nYou know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel --\n\n00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:16.958\nand Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.\n\n00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.958\nWhen Andy stepped down, he said,\n\n00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:21.958\n\"No technology will win. Technology itself will win.\"\n\n00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:25.958\nAnd I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,\n\n00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:28.958\nthat it's going to be a broad platform of technologies\n\n00:23:28.958 --> 00:23:30.958\nthat will help us move forward\n\n00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.958\nand hopefully help patients in the near-term.\n\n00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:34.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "The painter and the pendulum", "duration": "801", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_shannon_the_painter_and_the_pendulum", "transcript": "John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom. And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work. In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work?Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for, it's usually to solve a question. I had the question popped into my head: What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres? And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth? And so I went about and made that sculpture, turning it out of solid bronze. And I did one that was about 35 feet long. The sun end was about four inches in diameter, and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end. And so for me, it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context, as though you were an astronaut, and see these two things as an object, because they are so intimately bound, and one is meaningless without the other.JH: Is there a relief in playing with these forces? And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces.TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects \u2014 like that silver one there, that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets, trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that.JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.TS: Yeah. It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.JH: I agree.TS: The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism, so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe. But with the pendulum, it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. My sculptures are normally very simplified. I try to refine them down to very simple forms. But the paintings become very complex, because I think the fields that are supporting them, they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating, and they're interference patterns.JH: And they're non-deterministic. I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin, even though the forces can be calculated. So the evolution of this \u2014 I gather this isn't your first pendulum.TS: No. (JH: No.)TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's, and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it. I threw it into an orbit, and it only had one color, and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out, so I had to run in there, didn't have any control over the spigot remotely. So that told me right away: I need a remote control device. But then I started dreaming of having six colors. I sort of think about it as the DNA \u2014 these colors, the red, blue, yellow, the primary colors and white and black. And if you put them together in different combinations \u2014 just like printing in a sense, like how a magazine color is printed \u2014 and put them under certain forces, which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them, these amazing things started appearing.JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases. I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. I want to just say \u2014 so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.JH: Thanks guys.TS: So here are the \u2014JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.(Laughter)JH: Whoa. That is ... ooh, nice.TS: So something like this. I'm doing this as a demo, and it's more playful, but inevitably, all of this can be used. I can redeem this painting, just continuing on, doing layers upon layers. And I keep it around for a couple of weeks, and I'm contemplating it, and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level, where all of this becomes the background, the depth of it.JH: That's fantastic. So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio-controlled airplane valves.TS: Yes, they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. And they can pinch them very tight and stop it, or you can have them wide open. And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint, or I could put anything into this. It could be tomato sauce, or anything could be dispensed \u2014 sand, powders or anything like that.JH: So many forces there. You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force, you've got the fluid dynamics. Each of these beautiful paintings, are they images in and of themselves, or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas?TS: Well, this painting here, I wanted to do something very simple, a simple, iconic image of two ripples interfering. So the one on the right was done first, and then the one on the left was done over it. And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. And then when I did the second one, it really disturbed the piece \u2014 these big blue lines crashing through the center of it \u2014 and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap. There are lines in front of the one on the right, and there are lines behind the one on the left, and so it takes it into different planes. What it's also about, just the little events, the events of the interpenetration of \u2014JH: Two stars, or \u2014TS: Two things that happened \u2014 there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens. There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening, and I'm very interested in that. Like the occurrence of moire patterns. Like this green one, this is a painting I did about 10 years ago, but it has some \u2014 see, in the upper third \u2014 there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns, which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives.JH: Is that a literal part of the image, or is my eye making that interference pattern \u2014 is my eye completing that interference pattern?TS: It is the paint actually, makes it real. It's really manifested there. If I throw a very concentric circle, or concentric ellipse, it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines, which get closer and closer together, which describes how gravity works. There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus, especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it, the scale, is very interesting to me.My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology. Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close, odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles, elephants. There are lots of things that appear. When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns, but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered. And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are, but they're equally well-resolved and complex. So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive. Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology, it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with. And maybe it's the kind of forms we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars, where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface.JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's. Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there. You know, it seems at this stage in your life, you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant \u2014 I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. Is that relevant to your work?TS: As it turns out, this device kind of comes in handy, because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do, that I can operate slides, which is more of a mental process. I'm looking at it and making decisions: It needs more red, it needs more blue, it needs a different shape. And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much, much simpler way. I mean, I've got the symptoms. I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years, but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. In my case, my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also. I'm left-handed, and so I draw. All my creations really start on small drawings, which I have thousands of, and it's my way of just thinking. I draw with a simple pencil, and at first, the Parkinson's was really upsetting, because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces. You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces. You think of yourself as the servant.TS: Nature is \u2014 well, it's a godsend. It just has so much in it. And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature, humans are of the universe. The universe is in our mind, and our minds are in the universe. And we are expressions of the universe, basically. As humans, ultimately being part of the universe, we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe. And to interface with it, with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do, giving them pigment and paint just like an artist, it's a good ally. It's a terrific studio assistant.JH: Well, I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand, some sort of more elemental force gets revealed, and that's the beauty here. Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.TS: Thank you, John.(Applause)", "id": 762, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nJohn Hockenberry:

00:05:13.958\nand it's more playful,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nbut inevitably,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nall of this can be used.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nI can redeem this

it,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nor you can have them wide open.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd all of the colors\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\ncome out one central

00:06:44.958\nTS: Well, this painting here,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nI wanted to do something very simple,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\na simple, iconic image\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nof two ripples interfering.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo the one on the right was done first,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand then the one on the left\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwas done over it.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd then I left gaps\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nso you could see the one that was done before.\n\n00:07:01.958 -->

00:07:09.958\ncrashing through the center of it --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nThere are lines in front of the one on the right,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nand there are lines behind the one on the left,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand so it takes it into different planes.\n\n00:07:23.958 -->

happens.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThere are shapes that come about\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\njust by the marriage\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nof two events that are

there.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nIf I throw a very concentric circle,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nor concentric ellipse,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nit just dutifully

works.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThere's something very appealing\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nabout the exactitude of science\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nthat I really

these paintings, when you look at them very close,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nodd things appear\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthat really look like horses or birds\n\n00:09:23.958 -->

cloud patterns,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nbut sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd then there are all these forms\n\n00:09:36.958 -->

with.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nAnd maybe it's the kind of forms\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nwe'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwhere there

One is the large global economy, the large globalized economy, and the other one is the small, and very limited, capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern, to shape, this economy. Because there is this asymmetry, which creates, basically, failing governance. Failing governance in many areas: in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment, in the area of exploitation of women and children, in the area of climate change, in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy, which is operating in a worldwide arena. And I think corruption, and the fight against corruption, and the impact of corruption, is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance.Let me talk about my own experience. I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa. At that time, I noticed that corruption, that grand corruption, that systematic corruption, was undermining everything we were trying to do. And therefore, I began to not only try to protect the work of the World Bank, our own projects, our own programs against corruption, but in general, I thought, \"We need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption.\" And as soon as I started this work, I received a memorandum from the World Bank, from the legal department first, in which they said, \"You are not allowed to do this. You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries. This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank, so I want you to stop your doings.\"In the meantime, I was chairing donor meetings, for instance, in which the various donors, and many of them like to be in Nairobi \u2014 it is true, it is one of the unsafest cities of the world, but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable. And in these donor meetings, I noticed that many of the worst projects \u2014 which were put forward by our clients, by the governments, by promoters, many of them representing suppliers from the North \u2014 that the worst projects were realized first. Let me give you an example: a huge power project, 300 million dollars, to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful, areas of western Kenya. And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects. To the contrary, we knew that this project would destroy the environment: It would destroy riparian forests, which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups, the Samburu and the Turkana in this area. So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project, this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project \u2014 not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars, and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools, like hospitals and so on. And yet, we all rejected this project, none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it, and it was the first project to be implemented.The good projects, which we as a donor community would take under our wings, they took years, you know, you had too many studies, and very often they didn't succeed. But these bad projects, which were absolutely damaging \u2014 for the economy for many generations, for the environment, for thousands of families who had to be resettled \u2014 they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks, of supplier agencies, of insurance agencies \u2014 like in Germany, Hermes, and so on \u2014 and they came back very, very quickly, driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North. Now, these suppliers were our big companies. They were the actors of this global market, which I mentioned in the beginning. They were the Siemenses of this world, coming from France, from the UK, from Japan, from Canada, from Germany, and they were systematically driven by systematic, large-scale corruption. We are not talking about 50,000 dollars here, or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there. No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars on the Swiss bank accounts, on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein, of the president's ministers, the high officials in the para-statal sectors.This was the reality which I saw, and not only one project like that: I saw, I would say, over the years I worked in Africa, I saw hundreds of projects like this. And so, I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries, which is the main reason for the misery, for the poverty, for the conflicts, for the violence, for the desperation in many of these countries. That we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line, that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world, twice that number, more than two billion people without sanitation and so on, and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children, still, child mortality of more than 10 million people every year, children dying before they are five years old: The cause of this is, to a large extent, grand corruption.Now, why did the World Bank not let me do this work? I found out afterwards, after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank. The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay, including Germany. In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed. It was even tax-deductible. No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany, but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed. Not all of them, but most of them. And this is the phenomenon which I call failing governance, because when I then came to Germany and started this little NGO here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig, we were told, \"You cannot stop our German exporters from bribing, because we will lose our contracts. We will lose to the French, we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese.\" And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma, which made it very difficult for an individual company, an individual exporting country to say, \"We are not going to continue this deadly, disastrous habit of large companies to bribe.\"So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure, because even the powerful government, which we have in Germany, comparatively, was not able to say, \"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.\" They needed help, and the large companies themselves have this dilemma. Many of them didn't want to bribe. Many of the German companies, for instance, believe that they are really producing a high-quality product at a good price, so they are very competitive. They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are, but they were not allowed to show their strengths, because the world was eaten up by grand corruption.And this is why I'm telling you this: Civil society rose to the occasion. We had this small NGO, Transparency International. They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma, and we developed concepts of collective action, basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table, explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing, and to make a long story short, we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters.In 1997, a convention, under the auspices of the OECD, which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery. (Applause) Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting, in doing this, we had to sit together with the companies. We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee, we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry, and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery. In the first session \u2014 we had three sessions over the course of two years. And President von Weizs\u00e4cker, by the way, chaired one of the sessions, the first one, to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs, who were not used to deal with non-governmental organizations. And in the first session, they all said, \"This is not bribery, what we are doing.\" This is customary there. This is what these other cultures demand. They even applaud it. In fact, [unclear] still says this today. And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing. But in the second session, they admitted already that they would never do this, what they are doing in these other countries, here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on. Cabinet ministers would admit this. And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute, we had them all sign an open letter to the Kohl government, at the time, requesting that they participate in the OECD convention.And this is, in my opinion, an example of soft power, because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us. We had a longer-term time perspective. We had a broader, geographically much wider, constituency we were trying to defend. And that's why the law has changed. That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in. In some other countries, the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced. And, again, civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment.In London, for instance, where the BAE got away with a huge corruption case, which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute, 100 million British pounds, every year for ten years, to one particular official of one particular friendly country, who then bought for 44 billion pounds of military equipment. This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK. Why? Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain. Civil society is pushing, civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem, also in the U.K., and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing, and so on.In Germany, we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention, which is a subsequent convention. We are, Germany, is not ratifying. Why? Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies. In Germany, we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant, but you are allowed to bribe a deputy. This is, under German law, allowed, and the members of our parliament don't want to change this, and this is why they can't sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery \u2014 one of they very, very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world, but not able to ratify the convention, which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world.I see my time is ticking. Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened. I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption, one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance. By now, the United Nations is totally on our side. The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn, they became, I would say, the strongest anti-corruption agency in the world. Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on. And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem, in the development of remedies, in the implementation of reforms, and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.Of course, if civil society organizations want to play that role, they have to grow into this responsibility. Not all civil society organizations are good. The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO. So, we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself. They have to have a much more transparent financial governance. They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations. We also need much more competence of civil society leaders. This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin, because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general, do not focus enough, yet, on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society.But what I'm saying from my very practical experience: If civil society does it right and joins the other actors \u2014 in particular, governments, governments and their international institutions, but also large international actors, in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility \u2014 then in this magical triangle between civil society, government and private sector, there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 763, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nI am going to speak about corruption,\n\n00:00:13.958 -->

--> 00:02:48.958\nit is true, it is one of the\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nunsafest cities of the world,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nbut they like to be there because the other cities\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nare even less comfortable.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nAnd in these donor meetings, I noticed\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat many of the worst projects --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nwhich were put forward\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nby our clients, by the governments,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nby promoters,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nmany of them representing\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nsuppliers from the North --\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthat the worst projects\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwere realized first.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nLet me give you an example:\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\na huge power project,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\n300 million dollars,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nto be built smack into\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\none of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nareas of western Kenya.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd we all noticed immediately\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nthat this project had no economic benefits:\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nIt had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nnobody was interested in irrigation projects.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nTo the contrary, we knew that this project\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwould destroy the environment:\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nIt would destroy riparian forests,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwhich were the basis for\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthe survival of nomadic groups,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthe Samburu and the Turkana in this area.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthis is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nnot to speak about the future indebtedness of the country\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nfor these hundreds of millions of dollars,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand the siphoning off\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nof the scarce resources of the economy\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nfrom much more important activities\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nlike schools, like hospitals and so on.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nAnd yet, we all rejected this project,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nnone of the donors was willing\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto have their name connected with it,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand it was the first project to be implemented.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThe good projects, which we as a donor community\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwould take under our wings,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nthey took years, you know,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nyou had too many studies,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand very often they didn't succeed.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nBut these bad projects,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nwhich were absolutely damaging -- for the economy\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nfor many generations, for the environment,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nfor thousands of families who had to be resettled --\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthey were suddenly put together\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nby consortia of banks,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nof supplier agencies,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nof insurance agencies --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nlike in Germany, Hermes, and so on --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand they came back very, very quickly,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\ndriven by an unholy alliance\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nbetween the powerful elites\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nin the countries there\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand the suppliers from the North.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nNow, these suppliers\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nwere our big companies.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThey were the actors of this global market,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwhich I mentioned in the beginning.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThey were the Siemenses of this world,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\ncoming from France, from the UK, from Japan,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nfrom Canada, from Germany,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand they were systematically driven\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nby systematic, large-scale corruption.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nWe are not talking about\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\n50,000 dollars here,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nor 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nNo, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\non the Swiss bank accounts,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\non the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nof the president's ministers,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthe high officials in the para-statal sectors.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThis was the reality which I saw,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand not only one project like that:\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nI saw, I would say,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nover the years I worked in Africa,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nI saw hundreds of projects like this.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd so, I became convinced\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthat it is this systematic corruption\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwhich is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwhich is the main reason\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nfor the misery, for the poverty,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nfor the conflicts, for the violence,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nfor the desperation\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nin many of these countries.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThat we have today\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nmore than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat we have more than a billion people\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nwithout proper drinking water in the world,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\ntwice that number,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nmore than two billion people\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nwithout sanitation and so on,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand the consequent illnesses\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nof mothers and children,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nstill, child mortality of more than\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\n10 million people every year,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nchildren dying before they are five years old:\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe cause of this is, to a large extent,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\ngrand corruption.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nNow, why did the World Bank\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nnot let me do this work?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI found out afterwards,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nafter I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThe reason was that the members of the World Bank\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthought that foreign bribery was okay,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nincluding Germany.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nIn Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nIt was even tax-deductible.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nNo wonder that most of the most important\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\ninternational operators in Germany,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbut also in France and the UK\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nNot all of them, but most of them.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd this is the phenomenon\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nwhich I call failing governance,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nbecause when I then came to Germany\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand started this little NGO\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nhere in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nwe were told, \"You cannot stop\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nour German exporters from bribing,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nbecause we will lose our contracts.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWe will lose to the French,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwe will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese.\"\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwhich made it very difficult\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nfor an individual company,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nan individual exporting country\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto say, \"We are not going to\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ncontinue this deadly, disastrous\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nhabit of large companies to bribe.\"\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nSo this is what I mean\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nwith a failing governance structure,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nbecause even the powerful government,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwhich we have in Germany, comparatively,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nwas not able to say,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\n\"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.\"\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nThey needed help,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand the large companies themselves\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nhave this dilemma.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nMany of them didn't want to bribe.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nMany of the German companies, for instance,\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nbelieve that they are really\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nproducing a high-quality product\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nat a good price, so they are very competitive.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nThey are not as good at bribing\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nas many of their international competitors are,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nbut they were not allowed\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nto show their strengths,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nbecause the world was eaten up\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nby grand corruption.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd this is why I'm telling you this:\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nCivil society rose to the occasion.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nWe had this small NGO,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nTransparency International.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nThey began to think of\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nan escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand we developed concepts\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nof collective action,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nbasically trying to bring various competitors\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\ntogether around the table,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nexplaining to all of them\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nhow much it would be in their interests\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nif they simultaneously would stop bribing,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand to make a long story short,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwe managed to eventually\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nget Germany to sign\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\ntogether with the other OECD countries\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand a few other exporters.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIn 1997, a convention,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nunder the auspices of the OECD,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwhich obliged everybody\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nto change their laws\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nand criminalize foreign bribery.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nWell, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nin doing this,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwe had to sit together with the companies.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nwe had sessions with about\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\n20 captains of industry,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand we discussed with them\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nwhat to do about international bribery.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIn the first session -- we had three sessions\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nover the course of two years.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd President von Weizs\u00e4cker, by the way,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nchaired one of the sessions, the first one,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nto take the fear away\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nfrom the entrepreneurs,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwho were not used to deal\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwith non-governmental organizations.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd in the first session, they all said,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n\"This is not bribery, what we are doing.\" This is customary there.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThis is what these other cultures demand.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nThey even applaud it.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nIn fact, [unclear]\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nstill says this today.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAnd so there are still a lot of people\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nwho are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nBut in the second session,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthey admitted already that they would never do this,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nwhat they are doing in these other countries,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nhere in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nCabinet ministers would admit this.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nAnd in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nwe had them all sign an open letter\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nto the Kohl government, at the time,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nrequesting that they\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nparticipate in the OECD convention.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd this is, in my opinion,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nan example of soft power,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nbecause we were able to convince them\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nthat they had to go with us.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nWe had a longer-term time perspective.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWe had a broader,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\ngeographically much wider,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nconstituency we were trying to defend.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd that's why the law has changed.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nThat's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nand that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nIn some other countries, the OECD convention\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nis not yet properly enforced.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd, again, civil societies\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nbreathing down the neck of the establishment.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIn London, for instance,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nwhere the BAE got away\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nwith a huge corruption case,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nwhich the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\n100 million British pounds,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nevery year for ten years,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nto one particular official of one particular friendly country,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nwho then bought for\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:24.958\n44 billion pounds of military equipment.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThis case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nWhy? Because they consider this\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nas contrary to the security interest\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nof the people of Great Britain.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nCivil society is pushing, civil society\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nis trying to get a solution to this problem,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nalso in the U.K.,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nand so on.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nIn Germany, we are pushing\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe ratification of the UN convention,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nwhich is a subsequent convention.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe are, Germany, is not ratifying.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nWhy? Because it would make it necessary\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nto criminalize the corruption\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nof deputies.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIn Germany, we have a system where\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nyou are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nbut you are allowed to bribe a deputy.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nThis is, under German law, allowed,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nand the members of our parliament don't want to change this,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand this is why they can't sign\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthe U.N. convention against foreign bribery --\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\none of they very, very few countries\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwhich is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nbut not able to ratify the convention,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nwhich we managed to get on the books\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nwith about 160 countries all over the world.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nI see my time is ticking.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nLet me just try to\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\ndraw some conclusions from what has happened.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nI believe that what we managed to achieve\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nin fighting corruption,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\none can also achieve\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nin other areas of failing governance.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nBy now, the United Nations\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nis totally on our side.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThe World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nthey became, I would say, the strongest\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nanti-corruption agency in the world.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nMost of the large companies\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nare now totally convinced\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nthat they have to put in place\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nvery strong policies\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nagainst bribery and so on.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nAnd this is possible because civil society\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\njoined the companies\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nand joined the government\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nin the analysis of the problem,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nin the development of remedies,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nin the implementation of reforms,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nand then later, in the monitoring of reforms.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nOf course, if civil society organizations\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nwant to play that role,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthey have to grow into this responsibility.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nNot all civil society organizations are good.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThe Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nSo, we must be aware\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nthat civil society\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nhas to shape up itself.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThey have to have a much more\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\ntransparent financial governance.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nThey have to have a much more participatory governance\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nin many civil society organizations.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nWe also need much more competence of civil society leaders.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThis is why we have set up the governance school\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nand the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nbecause we believe most of our educational\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nand research institutions in Germany\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand continental Europe in general,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\ndo not focus enough, yet,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\non empowering civil society\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand training the leadership of civil society.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nBut what I'm saying from my very practical experience:\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nIf civil society does it right\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nand joins the other actors --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nin particular, governments,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\ngovernments and their international institutions,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut also large international actors,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nin particular those which have committed themselves\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nto corporate social responsibility --\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nthen in this magical triangle\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbetween civil society,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\ngovernment and private sector,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthere is a tremendous chance\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nfor all of us to create a better world.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Teach every child about food", "duration": "1313", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_oliver", "transcript": "Sadly, in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat, four Americans that are alive will be dead through the food that they eat.My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm 34 years old. I'm from Essex in England and for the last seven years I've worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way. I'm not a doctor; I'm a chef, I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information, education.I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful, awful reality right now. America, you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today? Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up, aunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We, the adults of the last four generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents. Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we've built around them. Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically overweight or obese. You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.(Laughter)The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid about death, murder, homicide, you name it; it's on the front page of every paper, CNN. Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake. Right?(Laughter)(Applause)Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease. Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that. Fact: diet-related disease is the biggest killer in the United States, right now, here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you, as usual.(Laughter)I know they were close, but not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems of obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your health-care bills, 150 billion dollars a year. In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year. Let's be honest, guys, you haven't got that cash.(Laughter)I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping-point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America for seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe \u2014 ripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia, the most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year, but we'll work on that next season.(Laughter)Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people, your public, around the statistics that we've become so used to. I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about: your public, your children. I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany. She's 16 years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up within a food environment where they've been taught to cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death.Stacy, the Edwards family. This is a normal family, guys. Stacy does her best, but she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook at home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds. He gets bullied, for God's sake. The daughter there, Katie, she's four years old. She's obese before she even gets to primary school. Marissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot. But you know what? Her father, who was obese, died in her arms, And then the second most important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families, brothers, sisters.Pastor Steve: an inspirational man, one of my early allies in Huntington, West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem. He has to bury the people, OK? And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends, his family, his community. Come winter, three times as many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease. Waste of life. By the way, this is what they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door, and I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift.OK, I see it as a triangle, OK? This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped the heart out of this country? Let's be frank and honest. Well, modern-day life.Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over the whole country; we know that. The big brands are some of the most important powers, powerful powers, in this country.(Sighs)Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed and full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients, and you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously a massive, massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country is a disgrace. The industry wants to self-police themselves. What, in this kind of climate? They don't deserve it. How can you say something is low-fat when it's full of so much sugar?Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food culture, what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know, as we go to work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have to look at it holistically \u2014 step back for a moment, and re-address the balance. It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now; the Edwards family.(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk. This stuff goes through you and your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early. How are you feeling?Stacy: Just feeling really sad and depressed right now. But, you know, I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them.JO: Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much a specialist in. OK, school. What is school? Who invented it? What's the purpose of school? School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc. You know, it's been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long, long time, OK? But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America, OK? School food is something that most kids \u2014 31 million a day, actually \u2014 have twice a day, more than often, breakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year. So you could say that school food is quite important, really, judging the circumstances.(Laughter)Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for \u2014(Laughter)I need to say one thing, and it's so important in, hopefully, the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies, the lunch cooks of America \u2014 I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being told to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any, food-knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem: If you're not a food expert, and you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter, then you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive and write different things around things. If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit.Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get every day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough fresh food in there at all. You know, the amount of additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe \u2014 there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery. Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No. And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld. And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.(Sighs)Ten percent of what we spend on health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right to teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK? We don't teach kids about food, right? And this is a little clip from an elementary school, which is very common in England.(Video) Who knows what this is?Child: Potatoes.Jamie Oliver: Potato? So, you think these are potatoes? Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is?Child: Broccoli?JO: What about this? Our good old friend.Child: Celery.JO: No. What do you think this is?Child: Onion. JO: Onion? No.JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense of \"Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?\" Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it.(Laughter)JO: Normal. England and America, England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one-hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids about food in schools, period.(Applause)I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we're in, guys, OK? I want to talk about something so basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk at school, breakfast and lunch, right? They'll be having two bottles, OK? And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong, I support milk \u2014 but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it. Yeah.Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean? For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk. Okay? There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs of those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped the kind of modern-day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop, and they are having two a day. So, let me just show you. We've got one kid, here \u2014 having, you know, eight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know, there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar, just from milk. Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics and the evidence, and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief.(Applause)(Applause ends)Now, if I came up here, and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting and scrambling to get to me. This, all this bad news, is preventable. That's the good news. It's very, very preventable. So, let's just think about, we got a problem here, we need to reboot. Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do? Here is the thing, right, it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say, \"In 10 years' time, the history of your children's lives, happiness \u2014 and let's not forget, you're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer \u2014 all of that stuff, it will look different. OK?\"So, supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously? Week in, week out. How much money do you spend, in your life, in a supermarket? Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook quick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some, and it needs to be done across the board in America soon, and quick. The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education at the heart of their businesses. I know, easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way.Fast food. With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive. I've had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean, basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar, salt and fat, and x, y, and z, and everyone loves them, right? So, these guys are going to be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar and all the other non-food ingredients.Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier, is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK, school. Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year, from that little precious age of four, until 18, 20, 24, whatever, they need to be cooked proper, fresh food from local growers on site, OK? There needs to be a new standard of fresh, proper food for your children, yeah?(Applause)Under the circumstances, it's profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life. Life skills.(Applause)That means that they can be students, young parents, and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking, no matter what recession hits them next time. If you can cook, recession money doesn't matter. If you can cook, time doesn't matter. The workplace, we haven't really talked about it. You know, it's now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads of America's children. Marissa, her father died in her hand, I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home.Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure. For sure, pass it on as a philosophy. And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole population of America. Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington, where I made this program, we've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area from the junk, onto the fresh food: six-and-a-half grand per school.(Applause)That's all it takes, six-and-a-half grand per school. The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay? This can do 5,000 people a year, which is 10 percent of their population, and it's people on people. You know, it's local cooks teaching local people. It's free cooking lessons, guys, in the Main Street. This is real, tangible change, real, tangible change. Around America, if we just look back now, there is plenty of wonderful things going on. There is plenty of beautiful things going on. There are angels around America doing great things in schools \u2014 farm-to-school set-ups, garden set-ups, education \u2014 there are amazing people doing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they're already doing, and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do.(Applause)And look, I know it's weird having an English person standing here before you talking about all this. All I can say is: I care. I'm a father, and I love this country. And I believe truly, actually, that if change can be made in this country, beautiful things will happen around the world. If America does it, other people will follow. It's incredibly important.(Audience) Yeah!(Applause)When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work when they weren't, I thought \"If I had a magic wand, what would I do?\" And I thought, \"You know what? I'd just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America.\" And a month later, TED phoned me up and gave me this award. I'm here. So, my wish. Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong, sustainable movement to educate every child about food, to inspire families to cook again, and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause continues)", "id": 765, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.874\nSadly,\n\n00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.161\nin the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,\n\n00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.874\nfour Americans that are alive\n\n00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:23.946\nwill be dead through\nthe food that they eat.\n\n00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.964\nMy name's Jamie Oliver.\n\n00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:29.121\nI'm 34 years old.\n\n00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.874\nI'm from Essex in England\n\n00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.874\nand for the last seven years\n\n00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:40.256\nI've worked fairly tirelessly\nto save lives in my own way.\n\n00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.874\nI'm not a doctor;\n\n00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:44.075\nI'm a chef,\n\n00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:46.621\nI don't have expensive equipment\n\n00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:47.715\nor medicine.\n\n00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.984\nI use information, education.\n\n00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:54.200\nI profoundly believe\nthat the power of food\n\n00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:57.399\nhas a primal place in our homes\n\n00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:01.874\nthat binds us to the best bits of life.\n\n00:01:03.818 --> 00:01:09.188\nWe have an awful, awful reality right now.\n\n00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:13.453\nAmerica, you're at the top of your game.\n\n00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:16.885\nThis is one of the most unhealthy\ncountries in the world.\n\n00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:20.234\nCan I please just see a raise of hands\n\n00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:22.837\nfor how many of you have\nchildren in this room today?\n\n00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:23.961\nPut your hands up.\n\n00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:27.671\nYou can continue to put your hands up,\naunties and uncles as well.\n\n00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.207\nMost of you.

parents,\n\n00:17:01.284 --> 00:17:05.523\nand be able to sort of duck and dive\naround the basics of cooking,\n\n00:17:05.547 --> 00:17:07.650\nno matter what recession hits\nthem next time.\n\n00:17:07.674 --> 00:17:10.056\nIf you can cook,\nrecession money doesn't matter.\n\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.551\nIf you can cook, time doesn't matter.\n\n00:17:14.093 --> 00:17:16.538\nThe workplace, we haven't\nreally talked about it.\n\n00:17:16.562 --> 00:17:20.124\nYou know, it's now time\nfor corporate responsibility\n\n00:17:20.148 --> 00:17:24.172\nto really look at what they feed\nor make available to their staff.\n\n00:17:24.196 --> 00:17:27.506\nThe staff are the moms and dads\nof America's children.\n\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.689\nMarissa, her father died in her hand,\n\n00:17:29.713 --> 00:17:31.690\nI think she'd be quite happy\n\n00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:34.874\nif corporate America could start\nfeeding their staff properly.\n\n00:17:34.898 --> 00:17:36.874\nDefinitely they shouldn't be left out.\n\n00:17:36.898 --> 00:17:38.464\nLet's go back to the home.\n\n00:17:38.488 --> 00:17:40.728\nNow, look, if we do\nall this stuff, and we

00:17:49.657\nBut the home needs to start passing on\ncooking again, for sure.\n\n00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:51.657\nFor sure, pass it on as a philosophy.\n\n00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.815\nAnd for me, it's quite romantic,\n\n00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.232\nbut it's about if one person\nteaches three people\n\n00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:57.874\nhow to cook something,\n\n00:17:57.898 --> 00:17:59.638\nand they teach three of their mates,\n\n00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.986\nthat only has to repeat itself 25 times,\n\n00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.265\nand that's the whole\npopulation of America.\n\n00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:08.589\nRomantic, yes, but most importantly,\n\n00:18:08.613 --> 00:18:11.304\nit's about trying to get people to realize\n\n00:18:11.328 --> 00:18:14.312\nthat every one of your individual efforts\nmakes a difference.\n\n00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:16.536\nWe've got to put back what's been lost.\n\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.252\nHuntington's Kitchen.\n\n00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:21.164\nHuntington, where I made this program,\n\n00:18:21.188 --> 00:18:22.775\nwe've got this prime-time program\n\n00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:25.987\nthat hopefully will inspire people\nto really get on this change.\n\n00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:28.042\nI truly believe that change will happen.\n\n00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.233\nHuntington's Kitchen.\nI work with a community.\n\n00:18:30.257 --> 00:18:31.738\nI worked in the schools.\n\n00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:34.027\nI found local sustainable funding\n\n00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:38.337\nto get every single school

In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work on redefining the way maps work online. And we really are seeing this in very different terms from the kind of mapping and direction site that one is used to.So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning, which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon, that's where it comes from.Mapping is, of course, not just about cartography, it's also about imagery. So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like virtual view at 45 degrees. This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades. Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment, as being a canvas on which all sorts of applications can play out, and map's directions are really just one of them.If you click on this, you'll see some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months since we've launched. So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti, we had an earthquake map that showed before and after pictures from the sky. This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you is taking hyper-local blogs in real time and mapping those stories, those entries to the places that are referred to on the blogs. It's wonderful.But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.So, we see the imagery, of course, not stopping at the sky. These little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made. I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map. Everything that's cased in blue is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.And so, when you fly down \u2014(Applause)Thank you. When you fly down to the ground, and you see this kind of panoramic imagery, the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture, there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-dimensional city from above, so if I click on something to get a closer view of it, then, the fact that that transition looks as it does, is a function of all of that geometry, all of that 3D understanding behind this model.Now, I'll show you a fun app that \u2014 we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr. This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery and uses photosynth-like processes to connect that imagery to our imagery, so \u2014 I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but \u2014(Laughter)But notice \u2014 this is, of course, a popular tourist site, and there are lots of photos around here, and these photos are all taken at different times. So this one was taken around five. So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery. So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)There are several reasons why this is interesting and one of them, of course, is time travel. And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here, but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well. But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting this visual representation of the world with things that are coming in from users, but it also is the foundation for augmented reality, and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting. OK, notice there's now a roof above us. We're inside the Pike Place Market. And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera, so, we're now not only imaging in the street with this camera on tops of cars, but we're also imaging inside. And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration, not only of still images, but also of video.So this is something that we're now going to try for the first time, live, and this is really, truly, very frightening.(Laughter)OK.(Ringing)All right, guys, are you there?(Noise)All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play. I'm live. All right. There we go. So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.(Applause)So they're broadcasting this live. OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market? Because I want to show points of interest. No, no. The other way. Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner. I don't want to see you guys yet. OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner. OK, never mind.What I wanted to show you was these points of interest over here on top of the image because what that gives you a sense of is the way, if you're actually on the spot, you can think about this \u2014 this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.What the hell are you guys \u2014 oh, sorry.(Laughter)We're doing two different \u2014 OK, I'm hanging up now. We're doing two different things here. One of them is to take that real ...(Laughter)All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team. They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.(Applause)I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside. And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that here we're using this for telepresence, but you can equally well use this on the spot, for augmented reality. When you use it on the spot, it means that you're able to bring all of that metadata and information about the world to you. So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it. That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network from the market.All right, and now there's one last TED talk that Microsoft has given in the past several years. And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope. So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters, where it's traditional, after a long day at the market, to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky. This is the integration of WorldWide Telescope into our maps.(Applause)This is the current \u2014 thank you \u2014 this is the current time. If we scrub the time, then we can see how the sky will look at different times, and we can get all of this very detailed information about different times, different dates: Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky, maybe change the date. I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon. So, this is an astronomically complete representation of the sky integrated right into the Earth.All right now, I've overrun my time, so I've got to stop. Thank you all very much.(Applause)", "id": 766, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nAbout a year and a half ago,\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nStephen Lawler, who also gave a talk\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nhere at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nbrought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nwhich is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nIn the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.958\non redefining the way maps work online.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd we really are seeing this in very different terms\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nfrom the kind of mapping and direction site\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nthat one is used to.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nSo, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nis just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nwhich, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nthat's where it comes from.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nMapping is, of course,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nnot just about cartography,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nit's also about imagery.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nSo, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nthis resolves into a kind of Sim City-like\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nvirtual view at 45 degrees.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThis can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nto show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nNow, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nas being a canvas on which\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nall sorts of applications can play out,\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand map's directions are really just one of them.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nIf you click on this, you'll see\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nsome of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nsince we've launched.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nSo, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nwe had an earthquake map that showed\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nbefore and after pictures from the sky.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThis wonderful one which I don't have time to show you\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nis taking hyper-local blogs in real time\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nand mapping those stories, those entries\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nto the places that are referred to on the blogs.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nIt's wonderful.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nBut I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nSo, we see the imagery, of course,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nnot stopping at the sky.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nThese little green bubbles represent\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nphotosynths that users have made.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nI'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nEverything that's cased in blue\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nis an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd so, when you fly down --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nThank you.

That's also interesting.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nOK, notice there's now a roof above us.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nWe're inside the Pike Place Market.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nAnd this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nso, we're now not only imaging in the street\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwith this camera on tops of cars,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbut we're also imaging inside.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nnot only of still images, but also of video.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nSo this is something that we're now going to try\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nfor the first time, live,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand this is really, truly, very frightening.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nOK.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n(Ringing)\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAll right, guys, are you there?\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\n(Noise)\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAll right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nI'm live. All right. There we go.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nSo, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:07.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo they're broadcasting this live.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nOK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBecause I want to show points of interest.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nNo, no. The other way.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nYeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nI don't want to see you guys yet.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nOK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nOK, never mind.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nWhat I wanted to show you was these points of interest\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nover here on top of the image\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbecause what that gives you a sense of is the way,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nif you're actually on the spot,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nyou can think about this --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthis is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nWhat the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nWe're doing two different --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nOK, I'm hanging up now.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe're doing two different things here.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nOne of them is to take that real ...\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nAll right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThey've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nI'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd while I walk outside, I'll just mention that\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nhere we're using this for telepresence,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbut you can equally well use this\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\non the spot, for augmented reality.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nWhen you use it on the spot, it means that\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nyou're able to bring all of that metadata\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nand information about the world to you.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nSo here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nThat was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nfrom the market.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAll right, and now there's one last TED talk\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthat Microsoft has given in the past several years.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSo, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nwhere it's traditional, after a long day at the market,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nto go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nThis is the integration\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nof WorldWide Telescope into our maps.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThis is the current -- thank you --\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nthis is the current time. If we scrub the time,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nthen we can see how the sky will look at different times,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand we can get all of this very detailed\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\ninformation about different times, different dates:\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nLet's move the moon a little higher in the sky,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nmaybe change the date.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nI would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nSo, this is an astronomically complete\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nrepresentation of the sky\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nintegrated right into the Earth.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAll right now, I've overrun my time,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nso I've got to stop.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThank you all very much.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:08:00.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The next age of government", "duration": "839", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_cameron", "transcript": "Someone once said that politics is, of course, \"showbiz for ugly people.\" So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived. The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician, to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K., where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. And someone asked,\"Why?\" and they said, \"Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.\" (Laughter)Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide. This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind in British politics or American politics, and that is: We have run out of money. We have vast budget deficits. This is my global public debt clock, and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.And I think what this leads to is a very simple recognition, that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other, and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money? Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services, or to improve government, or to improve so many of the things that politicians talk about. So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money \u2014 you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money, you can only measure progress by spending money \u2014 you're going to have a pretty miserable time.But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being \u2014 things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values \u2014 then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics. And the really simple argument I want to make tonight, the really straightforward argument is this: That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking, with the incredible information revolution that has taken place, and that all of you know so much more about than I do, I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics, remake government, remake public services, and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being. That's the argument I want to make tonight.So, starting with the political philosophy. Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers. Of course we don't. But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy that are really relevant to this whole debate. The first is this: We believe that if you give people more power and control over their lives, if you give people more choice, if you put them in the driving seat, then actually, you can create a stronger and better society. And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today, I think you can completely, as I've said, remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature. Politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are, rather than as they would like them to be. Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought \u2014 go with the grain of human nature \u2014 with all the advances in behavioral economics, some of which we were just hearing about, again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being, in happiness, in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument? Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson about what I would say are the three passages of history: the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age. A simpler way of thinking of it is that we have gone from a world of local control, then we went to a world of central control, and now we're in a world of people control. Local power, central power, now, people power.Now, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago. Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves. Couldn't actually turn back very much, because if you were king a thousand years ago, while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country, there wasn't much you were in charge of. You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare. You could just about go to war and that was about it. This was the pre-bureaucratic age, an age in which everything had to be local. You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information because travel was so restricted. So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.Next part of the cold history lesson, the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution. Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible, and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age. And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are. Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state. It was able \u2014 but only it was able \u2014 to organize health care, education, policing, justice. And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power. It had sucked all that power up from the localities. It was able to do that itself.The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with: the massive information revolution. Just consider this one fact: One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars. Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else, and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost, and we can send and receive huge quantities of information without it costing anything. So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age, where genuine people power is possible.Now, what does this mean for our politics, for our public services, for our government? Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples, but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change. And this is so obvious, in a way, because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done. That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways, but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.So, how could this happen? Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference: in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability, in giving us that genuine people power. If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites, the Missouri Accountability Portal. In the old days, only the government could hold the information, and only a few elected people could try and grab that information and question it and challenge it. Now here, on one website, one state in America, every single dollar spent by that government is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.Think of the huge change that means: Any business that wants to bid for a government contract can see what currently is being spent. Anyone thinking, \"I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,\" it's all available there. We have only, in government and in politics, started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world with the information revolution. So, complete transparency will make a huge difference. In this country, if we win the election, we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds transparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see. We're going to make every contract \u2014 we're announcing this today \u2014 available on the Internet so anyone can see what the terms are, what the conditions are, driving huge value for money, but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.Choice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online, and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education, or health care or policing, and you're going to see this change massively. We should be making this change with the information revolution in our country, with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly, what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals, who does best at infection control \u2014 all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health is now available for all of us to see.And the third of these big changes: accountability. This, I think, is a huge change. It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago. So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where, and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account, suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power, where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed \u2014 where, when and by whom \u2014 and we can hold the police to account. And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat, but actually that's an assault, the one in blue. You can see what crime is committed where, and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account. So those three ways \u2014 transparency, accountability and choice \u2014 will make a huge difference.Now I also said the other principle that I think we should work on is understanding of people, is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature you can achieve so much more. Now, we're got a huge revolution in understanding of why people behave in the way that they do, and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use. We're working with some of these people. We're being advised by some of these people, as was said, to try and bring all the experience to book.Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love. We want to get people to be more energy efficient. Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills, and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time. How do you do it? Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home. We even had \u2014 one government minister once told us to brush our teeth in the dark. I don't think they lasted very long. Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics. The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending, to show them what their neighbors are spending, and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending. That sort of behavioral economics can transform people's behavior in a way that all the bullying and all the information and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve. Other examples are recycling. We all know we need to recycle more. How do we make it happen? All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle, if you give them a carrot rather than a stick, you can transform their behavior.So what does all this add up to? Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years. Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple and powerful formulation, \"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,\" an incredibly noble sentiment. But when he made that speech, what could you do to build the stronger, better society? You could fight for your country, you could die for your country, you could serve in your country's civil service, but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.And I think an even more wonderful speech, which I'm going to read a big chunk of, which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money, and more that we should try and measure than money. And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little: It \"does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.\"Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago, and a beautiful dream 40 years ago, but now with the huge advances in information technology, with the massive changes in behavioral economics, with all that we know about how you advance well-being, that if we combine those insights of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible, and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature, while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do, it is a dream more easy to realize today than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.Thank you.

people.\"\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nSo, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nThe other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nto give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nwhere the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nThere was even a story recently that scientists had thought about\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nactually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAnd someone asked,\"Why?\"\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nand they said, \"Well, there's no shortage of politicians,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nno one really minds what happens to them\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.\"\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nNow, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nThis, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nin British politics or American politics,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand that is: We have run out of money.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nWe have vast budget deficits.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nThis is my global public debt clock,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd I think what this leads to\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nis a very simple recognition,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nthat there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nand it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nBecause there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nor to improve government, or to improve so many of the things\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthat politicians talk about.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nSo what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nyou can only measure success in public services\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nin health care and education and policing by spending more money,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nyou can only measure progress by spending money --\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nyou're going to have a pretty miserable time.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nBut if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being --\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nthings like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthen, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd the really simple argument I want to make tonight,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nthe really straightforward argument is this:\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nThat if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nwith the incredible information revolution that has taken place,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand that all of you know so much more about than I do,\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nI think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nremake government, remake public services,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nThat's the argument I want to make tonight.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nSo, starting with the political philosophy.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nNow I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nOf course we don't.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nBut there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat are really relevant to this whole debate.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThe first is this: We believe that if you give people\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nmore power and control over their lives,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nif you give people more choice,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nif you put them in the driving seat,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthen actually, you can create a stronger and better society.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nAnd if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nof information that we have in our world today,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nI think you can completely, as I've said,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nremake politics, remake government, remake your public services.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThe second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nPolitics and politicians will only succeed\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nif they actually try and treat with people as they are,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nrather than as they would like them to be.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nNow, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ngo with the grain of human nature --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwith all the advances in behavioral economics,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nsome of which we were just hearing about,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nagain, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nin happiness, in a stronger society\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nwithout necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nNow, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nWell, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nabout what I would say are the three passages of history:\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthe pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nA simpler way of thinking of it\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nis that we have gone from a world of local control,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthen we went to a world of central control,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand now we're in a world of people control.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nLocal power, central power, now, people power.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nNow, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nThought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nCouldn't actually turn back very much,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbecause if you were king a thousand years ago,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nwhile it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nthere wasn't much you were in charge of.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nYou weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nYou could just about go to war and that was about it.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nThis was the pre-bureaucratic age,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nan age in which everything had to be local.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nYou had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbecause travel was so restricted.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo this was the pre-bureaucratic age.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nNext part of the cold history lesson,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nthe lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nSuddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nAnd hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nSuddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nIt was able -- but only it was able -- to organize\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nhealth care, education, policing, justice.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nAnd it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nIt had sucked all that power up from the localities.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIt was able to do that itself.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThe next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthe massive information revolution.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nJust consider this one fact:\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nOne hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nRight now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nand all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand we can send and receive huge quantities of information\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nwithout it costing anything.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nSo we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwhere genuine people power is possible.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nNow, what does this mean for our politics,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nfor our public services, for our government?\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nWell I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nbut let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nAnd this is so obvious, in a way, because\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nyou think about how all of you have changed\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthe way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThat is already happened; the information and Internet revolution\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nhas actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nbut it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, how could this happen?\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nWell, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nin transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nin giving us that genuine people power.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nIf we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nthe Missouri Accountability Portal.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nIn the old days, only the government could hold the information,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand only a few elected people could try and grab that information\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand question it and challenge it.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nNow here, on one website, one state in America,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nevery single dollar spent by that government\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nis searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThink of the huge change that means:\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nAny business that wants to bid for a government contract\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\ncan see what currently is being spent.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnyone thinking, \"I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,\"\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nit's all available there.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWe have only, in government and in politics,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nstarted to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nwith the information revolution.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nSo, complete transparency will make a huge difference.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nIn this country, if we win the election,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nwe are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\ntransparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\navailable on the Internet so anyone can see\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwhat the terms are, what the conditions are,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\ndriving huge value for money,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nbut also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nChoice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nand yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nof public services like education, or health care or policing,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nand you're going to see this change massively.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWe should be making this change\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nwith the information revolution in our country,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nwith searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nwhat records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nwho does best at infection control --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nall of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nis now available for all of us to see.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nAnd the third of these big changes: accountability.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nThis, I think, is a huge change.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nIt is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nSo, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nabout which crimes are committed where,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand we have to employ people in government\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nto try and hold the police to account,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nsuddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nwhere we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhere, when and by whom --\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand we can hold the police to account.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nbut actually that's an assault, the one in blue.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nYou can see what crime is committed where,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSo those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nwill make a huge difference.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nNow I also said the other principle\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthat I think we should work on is understanding of people,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nis recognizing that going with the grain of human nature\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nyou can achieve so much more.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nNow, we're got a huge revolution in understanding\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nof why people behave in the way that they do,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe're working with some of these people.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nWe're being advised by some of these people, as was said,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nto try and bring all the experience to book.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nLet me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nWe want to get people to be more energy efficient.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nWhy? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nHow do you do it?\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nWell, we've had government information campaigns over the years\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwhen they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nWe even had -- one government minister once told us to\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nbrush our teeth in the dark.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI don't think they lasted very long.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nLook at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThe best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nis to show them their own spending,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nto show them what their neighbors are spending,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThat sort of behavioral economics\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\ncan transform people's behavior\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nin a way that all the bullying and all the information\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nOther examples are recycling.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nWe all know we need to recycle more.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nHow do we make it happen?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAll the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nif you give them a carrot rather than a stick,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nyou can transform their behavior.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo what does all this add up to?\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nHere are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nObviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand powerful formulation,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:51.958\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,\"\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nan incredibly noble sentiment.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nBut when he made that speech, what could you do\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nto build the stronger, better society?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nYou could fight for your country, you could die for your country,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nyou could serve in your country's civil service,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nbut you didn't really have the information and the knowledge\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd I think an even more wonderful speech,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nwhich I'm going to read a big chunk of,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhich sums up what I said at the beginning\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nabout believing there is more to life than money,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand more that we should try and measure than money.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nof why gross national product captures so little:\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nIt \"does not allow for the health of our children,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nthe quality of their education, or the joy of their play.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nIt does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nthe intelligence of our public debate.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nIt measures neither our wit nor our courage,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nneither our wisdom nor our learning,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nneither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nIt measures everything, in short,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nexcept that which makes life worthwhile.\"\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAgain, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand a beautiful dream 40 years ago,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nbut now with the huge advances in information technology,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nwith the massive changes in behavioral economics,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwith all that we know about how you advance well-being,\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthat if we combine those insights\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nof giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwhile at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nit is a dream more easy to realize today\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthan it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The opportunity of adversity", "duration": "1318", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/aimee_mullins_the_opportunity_of_adversity", "transcript": "I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything, but I'd already finished editing the piece, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word \"disabled\" to see what I'd find.Let me read you the entry. \"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked, stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated, run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped, senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in cracked-up, counted-out; see also hurt, useless and weak. Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable.\" I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing, it was so ludicrous, but I'd just gotten past \"mangled,\" and my voice broke, and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right? But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s, when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me. And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then. I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured.So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision worth noting. Here's the updated version of this entry. Unfortunately, it's not much better. I find the last two words under \"Near Antonyms,\" particularly unsettling: \"whole\" and \"wholesome.\"So, it's not just about the words. It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words. It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values. Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people. In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans, believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful, because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. So, what reality do we want to call into existence: a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered? By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child, we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware. His name was Dr. Pizzutillo, an Italian American, whose name, apparently, was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce, so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital, with the exception of my physical therapy sessions. I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick, elastic bands \u2014 different colors, you know \u2014 to help build up my leg muscles, and I hated these bands more than anything \u2014 I hated them, had names for them. I hated them. And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child, with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises, unsuccessfully, of course. And, one day, he came in to my session \u2014 exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions \u2014 and he said to me, \"Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl, I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.\"Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries, our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want, the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society, many of which have been brought about by technology. Certainly, from a medical standpoint, my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment, titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities, and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them \u2014 not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves, so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth: that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society, and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing, because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity, and I'm going to make an admission: This phrase never sat right with me, and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of \"overcoming adversity\" is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience, as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics, or what other people perceive as my disability. But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge, whether physically, emotionally or both. And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. It's part of our life. And I tend to think of it like my shadow. Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little, but it's always with me. And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.There is adversity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and relative to every single person, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity, but how you're going to meet it. So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity, but preparing them to meet it well. And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis, or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself.By not treating the wholeness of a person, by not acknowledging their potency, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. And, most importantly, there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability. So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grappling with it, to use a wrestling term, maybe even dancing with it. And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful, we're less burdened by the presence of it.This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin, and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution, that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character. To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor is it the most intelligent that survives; it is the one that is most adaptable to change. Conflict is the genesis of creation. From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill. And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of. Maybe that's what adversity gives us: a sense of self, a sense of our own power. So, we can give ourselves a gift. We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Maybe we can see it as change. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. Now, who's normal? There's no normal. There's common, there's typical. There's no normal, and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed? (Laughter) I don't think so. If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility \u2014 or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous \u2014 we can release the power of so many more children, and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use, to be able to contribute. There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago, carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury, and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. They didn't view these people as broken and useless; they were seen as rare and valuable.A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime: I had shorts on. I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, \"Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins.\" And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.And I said, \"I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you.\"He said, \"Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me. I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.\" (Laughter) Oh, that guy. And, but of course, actually, it did click.This man was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer \u2014 this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.He said to me, \"I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since.\" (Laughter) (Applause)The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood, whether winning a second grade spelling bee, marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade, winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories, and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students, med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School. And he called this part of the course the X Factor, the potential of the human will. No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. And Dr. Kean went on to tell me, he said, \"In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise, and even if given a modicum of support, if left to their own devices, a child will achieve.\"See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking. He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure. And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.See, all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off. If you can hand somebody the key to their own power \u2014 the human spirit is so receptive \u2014 if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you are educating them in the best sense. You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. In fact, the exact meaning of the word \"educate\" comes from the root word \"educe.\" It means \"to bring forth what is within, to bring out potential.\" So again, which potential do we want to bring out?There was a case study done in 1960s Britain, when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. It's called the streaming trials. We call it \"tracking\" here in the States. It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on. And the \"A students\" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc. Well, they took, over a three-month period, D-level students, gave them A's, told them they were \"A's,\" told them they were bright, and at the end of this three-month period, they were performing at A-level.And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study, is that they took the \"A students\" and told them they were \"D's.\" And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period. Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out. A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too. The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. They were simply told, \"These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'\" And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit, a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope, it doesn't see beauty, it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imaginative, then we are truly using our power well. When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities and new ways of being.I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about, and the poem is called \"The God Who Only Knows Four Words\": \"Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don'ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come dance with me. Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'\"Thank you.

ago\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nwhile writing an article for Italian Wired.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nbut I'd already finished editing the piece,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand I realized that I had never once in my life\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nlooked up the word \"disabled\" to see what I'd find.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nLet me read you the entry.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:45.958\n\"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless,

laughing,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nit was so ludicrous,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nbut I'd just gotten past \"mangled,\" and my voice broke,\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nand I had to stop and collect myself\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nfrom the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nYou know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nso I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nBut, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nwhen I would have been starting primary school\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nand as related to the other kids and the world around me.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nAnd, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nthat perceived someone like me\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nto have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nwhen in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nmy life has procured.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nSo, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nexpecting to find a revision worth noting.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nHere's the updated version of this entry.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nUnfortunately, it's not much better.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nI find the last two words under \"Near Antonyms,\" particularly unsettling:\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\n\"whole\" and \"wholesome.\"\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nSo, it's not just about the words.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nIt's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIt's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nOur language affects our thinking and how we view the world\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand how we view other people.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nIn fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nbelieved that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbecause to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nSo, what reality do we want to call into existence:\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\na person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nBy casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwe might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nWouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nOne such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nat the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nHis name was Dr. Pizzutillo,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nan Italian American, whose name, apparently,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nwas too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nso he went by Dr. P.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand had the very perfect disposition to work with children.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nI loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nwith the exception of my physical therapy sessions.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nI had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwith these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nyou know -- to help build up my leg muscles,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nand I hated these bands more than anything --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nI hated them, had names for them. I hated them.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwith Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nunsuccessfully, of course.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd, one day, he came in to my session --\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nexhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nand he said to me, \"Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nI think you're going to break one of those bands.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nWhen you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.\"\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nNow, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nto get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nbefore the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbut what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\ninto a new and promising experience for me.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nAnd I have to wonder today to what extent his vision\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nshaped my own view of myself\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nas an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nThis is an example of how adults in positions of power\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ncan ignite the power of a child.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nBut, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nour language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nthe possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nOur language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nmany of which have been brought about by technology.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nCertainly, from a medical standpoint,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nmy legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\ntitanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nthat are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nnot to mention social networking platforms\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nallow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nso they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nSo, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwhat has always been a truth:\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthat everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThe human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nbecause people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand I'm going to make an admission:\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThis phrase never sat right with me,\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand I think I'm starting to figure out why.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nImplicit in this phrase of \"overcoming adversity\"\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nis the idea that success, or happiness,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nis about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nunscathed or unmarked by the experience,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nas if my successes in life have come about from an ability\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nto sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nor what other people perceive as my disability.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nBut, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwhether physically, emotionally or both.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAdversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nin order to resume living our life.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nIt's part of our life.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd I tend to think of it like my shadow.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nSometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nbut it's always with me.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nAnd, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThere is adversity and challenge in life,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand it's all very real and relative to every single person,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nbut the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nbut how you're going to meet it.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nSo, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nbut preparing them to meet it well.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd we do a disservice to our kids\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nwhen we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThere's an important difference and distinction\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nbetween the objective medical fact of my being an amputee\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nis the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIn our desire to protect those we care about\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nby giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nor, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwe have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthat will actually disable someone.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nPerhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nthan the pathology itself.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nBy not treating the wholeness of a person,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nby not acknowledging their potency,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwe are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nWe are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo we need to see through the pathology\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand into the range of human capability.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd, most importantly, there's a partnership\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbetween those perceived deficiencies\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand our greatest creative ability.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSo it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nas something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nbut instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nSo maybe the idea I want to put out there is\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nnot so much overcoming adversity\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nas it is opening ourselves up to it,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nembracing it,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\ngrappling with it,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nto use a wrestling term,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nmaybe even dancing with it.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwe're less burdened by the presence of it.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nThis year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nand it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nthat Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nTo paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nnor is it the most intelligent that survives;\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nit is the one that is most adaptable to change.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nConflict is the genesis of creation.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nFrom Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nthe human ability to survive and flourish\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nis driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\ninto transformation.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nSo, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nMaybe that's what adversity gives us:\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\na sense of self, a sense of our own power.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo, we can give ourselves a gift.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nWe can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nMaybe we can see it as change.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAdversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nI think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nis this idea of normalcy.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nNow, who's normal?\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThere's no normal.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nThere's common, there's typical. There's no normal,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI don't think so.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nIf we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nto one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwe can release the power of so many more children,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnthropologists tell us that the one thing\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nwe as humans have always required of our community members\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nis to be of use, to be able to contribute.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThere's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:16.958\ncarried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nand perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nproved of value to the community.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nThey didn't view these people as broken and useless;\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nthey were seen as rare and valuable.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nA few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nin that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nIt was summertime: I had shorts on.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nI hear this guy, his voice behind me say, \"Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins.\"\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nAnd I said, \"I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you.\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nHe said, \"Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nI mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.\"\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nOh, that guy.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nAnd, but of course, actually, it did click.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nThis man was Dr. Kean,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\na man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nbecause, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nso the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd, because I was born without the fibula bones,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nand had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nhe had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nHe said to me, \"I had to give this prognosis to your parents\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nthat you would never walk,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nor any kind of life of independence,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand you've been making liar out of me ever since.\"\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nThe extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nnewspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nwhether winning a second grade spelling bee,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nmarching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nwinning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nmed students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nAnd he called this part of the course the X Factor,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nthe potential of the human will.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nNo prognosis can account for how powerful this could be\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nas a determinant in the quality of someone's life.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nAnd Dr. Kean went on to tell me,\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nhe said, \"In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand even if given a modicum of support,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nif left to their own devices, a child will achieve.\"\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSee, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nHe understood that there's a difference between the medical condition\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand what someone might do with it.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nAnd there's been a shift in my thinking over time,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nin that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nif I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nI wouldn't have hesitated for a second.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nI aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nBut if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd it's because of the experiences I've had with them,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nnot in spite of the experiences I've had with them.\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nAnd perhaps this shift in me has happened\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nbecause I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nthan those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nSee, all you really need is one person\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nto show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nIf you can hand somebody the key to their own power --\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nthe human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nand open a door for someone at a crucial moment,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nyou are educating them in the best sense.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nYou're teaching them to open doors for themselves.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nIn fact, the exact meaning of the word \"educate\"\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:40.958\ncomes from the root word \"educe.\"\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nIt means \"to bring forth what is within,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nto bring out potential.\"\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nSo again, which potential do we want to bring out?\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nThere was a case study done in 1960s Britain,\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nwhen they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nIt's called the streaming trials. We call it \"tracking\" here in the States.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nIt's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nAnd the \"A students\" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nWell, they took, over a three-month period,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nD-level students, gave them A's,\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\ntold them they were \"A's,\" told them they were bright,\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nand at the end of this three-month period,\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nthey were performing at A-level.\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nAnd, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nis that they took the \"A students\" and told them they were \"D's.\"\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nAnd that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nThose who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nA crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nThe teachers didn't know a switch had been made.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nThey were simply told, \"These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'\"\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nAnd that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nSo, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:17.958\na spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\nit doesn't see beauty,\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nit no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nand our innate ability to imagine.\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nIf instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nto see beauty in themselves and others,\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nto be curious and imaginative,\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nthen we are truly using our power well.\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nWhen a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nand new ways of being.\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nI'd like to leave you with a poem\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nby a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\nthat my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,\n\n00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nand the poem is called \"The God Who Only Knows Four Words\":\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:11.958\n\"Every child has known God,\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nnot the God of names,\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nnot the God of don'ts,\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nbut the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nsaying, 'Come dance with me.\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nCome, dance with me.

And that might seem a bit surprising, because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people; in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: there will be too much rain, not enough rain; things will change in ways their fragile environment simply can't support. And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.Also, the price of energy is very important to them. In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. Now, the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s, we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning; we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But as we make it cheaper \u2014 and let's say, let's go for making it twice as cheap \u2014 we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2.CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses.Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be, and where the positive feedbacks are \u2014 there's some uncertainty there, but not very much. And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? And the answer is, until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. And so that's a big challenge. It's very different than saying, \"We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under.\" This is something that has to get to zero.Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year \u2014 over 26 billion tons. For each American, it's about 20 tons. For people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It's been constantly going up. It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero.This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication. So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person is using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. So let's look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.(Laughter)That's back from high school algebra. But let's take a look.First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. These are very good things. Getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it's a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, overall, that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street lamps.Now, efficiency, \"E,\" the energy for each service \u2014 here, finally we have some good news. We have something that's not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings \u2014 there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. There are other services, like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. And so overall, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it.So let's look at this fourth factor \u2014 this is going to be a key one \u2014 and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy. So the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? If you burn coal, no. If you burn natural gas, no. Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. So we need energy miracles.Now, when I use the term \"miracle,\" I don't mean something that's impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually, we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.Now, I thought, \"How could I really capture this? Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?\" I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes, and somehow people enjoyed that.(Laughter)It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitoes. With energy, all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.(Laughter)Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. We need solutions, either one or several, that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability. And although there's many directions that people are seeking, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better. But my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges.Let's look first at burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there seems like it might be simple, but it's not. And that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. Now, we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level. But getting up to that full percentage \u2014 that will be very tricky. And agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue: Who's going to be sure? Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? This is a lot of volume. So that's a tough one.Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems: cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste? Although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on.The last three of the five, I've grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually \u2014 although it's great they don't require fuel \u2014 they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also, these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. So we've got big cost challenges here. We have transmission challenges; for example, say this energy source is outside your country, you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.And, finally, this storage problem. To dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteries made \u2014 for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything \u2014 and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses. What I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using. If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery.Now, how are we going to go forward on this \u2014 what's the right approach? Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? Well, we need lots of companies working on this \u2014 hundreds. In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. A lot of them, you'll look at and say, \"They're crazy.\" That's good. And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. Innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium \u2014 the one percent, which is the U235 \u2014 we decided, \"Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238.\" It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right materials approach, this looks like it would work.And because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. So instead of worrying about them, you just take that, it's a great thing. It breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. You see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium. That would power the US for hundreds of years. And simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? What should our report card look like? Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. That really is very important, that we get there. And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries \u2014 still some agriculture; hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. The other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and are in the process of getting it elsewhere? That's super important. That's a key element of making that report card.Backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? Well, again, it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2, and therefore, the less the temperature. But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book, \"Our Choice,\" and the David MacKay book, \"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.\" They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. There's a lot that has to come together.So this is a wish. It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years \u2014 I could pick who's president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented \u2014 this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the US and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all, the lives of those two billion will be far worse.So what do we have to do? What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. They should discuss this innovation agenda. You'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives \u2014 CO2 tax, cap and trade \u2014 something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.Thank you.(Applause) (Applause ends)Thank you.Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.(Applause)CA: Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower. I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?Bill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, which we've done, that's only tens of millions. And even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor \u2014 finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it.CA: So to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground, almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong, where you're opening it up and moving things in and out \u2014 that's not good. So if you have very \u2014(Laughter)very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in \u2014 just think of it as a log \u2014 put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there \u2014 there's a lot less waste under this approach \u2014 then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that. And we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors \u2014 that's our fuel to begin with. So the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process.CA: You're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called \"nuclear.\" So we've got a lot of interest. People from the company have been in Russia, India, China. I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I'm optimistic. The French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live?BG: Well, we need \u2014 for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. And TerraPower \u2014 if things go well, which is wishing for a lot \u2014 could easily meet that. And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies \u2014 we need it to be hundreds \u2014 who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this. And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed.CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changers, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that's a different approach. There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal. And so, if you can deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation, the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own.CA: If this doesn't work, then what? Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been overeating, and you're about to have a heart attack. Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. Now, that's just an insurance policy; you hope you don't need to do that. Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geoengineering discussion about: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong?BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here \u2014 it's kind of like with AIDS: you make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing. In fact, the IPCC report \u2014 that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say, \"OK, that isn't that big of a deal.\" The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, \"OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2. But I guess I'll accept it, because it's cheaper than what's come before.\"(Applause)CA: So that would be your response to the Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg argument, basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do.BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece \u2014 say the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now \u2014 it's not that dramatic. It shouldn't take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that \u2014 that, to me, mostly is a waste. Unless you're very close, and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. If the trade-off you get into is, \"Let's make energy super expensive,\" then the rich can afford that. I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion.And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is, \"Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?\" He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the R&D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R&D piece \u2014 it's crazy how little it's funded.CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 767, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:16.346\nI'm going to talk today\nabout energy and climate.\n\n00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:18.839\nAnd that might seem a bit surprising,\n\n00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:22.012\nbecause my full-time work\nat the foundation\n\n00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:24.071\nis mostly about vaccines and seeds,\n\n00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.663\nabout the things that we need\nto invent and deliver\n\n00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:31.194\nto help the poorest two billion\nlive better lives.\n\n00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.934\nBut energy and climate\nare extremely important to these people;\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:41.229\nin fact, more important\nthan to anyone else on the planet.\n\n00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:47.462\nThe climate getting worse means\nthat many years, their crops won't grow:\n\n00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.517\nthere will be too much rain,\nnot enough rain;\n\n00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:56.478\nthings will change in ways their fragile\nenvironment simply can't support.\n\n00:00:56.502 --> 00:01:00.131\nAnd that leads to starvation, it leads\nto uncertainty, it leads to unrest.\n\n00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.964\nSo, the climate changes\nwill be terrible for them.\n\n00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:07.934\nAlso, the price of energy\nis very important to them.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.236\nIn fact, if you could pick just one thing\n\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.992\nto lower the price of to reduce poverty,\nby far you would pick energy.\n\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.573\nNow, the price of energy\nhas come down over time.\n\n00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:25.347\nReally advanced civilization\nis based on advances in energy.\n\n00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:29.307\nThe coal revolution fueled\nthe Industrial Revolution,\n\n00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:33.392\nand, even in the 1900s,\nwe've seen a very rapid decline\n\n00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.934\nin the price of electricity,\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.340\nand that's why we have\nrefrigerators, air-conditioning;\n\n00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.676\nwe can make modern materials\nand do so many things.\n\n00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:48.337\nAnd so, we're in a wonderful situation\nwith electricity in the rich world.\n\n00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:52.121\nBut as we make it cheaper --\nand let's say,\n\n00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.854\nlet's go for making it twice as cheap --\n\n00:01:56.314 --> 00:01:57.934\nwe need to meet a new constraint,\n\n00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:02.677\nand that constraint has to do with CO2.\n\n00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:05.770\nCO2 is warming the planet,\n\n00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:10.934\nand the equation on CO2\nis actually a very straightforward one.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.897\nIf you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,\n\n00:02:15.564 --> 00:02:17.934\nthat leads to a temperature increase,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.934\nand that temperature increase\nleads to some very negative effects:\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.871\nthe effects on the weather;\nperhaps worse, the indirect effects,\n\n00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:30.588\nin that the natural ecosystems\ncan't adjust to these rapid changes,\n\n00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:32.855\nand so you get ecosystem collapses.\n\n00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:38.753\nNow, the exact amount of how you map\nfrom a certain increase of CO2\n\n00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:42.067\nto what temperature will be,\nand where the positive feedbacks are --\n\n00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.811\nthere's some uncertainty there,\nbut not very much.\n\n00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:48.524\nAnd there's certainly uncertainty\nabout how bad those effects will be,\n\n00:02:48.548 --> 00:02:50.284\nbut they will be extremely bad.\n\n00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.461\nI asked the top scientists\non this several times:\n\n00:02:53.485 --> 00:02:56.009\nDo we really have to get\ndown to near zero?\n\n00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:59.066\nCan't we just cut it in half or a quarter?\n\n00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.934\nAnd the answer is,\nuntil we get near to zero,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.934\nthe temperature will continue to rise.\n\n00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:07.186\nAnd so that's a big challenge.\n\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.436\nIt's very different than saying,\n\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.796\n\"We're a twelve-foot-high truck\ntrying to get under a ten-foot bridge,\n\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.203\nand we can just sort of squeeze under.\"\n\n00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:18.550\nThis is something that has to get to zero.\n\n00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:22.795\nNow, we put out a lot\nof carbon dioxide every year --\n\n00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.922\nover 26 billion tons.\n\n00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.704\nFor each American, it's about 20 tons.\n\n00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:31.934\nFor people in poor countries,\nit's less than one ton.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.618\nIt's an average of about five tons\nfor everyone on the planet.\n\n00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.933\nAnd somehow, we have to make changes\nthat will bring that down to zero.\n\n00:03:41.575 --> 00:03:43.719\nIt's been constantly going up.\n\n00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:48.348\nIt's only various economic changes\nthat have even flattened it at all,\n\n00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:51.829\nso we have to go\nfrom rapidly rising to falling,\n\n00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:53.935\nand falling all the way to zero.\n\n00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.934\nThis equation has four factors,\na little bit of multiplication.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.722\nSo you've got a thing on the left,\nCO2, that you want to get to zero,\n\n00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:05.136\nand that's going to be based\non the number of people,\n\n00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.550\nthe services each person\nis using on average,\n\n00:04:08.574 --> 00:04:11.443\nthe energy, on average, for each service,\n\n00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:15.299\nand the CO2 being put out\nper unit of energy.\n\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.643\nSo let's look at each one of these,\n\n00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.537\nand see how we can get this down to zero.\n\n00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:24.748\nProbably, one of these numbers is going\nto have to get pretty near to zero.\n\n00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:25.954\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:27.952\nThat's back from high school algebra.\n\n00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.296\nBut let's take a look.\n\n00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:31.508\nFirst, we've got population.\n\n00:04:32.152 --> 00:04:34.934\nThe world today has 6.8 billion people.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.161\nThat's headed up to about nine billion.\n\n00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:41.246\nNow, if we do a really great job\non new vaccines,\n\n00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.727\nhealth care, reproductive health services,\n\n00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:46.852\nwe could lower that by,\nperhaps, 10 or 15 percent.\n\n00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:50.667\nBut there, we see\nan increase of about 1.3.\n\n00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:53.976\nThe second factor is the services we use.\n\n00:04:54.413 --> 00:04:56.178\nThis encompasses everything:\n\n00:04:56.202 --> 00:05:00.375\nthe food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.\n\n00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.372\nThese are very good things.\n\n00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:06.594\nGetting rid of poverty means\nproviding these services\n\n00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:08.623\nto almost everyone on the planet.\n\n00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:11.934\nAnd it's a great thing\nfor this number to go up.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.197\nIn the rich world, perhaps\nthe top one billion,\n\n00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:16.606\nwe probably could cut back and use less,\n\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.746\nbut every year, this number,\non average, is going to go up,\n\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.934\nand so, overall,\nthat will more than double\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.397\nthe services delivered per person.\n\n00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:29.199\nHere we have a very basic service:\n\n00:05:29.223 --> 00:05:32.635\nDo you have lighting in your house\nto be able to read your homework?\n\n00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.178\nAnd, in fact, these kids don't,\n\n00:05:34.202 --> 00:05:36.520\nso they're going out and reading\ntheir schoolwork\n\n00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.938\nunder the street lamps.\n\n00:05:39.236 --> 00:05:42.934\nNow, efficiency, \"E,\"\nthe energy for each service --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.935\nhere, finally we have some good news.\n\n00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.821\nWe have something that's not going up.\n\n00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:49.934\nThrough various inventions\nand new ways of doing lighting,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:55.389\nthrough different types of cars,\ndifferent ways of building buildings --\n\n00:05:55.413 --> 00:05:57.048\nthere are a lot of services\n\n00:05:57.072 --> 00:06:00.412\nwhere you can bring the energy\nfor that service down\n\n00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:01.934\nquite substantially.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.453\nSome individual services\neven bring it down by 90 percent.\n\n00:06:05.477 --> 00:06:08.823\nThere are other services,\nlike how we make fertilizer,\n\n00:06:08.847 --> 00:06:10.489\nor how we do air transport,\n\n00:06:10.513 --> 00:06:13.430\nwhere the rooms for improvement\nare far, far less.\n\n00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:18.152\nAnd so overall, if we're optimistic,\nwe may get a reduction\n\n00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:23.045\nof a factor of three to even,\nperhaps, a factor of six.\n\n00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:25.934\nBut for these first three factors now,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:31.018\nwe've gone from 26 billion\nto, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,\n\n00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:32.503\nand that just won't cut it.\n\n00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:36.755\nSo let's look at this fourth factor --\nthis is going to be a key one --\n\n00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:42.668\nand this is the amount of CO2\nput out per each unit of energy.\n\n00:06:43.132 --> 00:06:46.657\nSo the question is:\nCan you actually get that to zero?\n\n00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:49.587\nIf you burn coal, no.\n\n00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.086\nIf you burn natural gas, no.\n\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.213\nAlmost every way\nwe make electricity today,\n\n00:06:54.237 --> 00:06:59.789\nexcept for the emerging renewables\nand nuclear, puts out CO2.\n\n00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:03.502\nAnd so, what we're going to have\nto do at a global scale,\n\n00:07:03.526 --> 00:07:05.381\nis create a new system.\n\n00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:07.696\nSo we need energy miracles.\n\n00:07:08.484 --> 00:07:12.777\nNow, when I use the term \"miracle,\"\nI don't mean something that's impossible.\n\n00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.221\nThe microprocessor is a miracle.\n\n00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:17.230\nThe personal computer is a miracle.\n\n00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:19.721\nThe Internet and its services\nare a miracle.\n\n00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:24.360\nSo the people here have participated\nin the creation of many miracles.\n\n00:07:24.815 --> 00:07:26.792\nUsually, we don't have a deadline\n\n00:07:26.816 --> 00:07:29.294\nwhere you have to get the miracle\nby a certain date.\n\n00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:33.299\nUsually, you just kind of stand by,\nand some come along, some don't.\n\n00:07:33.323 --> 00:07:37.422\nThis is a case where we actually\nhave to drive at full speed\n\n00:07:37.446 --> 00:07:41.437\nand get a miracle\nin a pretty tight timeline.\n\n00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:45.392\nNow, I thought, \"How could\nI really capture this?\n\n00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:47.639\nIs there some kind\nof natural illustration,\n\n00:07:47.663 --> 00:07:51.533\nsome demonstration that would grab\npeople's imagination here?\"\n\n00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.934\nI thought back to a year ago\nwhen I brought mosquitoes,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.588\nand somehow people enjoyed that.\n\n00:07:58.612 --> 00:08:00.219\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:00.243 --> 00:08:04.289\nIt really got them involved\nin the idea of, you know,\n\n00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:06.365\nthere are people who live with mosquitoes.\n\n00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:10.003\nWith energy, all I could\ncome up with is this.\n\n00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:13.933\nI decided that releasing fireflies\n\n00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:17.590\nwould be my contribution\nto the environment here this year.\n\n00:08:18.074 --> 00:08:20.934\nSo here we have some natural fireflies.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.567\nI'm told they don't bite; in fact,\nthey might not even leave that jar.\n\n00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.163\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:31.929\nNow, there's all sorts of gimmicky\nsolutions like that one,\n\n00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:33.854\nbut they don't really add up to much.\n\n00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:37.901\nWe need solutions, either one or several,\n\n00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:43.436\nthat have unbelievable scale\nand unbelievable reliability.\n\n00:08:43.966 --> 00:08:47.434\nAnd although there's many directions\nthat people are seeking,\n\n00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:51.079\nI really only see five\nthat can achieve the big numbers.\n\n00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:55.846\nI've left out tide,\ngeothermal, fusion, biofuels.\n\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.847\nThose may make some contribution,\n\n00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.720\nand if they can do better\nthan I expect, so much the better.\n\n00:09:00.744 --> 00:09:04.666\nBut my key point here\nis that we're going to have to work on\n\n00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.416\neach of these five,\n\n00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.237\nand we can't give up any of them\nbecause they look daunting,\n\n00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.122\nbecause they all have\nsignificant challenges.\n\n00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.379\nLet's look first at burning fossil fuels,\n\n00:09:16.403 --> 00:09:19.244\neither burning coal\nor burning natural gas.\n\n00:09:19.719 --> 00:09:23.805\nWhat you need to do there seems\nlike it might be simple, but it's not.\n\n00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:26.262\nAnd that's to take all the CO2,\n\n00:09:26.286 --> 00:09:28.934\nafter you've burned it,\ngoing out the flue,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.103\npressurize it, create a liquid,\nput it somewhere,\n\n00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:33.557\nand hope it stays there.\n\n00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.772\nNow, we have some pilot things\n\n00:09:35.796 --> 00:09:38.135\nthat do this at the 60 to 80\npercent level.\n\n00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:42.558\nBut getting up to that full percentage --\nthat will be very tricky.\n\n00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:48.154\nAnd agreeing on where these CO2\nquantities should be put will be hard,\n\n00:09:48.178 --> 00:09:50.840\nbut the toughest one here\nis this long-term issue:\n\n00:09:50.864 --> 00:09:52.404\nWho's going to be sure?\n\n00:09:52.428 --> 00:09:54.026\nWho's going to guarantee\n\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.119\nsomething that is literally\nbillions of times larger\n\n00:09:57.143 --> 00:10:01.289\nthan any type of waste you think of\nin terms of nuclear or other things?\n\n00:10:01.313 --> 00:10:03.793\nThis is a lot of volume.\n\n00:10:04.392 --> 00:10:05.598\nSo that's a tough one.\n\n00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:07.560\nNext would be nuclear.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.934\nIt also has three big problems:\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.934\ncost, particularly in highly\nregulated countries, is high;\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:19.612\nthe issue of safety, really feeling good\nabout nothing could go wrong,\n\n00:10:19.636 --> 00:10:22.640\nthat, even though you have\nthese human operators,\n\n00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.013\nthe fuel doesn't get used for weapons.\n\n00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:27.369\nAnd then what do you do with the waste?\n\n00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:30.797\nAlthough it's not very large,\nthere are a lot of concerns about that.\n\n00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:32.486\nPeople need to feel good about it.\n\n00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.934\nSo three very tough problems\nthat might be solvable,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.541\nand so, should be worked on.\n\n00:10:39.147 --> 00:10:41.838\nThe last three of the five,\nI've grouped together.\n\n00:10:41.862 --> 00:10:45.277\nThese are what people often refer to\nas the renewable sources.\n\n00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:49.822\nAnd they actually -- although it's great\nthey don't require fuel --\n\n00:10:49.846 --> 00:10:51.822\nthey have some disadvantages.\n\n00:10:52.275 --> 00:10:58.117\nOne is that the density of energy\ngathered in these technologies\n\n00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.204\nis dramatically less than a power plant.\n\n00:11:00.228 --> 00:11:01.910\nThis is energy farming,\n\n00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:06.055\nso you're talking about many square miles,\nthousands of times more area\n\n00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:08.583\nthan you think of\nas a normal energy plant.\n\n00:11:09.456 --> 00:11:12.044\nAlso, these are intermittent sources.\n\n00:11:12.068 --> 00:11:15.483\nThe sun doesn't shine all day,\nit doesn't shine every day,\n\n00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:17.934\nand likewise, the wind\ndoesn't blow all the time.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.347\nAnd so, if you depend on these sources,\n\n00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:22.721\nyou have to have some way\nof getting the energy\n\n00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:25.720\nduring those time periods\nthat it's not available.\n\n00:11:26.116 --> 00:11:28.741\nSo we've got big cost challenges here.\n\n00:11:29.196 --> 00:11:31.094\nWe have transmission challenges;\n\n00:11:31.118 --> 00:11:34.682\nfor example, say this energy source\nis outside your country,\n\n00:11:34.706 --> 00:11:36.799\nyou not only need the technology,\n\n00:11:36.823 --> 00:11:41.196\nbut you have to deal with the risk\nof the energy coming from elsewhere.\n\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.129\nAnd, finally, this storage problem.\n\n00:11:43.758 --> 00:11:45.259\nTo dimensionalize this,\n\n00:11:45.283 --> 00:11:48.836\nI went through and looked\nat all the types of batteries made --\n\n00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.372\nfor cars, for computers, for phones,\nfor flashlights, for everything --\n\n00:11:53.396 --> 00:11:57.890\nand compared that to the amount\nof electrical energy the world uses.\n\n00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:01.935\nWhat I found is that all\nthe batteries we make now\n\n00:12:01.959 --> 00:12:05.186\ncould store less than 10 minutes\nof all the energy.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.326\nAnd so, in fact, we need\na big breakthrough here,\n\n00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.218\nsomething that's going to be\na factor of 100 better\n\n00:12:13.242 --> 00:12:15.075\nthan the approaches we have now.\n\n00:12:15.099 --> 00:12:18.864\nIt's not impossible,\nbut it's not a very easy thing.\n\n00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:22.934\nNow, this shows up when you try\nto get the intermittent source\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.110\nto be above, say, 20 to 30 percent\nof what you're using.\n\n00:12:27.134 --> 00:12:29.728\nIf you're counting on it for 100 percent,\n\n00:12:29.752 --> 00:12:33.411\nyou need an incredible miracle battery.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.575\nNow, how are we going to go forward\non this -- what's the right approach?\n\n00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:42.178\nIs it a Manhattan Project?\nWhat's the thing that can get us there?\n\n00:12:42.202 --> 00:12:47.013\nWell, we need lots of companies\nworking on this -- hundreds.\n\n00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:50.616\nIn each of these five paths,\nwe need at least a hundred people.\n\n00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.350\nA lot of them, you'll look at\nand say, \"They're crazy.\"\n\n00:12:53.374 --> 00:12:54.555\nThat's good.\n\n00:12:54.579 --> 00:12:57.509\nAnd, I think, here in the TED group,\n\n00:12:57.533 --> 00:13:00.744\nwe have many people\nwho are already pursuing this.\n\n00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:04.934\nBill Gross has several companies,\nincluding one called eSolar\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.740\nthat has some great\nsolar thermal technologies.\n\n00:13:07.764 --> 00:13:11.214\nVinod Khosla is investing\nin dozens of companies\n\n00:13:11.238 --> 00:13:15.165\nthat are doing great things\nand have interesting possibilities,\n\n00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:17.338\nand I'm trying to help back that.\n\n00:13:17.362 --> 00:13:20.934\nNathan Myhrvold and I\nactually are backing a company\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.730\nthat, perhaps surprisingly,\nis actually taking the nuclear approach.\n\n00:13:24.754 --> 00:13:28.692\nThere are some innovations\nin nuclear: modular, liquid.\n\n00:13:29.356 --> 00:13:33.129\nInnovation really stopped\nin this industry quite some ago,\n\n00:13:33.153 --> 00:13:36.248\nso the idea that there's some\ngood ideas laying around\n\n00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:37.997\nis not all that surprising.\n\n00:13:38.487 --> 00:13:44.277\nThe idea of TerraPower is that,\ninstead of burning a part of uranium --\n\n00:13:44.301 --> 00:13:47.420\nthe one percent, which is the U235 --\n\n00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:51.160\nwe decided, \"Let's burn\nthe 99 percent, the U238.\"\n\n00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:54.049\nIt is kind of a crazy idea.\n\n00:13:54.073 --> 00:13:57.216\nIn fact, people had talked\nabout it for a long time,\n\n00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.401\nbut they could never simulate properly\nwhether it would work or not,\n\n00:14:01.425 --> 00:14:04.290\nand so it's through the advent\nof modern supercomputers\n\n00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:06.445\nthat now you can simulate\nand see that, yes,\n\n00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:11.677\nwith the right materials approach,\nthis looks like it would work.\n\n00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.934\nAnd because you're burning\nthat 99 percent,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:19.341\nyou have greatly improved cost profile.\n\n00:14:19.365 --> 00:14:23.575\nYou actually burn up the waste,\nand you can actually use as fuel\n\n00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:26.624\nall the leftover waste\nfrom today's reactors.\n\n00:14:26.648 --> 00:14:30.439\nSo instead of worrying about them,\nyou just take that, it's a great thing.\n\n00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:35.281\nIt breeds this uranium as it goes along,\nso it's kind of like a candle.\n\n00:14:35.305 --> 00:14:39.037\nYou see it's a log there, often\nreferred to as a traveling wave reactor.\n\n00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:43.377\nIn terms of fuel,\nthis really solves the problem.\n\n00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:46.302\nI've got a picture here\nof a place in Kentucky.\n\n00:14:46.326 --> 00:14:48.526\nThis is the leftover, the 99 percent,\n\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.780\nwhere they've taken out\nthe part they burn now,\n\n00:14:50.804 --> 00:14:52.374\nso it's called depleted uranium.\n\n00:14:52.398 --> 00:14:55.245\nThat would power the US\nfor hundreds of years.\n\n00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.804\nAnd simply by filtering seawater\nin an inexpensive process,\n\n00:14:58.828 --> 00:15:02.637\nyou'd have enough fuel for the entire\nlifetime of the rest of the planet.\n\n00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:07.073\nSo, you know, it's got lots\nof challenges ahead,\n\n00:15:07.097 --> 00:15:12.492\nbut it is an example of the many\nhundreds and hundreds of ideas\n\n00:15:12.516 --> 00:15:14.375\nthat we need to move forward.\n\n00:15:15.365 --> 00:15:18.063\nSo let's think: How should\nwe measure ourselves?\n\n00:15:18.087 --> 00:15:20.934\nWhat should our report card look like?\n\n00:15:21.314 --> 00:15:23.838\nWell, let's go out to where\nwe really need to get,\n\n00:15:23.862 --> 00:15:26.005\nand then look at the intermediate.\n\n00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:31.051\nFor 2050, you've heard many people\ntalk about this 80 percent reduction.\n\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.852\nThat really is very important,\nthat we get there.\n\n00:15:34.876 --> 00:15:39.297\nAnd that 20 percent will be used up\nby things going on in poor countries --\n\n00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:44.715\nstill some agriculture; hopefully,\nwe will have cleaned up forestry, cement.\n\n00:15:44.739 --> 00:15:47.728\nSo, to get to that 80 percent,\n\n00:15:47.752 --> 00:15:52.257\nthe developed countries,\nincluding countries like China,\n\n00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:56.680\nwill have had to switch\ntheir electricity generation altogether.\n\n00:15:57.083 --> 00:16:02.934\nThe other grade is: Are we deploying\nthis zero-emission technology,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.355\nhave we deployed it\nin all the developed countries\n\n00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:08.166\nand are in the process\nof getting it elsewhere?\n\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.934\nThat's super important.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.297\nThat's a key element\nof making that report card.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:18.263\nBacking up from there, what should\nthe 2020 report card look like?\n\n00:16:18.713 --> 00:16:21.031\nWell, again, it should have\nthe two elements.\n\n00:16:21.055 --> 00:16:25.194\nWe should go through these efficiency\nmeasures to start getting reductions:\n\n00:16:25.218 --> 00:16:28.482\nThe less we emit,\nthe less that sum will be of CO2,\n\n00:16:28.506 --> 00:16:30.578\nand therefore, the less the temperature.\n\n00:16:30.602 --> 00:16:33.531\nBut in some ways, the grade we get there,\n\n00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:37.799\ndoing things that don't get us\nall the way to the big reductions,\n\n00:16:37.823 --> 00:16:41.667\nis only equally, or maybe even slightly\nless, important than the other,\n\n00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:45.447\nwhich is the piece of innovation\non these breakthroughs.\n\n00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:48.709\nThese breakthroughs,\nwe need to move those at full speed,\n\n00:16:48.733 --> 00:16:51.158\nand we can measure that\nin terms of companies,\n\n00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:54.076\npilot projects, regulatory things\nthat have been changed.\n\n00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.530\nThere's a lot of great books\nthat have been written about this.\n\n00:16:57.554 --> 00:16:59.934\nThe Al Gore book, \"Our Choice,\"\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.538\nand the David MacKay book,\n\"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.\"\n\n00:17:03.562 --> 00:17:06.738\nThey really go through it\nand create a framework\n\n00:17:06.762 --> 00:17:08.595\nthat this can be discussed broadly,\n\n00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.576\nbecause we need broad backing for this.\n\n00:17:10.944 --> 00:17:13.171\nThere's a lot that has to come together.\n\n00:17:13.195 --> 00:17:14.677\nSo this is a wish.\n\n00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.878\nIt's a very concrete wish\nthat we invent this technology.\n\n00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.419\nIf you gave me only one wish\nfor the next 50 years --\n\n00:17:22.443 --> 00:17:24.420\nI could pick who's president,\n\n00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:27.206\nI could pick a vaccine,\nwhich is something I love,\n\n00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.287\nor I could pick that this thing\n\n00:17:29.311 --> 00:17:32.772\nthat's half the cost with no CO2\ngets invented --\n\n00:17:32.796 --> 00:17:34.703\nthis is the wish I would pick.\n\n00:17:34.727 --> 00:17:36.812\nThis is the one with the greatest impact.\n\n00:17:36.836 --> 00:17:38.481\nIf we don't get this wish,\n\n00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:41.943\nthe division between the people\nwho think short term and long term\n\n00:17:41.967 --> 00:17:43.125\nwill be terrible,\n\n00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:46.093\nbetween the US and China,\nbetween poor countries and rich,\n\n00:17:46.117 --> 00:17:47.311\nand most of all,\n\n00:17:47.335 --> 00:17:50.399\nthe lives of those two billion\nwill be far worse.\n\n00:17:51.116 --> 00:17:52.934\nSo what do we have to do?\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:57.782\nWhat am I appealing to you\nto step forward and drive?\n\n00:17:58.147 --> 00:18:00.728\nWe need to go for more research funding.\n\n00:18:01.148 --> 00:18:03.773\nWhen countries get together\nin places like Copenhagen,\n\n00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:06.216\nthey shouldn't just discuss the CO2.\n\n00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.607\nThey should discuss\nthis innovation agenda.\n\n00:18:08.631 --> 00:18:12.934\nYou'd be stunned at the ridiculously\nlow levels of spending\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.673\non these innovative approaches.\n\n00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:18.934\nWe do need the market incentives --\nCO2 tax, cap and trade --\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.482\nsomething that gets\nthat price signal out there.\n\n00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:23.437\nWe need to get the message out.\n\n00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:25.865\nWe need to have this dialogue\nbe a more rational,\n\n00:18:25.889 --> 00:18:27.479\nmore understandable dialogue,\n\n00:18:27.503 --> 00:18:30.034\nincluding the steps\nthat the government takes.\n\n00:18:30.058 --> 00:18:33.708\nThis is an important wish,\nbut it is one I think we can achieve.\n\n00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:35.527\nThank you.\n\n00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:42.551\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:44.933 --> 00:18:46.934\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:48.174\nThank you.\n\n00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:51.106\nChris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.\n\n00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:56.191\n(Applause)\n\n00:18:56.215 --> 00:18:57.713\nCA: Thank you.\n\n00:18:57.737 --> 00:19:01.799\nSo to understand more about TerraPower.\n\n00:19:02.357 --> 00:19:06.351\nI mean, first of all, can you give a sense\nof what scale of investment this is?\n\n00:19:06.856 --> 00:19:11.190\nBill Gates: To actually do the software,\nbuy the supercomputer,\n\n00:19:11.214 --> 00:19:13.543\nhire all the great scientists,\nwhich we've done,\n\n00:19:13.567 --> 00:19:15.824\nthat's only tens of millions.\n\n00:19:15.848 --> 00:19:19.796\nAnd even once we test our materials out\nin a Russian reactor\n\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.995\nto make sure our materials work properly,\n\n00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:25.536\nthen you'll only be up\nin the hundreds of millions.\n\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.918\nThe tough thing\nis building the pilot reactor --\n\n00:19:27.942 --> 00:19:32.746\nfinding the several billion,\nfinding the regulator, the location\n\n00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.029\nthat will actually build\nthe first one of these.\n\n00:19:35.053 --> 00:19:39.215\nOnce you get the first one built,\nif it works as advertised,\n\n00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:40.589\nthen it's just clear as day,\n\n00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:43.809\nbecause the economics,\nthe energy density, are so different\n\n00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:45.247\nthan nuclear as we know it.\n\n00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:46.733\nCA: So to understand it right,\n\n00:19:46.757 --> 00:19:49.039\nthis involves building\ndeep into the ground,\n\n00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:54.623\nalmost like a vertical column\nof nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,\n\n00:19:54.647 --> 00:19:57.787\nand then the process starts\nat the top and kind of

people and lots\nof controls that can go wrong,\n\n00:20:04.311 --> 00:20:07.050\nwhere you're opening it up\nand moving things in and out --\n\n00:20:07.074 --> 00:20:09.231\nthat's not good.\n\n00:20:09.255 --> 00:20:10.428\nSo if you have very --\n\n00:20:10.452 --> 00:20:11.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:14.312\nvery cheap fuel\nthat you can put 60 years in --\n\n00:20:14.336 --> 00:20:15.890\njust think of it as a log --\n\n00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:19.452\nput it down and not have\nthose same complexities.\n\n00:20:19.476 --> 00:20:24.381\nAnd it just sits there and burns\nfor the 60 years, and then it's done.\n\n00:20:24.405 --> 00:20:28.343\nCA: It's a nuclear power plant\nthat is its own waste disposal solution.\n\n00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:30.261\nBG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,\n\n00:20:30.285 --> 00:20:35.665\nyou can let it sit there -- there's a lot\nless waste under this approach --\n\n00:20:35.689 --> 00:20:37.325\nthen you can actually take that\n\n00:20:37.349 --> 00:20:39.934\nand put it into another one and burn that.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:44.164\nAnd we start out, actually,\nby taking the waste that exists today\n\n00:20:44.188 --> 00:20:48.420\nthat's sitting in these cooling pools\nor dry-casking by reactors --\n\n00:20:48.444 --> 00:20:50.596\nthat's our fuel to begin with.\n\n00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.227\nSo the thing that's been a problem\nfrom those reactors\n\n00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:55.178\nis actually what gets fed into ours,\n\n00:20:55.202 --> 00:20:58.189\nand you're reducing the volume\nof the waste quite dramatically\n\n00:20:58.213 --> 00:21:00.190\nas you're going through this process.\n\n00:21:00.214 --> 00:21:02.789\nCA: You're talking\nto different people around the world\n\n00:21:02.813 --> 00:21:04.102\nabout the possibilities.\n\n00:21:04.126 --> 00:21:07.534\nWhere is there most interest\nin actually doing something

"https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_tells_technology_s_epic_story", "transcript": "I want to talk about my investigations into what technology means in our lives \u2014 not just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense, in the kind of long history of the world and our place in the world. What is this stuff? What is the significance? And so, I want to kind of go through my little story of what I found out.One of the first things I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology. In the United States, there is a State of the Union address given by every president since 1790. And each one of those is kind of summing up the most important things for the United States at that time. If you search for the word \"technology,\" it was not used until 1952. So, technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until 1952, which happened to be the year of my birth. And obviously, technology had existed before then, but we weren't aware of it. And so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life.I actually did research to find out the first use of the word \"technology.\" It was in 1829, and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum \u2014 a course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry \u2014 and he called it \"Technology.\" And that's the very first use of the word.So what is this stuff that we're all consumed by and bothered by? Alan Kay calls it, \"Technology is anything that was invented after you were born.\"(Laughter)Which is sort of the idea we normally have about what technology is: it's all that new stuff. It's not roads, or penicillin, or factory tires; it's the new stuff. My friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one, he says, \"Technology is anything that doesn't work yet.\"(Laughter)Which is, again, a sense that it's all new.But we know that it's just not new. It actually goes way back, and what I want to suggest is, it goes a long way back. So, another way to think about technology, what it means, is to imagine a world without technology. If we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today \u2014 and I mean everything, from blades to scrapers to cloth \u2014 we, as a species, would not live very long. We would die by the billions, and very quickly: the wolves would get us, we would be defenseless, we would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food.Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools. So, they had minimal technology, but they had some technology. And if we study those hunter-gatherer tribes and the Neanderthal, which are very similar to early man, we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology, and this is a kind of a curve of their average age.There are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than 40 years old that we've ever found, and the average age of most of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30. There are very few young infants, because they die \u2014 high mortality rate \u2014 and there's very few old people. So the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood: a lot of young people. And if you go there, you say, \"Hey, everybody's really healthy.\" Well, that's because they're all young.Same thing with the hunter-gatherer tribes and early man: you didn't live beyond the age of 30. So it was a world without grandparents. And grandparents are very important, because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information. Imagine a world where basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old. How much learning can you do? You can't do very much learning in your own life, it's so short, and there's nobody to pass on what you do learn. So that's one aspect.It was a very short life. But at the same time, anthropologists know that most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world, with that very little technology, actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food they needed: three to six hours a day. Some anthropologists call that the original affluent society, because they had bankers' hours, basically. So it was possible to get enough food. But when the scarcity came, when the highs and lows and the droughts came, then people went into starvation. And that's why they didn't live very long.So what technology brought, through the very simple tools like these stone tools here \u2014 even something as small as this \u2014 the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction about 250 megafauna animals in North America when they first arrived 10,000 years ago. So, long before the industrial age, we've been affecting the planet on a global scale with just a small amount of technology.The other thing that the early man invented was fire. And fire was used to clear out, and again, affected the ecology of grass and whole continents, and was used in cooking. It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things. It was, in a certain sense, in a McLuhan sense, an external stomach, in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise. And if we didn't have fire, we actually could not live. Our bodies have adapted to these new diets. Our bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years.So, with that little bit of technology, humans went from a small band of 10,000 or so \u2014 the same number as Neanderthals everywhere \u2014 and we suddenly exploded. With the invention of language around 50,000 years ago, the number of humans exploded, and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet. And they migrated into the rest of the world at two kilometers per year until, within several tens of thousands of years, we occupied every single watershed on the planet and became the most dominant species, with a very small amount of technology.And even at that time, with the introduction of agriculture, 8,000, 10,000 years ago, we started to see climate change. So climate change is not a new thing; what's new is just the degree of it. Even during the agricultural age, there was climate change. So already, small amounts of technology were transforming the world. And what this means, and where I'm going, is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world. All the things we see today that are changing our lives, we can always trace back to the introduction of some new technology.So it's a force, that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet, and in such a degree, that I think it's become who we are. In fact, our humanity and everything that we think about ourselves, is something we've invented. So we've invented ourselves. Of all the animals that we've domesticated, the most important animal has been us.So humanity is our greatest invention, but of course, we're not done yet. We're still inventing, and this is what technology is allowing us to do; it's continually to reinvent ourselves. It's a very, very strong force. I call this entire thing \u2014 us humans as our technology, everything that we've made, gadgets in our lives \u2014 we call that the technium. That's this world. My working definition of technology is: anything useful that a human mind makes. It's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops. But it's also law. And, of course, cities are ways to make things more useful to us. While this is something that comes from our mind, it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos.It goes back. The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang, in this way, in that they are part of this self-organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars, into life, into us. And the three major phases of the early universe was energy, when the dominant force was energy; then the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter; and then, with the invention of life four billion years ago, the dominant force in our neighborhood became information. That's what life is: an information process that was restructuring and making new order.So, energy and matter, Einstein showed were equivalent, and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information and matter and energy are all interrelated. So it's one long continuum. You put energy into the right kind of system, and out comes wasted heat, entropy, and extropy, which is order. It's the increased order.Where does this order come from? Its roots go way back. We actually don't know. But we do know that the self-organization trend throughout the universe is long, and it began with things like galaxies; they maintained their order for billions of years. Stars are basically nuclear fission machines that self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years: order against the extropy of the world. And flowers and plants are the same thing, extended, and technology is basically an extension of life.One trend that we notice in all those things is that the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through this is actually increasing. The amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence. And the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life is actually greater than a star \u2014 because of the star's long lifespan, the energy density in life is actually higher than a star. And the energy density that we see in the greatest amount anywhere in the universe is actually in a PC chip. There is more energy flowing through, per gram per second, than anything that we have any other experience with.And so, what I would suggest is that if you want to see where technology is going, we continue that trajectory, and we say, \"Well, it's going to become more energy-dense, that's where it's going.\" And so what I've done is, I've taken the same kinds of things and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say, \"What are the general trends in evolutionary life?\" And there are things moving towards greater complexity, moving towards greater diversity, moving towards greater specialization, sentience, ubiquity, and most important, evolvability. Those very same things are also present in technology. That's where technology is going.In fact, technology is accelerating all the aspects of life. And we can see that happening; just as there's diversity in life, there's more diversity in things we make. Things in life start off being general cells, and they become specialized: you have tissue cells, muscle, brain cells. The same thing happens with, say, a hammer, which is general at first and becomes more specific. So I would like to say that while there are six kingdoms of life, we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life. It's a branching off from the human form.But technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself. For instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself. In transportation, it's not to move us; it's to move the stuff we make or buy. I use the word \"want.\" Technology wants. This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power. Your cat wants more food. A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all, wants to move towards light. It has an urge, and technology has an urge.At the same time, it wants to give us things, and what it gives us is basically progress. You can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up. There's really no dispute about progress, if we discount the cost of that. And that's the thing that bothers most people, is that progress is really real, but we wonder and question: What are the environmental costs of it?I did a survey of the number of species of artifacts in my house, and there's 6,000. Other people have come up with 10,000. When King Henry of England died, he had 18,000 things in his house, but that was the entire wealth of England, so ...(Laughter)And with that entire wealth of England, King Henry could not buy any antibiotics, he could not buy refrigeration, he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles, whereas this rickshaw wallah in India could save up and buy antibiotics and he could buy refrigeration. He could buy things that King Henry, in all his wealth, could never buy. That's what progress is about.So, technology is selfish; technology is generous. That conflict, that tension, will be with us forever: sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do, and sometimes it's going to do things for us. We have confusion about what we should think about a new technology. Right now the default position when a new technology comes along, is people talk about the precautionary principle, which is very common in Europe, which says, basically, \"Don't do anything. When you meet a new technology, stop, until it can be proven that it does no harm.\" I think that really leads nowhere.But a better way is what I call the proactionary principle, which is, you engage with technology. You try it out. You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests, you try to anticipate it, but after anticipating it, you constantly asses it, not just once, but eternally. And when it diverts from what you want, we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff, but the old stuff. We fix it; but most importantly, we relocate it. And what I mean by that is, we find a new job for it.Nuclear energy, fission, is a really bad idea for bombs. But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy for electricity, instead of burning coal. When we have a bad idea, the response to a bad idea is not no ideas, it's not to stop thinking. The response to a bad idea \u2014 like, say, a tungsten lightbulb \u2014 is a better idea. So, better ideas is really always the response to technology we don't like; it's basically better technology. And actually, in a certain sense, technology is a kind of a method for generating better ideas, if you can think about it that way.So, maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea. But DDT sprayed on local homes \u2014 there's nothing better to eliminate malaria, besides insect DDT-impregnated mosquito nets. But that's a really good idea; that's a good job for technology.So our job as humans is to parent our mind children, to find them good friends, to find them a good job. And so, every technology is sort of a creative force looking for the right job. That's actually my son, right here.(Laughter)There are no bad technologies, just as there are no bad children. We don't say children are neutral; children are positive. We just have to find them the right place.And so, what technology gives us over the long term \u2014 over this sort of extended evolution from the beginning of time, through the invention of the plants and animals, and the evolution of life, the evolution of brains \u2014 what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences: It's increasing diversity, it's increasing options, it's increasing choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms. That's what we get from technology all the time. That's why people leave villages and go into cities \u2014 because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities. And we are aware of the price; we pay a price for that, but we're aware of it, and generally, we will pay the price for increased freedoms, choices and opportunities.Even technology wants clean water. Is technology diametrically opposed to nature? Because technology is an extension of life, it's in parallel and aligned with the same things that life wants. So that I think technology loves biology, if we allow it to. Great movement starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go, and our choice, so to speak, in technology, is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves.So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket; it's more than just gadgets, it's more than just things that people invent. It's actually part of a very long story \u2014 a great story \u2014 that began billions of years ago. It's moving through us, this self-organization, and we're extending and accelerating it, and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it. And I really appreciate your attention today.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 770, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.509\nI want to talk about my investigations\n\n00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:20.077\ninto what technology means in our lives --\n\n00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.309\nnot just our immediate life,\nbut in the cosmic sense,\n\n00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.475\nin the kind of long history of the world\n\n00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.078\nand our place in the world.\n\n00:00:29.102 --> 00:00:30.976\nWhat is this stuff?\n\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.460\nWhat is the significance?\n\n00:00:32.484 --> 00:00:36.392\nAnd so, I want to kind of\ngo through my little story\n\n00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:37.662\nof what I found out.\n\n00:00:37.686 --> 00:00:39.973\nOne of the first things\nI started to investigate\n\n00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:42.808\nwas the history of the name of technology.\n\n00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:45.786\nIn the United States,\nthere is a State of the Union address\n\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.705\ngiven by every president since 1790.\n\n00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.767\nAnd each one of those is kind of\nsumming up the most important things\n\n00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:55.497\nfor the United States at that time.\n\n00:00:55.521 --> 00:01:00.807\nIf you search for the word \"technology,\"\nit was not used until 1952.\n\n00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:04.929\nSo, technology was sort of absent\nfrom everybody's thinking until 1952,\n\n00:01:04.953 --> 00:01:07.004\nwhich happened to be the year of my birth.\n\n00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:10.021\nAnd obviously, technology\nhad existed before then,\n\n00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:11.450\nbut we weren't aware of it.\n\n00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:16.072\nAnd so it was sort of an awakening\nof this force in our life.\n\n00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:20.309\nI actually did research to find out\nthe first use of the word \"technology.\"\n\n00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.309\nIt was in 1829,\n\n00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.309\nand it was invented by a guy\nwho was starting a curriculum --\n\n00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.959\na course, bringing together all the kinds\nof arts and crafts, and industry --\n\n00:01:29.983 --> 00:01:31.944\nand he called it \"Technology.\"\n\n00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:34.451\nAnd that's the very first use of the word.\n\n00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:36.641\nSo what is this stuff\n\n00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:40.465\nthat we're all consumed by\nand bothered by?\n\n00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.898\nAlan Kay calls it, \"Technology\nis anything that was invented\n\n00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:46.151\nafter you were born.\"\n\n00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:47.183\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:51.642\nWhich is sort of the idea we normally\nhave about what technology is:\n\n00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.309\nit's all that new stuff.\n\n00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.536\nIt's not roads, or penicillin,\n\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.323\nor factory tires; it's the new stuff.\n\n00:01:59.347 --> 00:02:01.870\nMy friend Danny Hillis\nsays kind of a similar one,\n\n00:02:01.894 --> 00:02:04.573\nhe says, \"Technology is anything\nthat doesn't work yet.\"\n\n00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:05.612\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:07.676\nWhich is, again,\na sense that it's all new.\n\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.408\nBut we know that it's just not new.\n\n00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:10.718\nIt actually goes way back,\n\n00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:14.843\nand what I want to suggest is,\nit goes a long way back.\n\n00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.635\nSo, another way to think\nabout technology, what it means,\n\n00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.683\nis to imagine a world without technology.\n\n00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:23.368\nIf we were to eliminate every single bit\nof technology in the world today --\n\n00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:28.309\nand I mean everything,\nfrom blades to scrapers to cloth --\n\n00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.068\nwe, as a species,\nwould not live very long.\n\n00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:34.069\nWe would die by the billions,\nand very quickly:\n\n00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:37.398\nthe wolves would get us,\nwe would be defenseless,\n\n00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:40.615\nwe would be unable to grow\nenough food or find enough food.\n\n00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.075\nEven the hunter-gatherers\nused some elementary tools.\n\n00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.431\nSo, they had minimal technology,\n\n00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:48.137\nbut they had some technology.\n\n00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:51.294\nAnd if we study\nthose hunter-gatherer tribes\n\n00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:54.970\nand the Neanderthal,\nwhich are very similar to early man,\n\n00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:58.281\nwe find out a very curious thing\nabout this world without technology,\n\n00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:01.134\nand this is a kind of a curve\nof their average age.\n\n00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:05.613\nThere are no Neanderthal fossils\nthat are older than 40 years old\n\n00:03:05.637 --> 00:03:07.248\nthat we've ever found,\n\n00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:11.502\nand the average age of most of these\nhunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.\n\n00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:16.427\nThere are very few young infants,\nbecause they die -- high mortality rate --\n\n00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:17.999\nand there's very few old people.\n\n00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:21.603\nSo the profile is sort of for your average\nSan Francisco neighborhood:\n\n00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:23.032\na lot of young people.\n\n00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:26.120\nAnd if you go there, you say,\n\"Hey, everybody's really healthy.\"\n\n00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:28.048\nWell, that's because they're all young.\n\n00:03:28.072 --> 00:03:30.803\nSame thing with the hunter-gatherer\ntribes and early man:\n\n00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:32.622\nyou didn't live beyond the age of 30.\n\n00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:34.623\nSo it was a world without grandparents.\n\n00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.680\nAnd grandparents are very important,\n\n00:03:36.704 --> 00:03:40.343\nbecause they are the transmitter\nof cultural evolution and information.\n\n00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.503\nImagine a world where basically\neverybody was 20 to 30 years old.\n\n00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:45.171\nHow much learning can you do?\n\n00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:47.530\nYou can't do very much\nlearning in your own life,\n\n00:03:47.554 --> 00:03:48.852\nit's so short,\n\n00:03:48.876 --> 00:03:51.230\nand there's nobody to pass on\nwhat you do learn.\n\n00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:54.201\nSo that's one aspect.\n\n00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:55.541\nIt was a very short life.\n\n00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.357\nBut at the same time, anthropologists know\n\n00:03:58.381 --> 00:04:00.961\nthat most hunter-gatherer\ntribes of the world,\n\n00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:02.647\nwith that very little technology,\n\n00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:06.157\nactually did not spend a very long time\ngathering the food they needed:\n\n00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:07.764\nthree to six hours a day.\n\n00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:11.809\nSome anthropologists call that\nthe original affluent society,\n\n00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.199\nbecause they had\nbankers' hours, basically.\n\n00:04:14.223 --> 00:04:16.857\nSo it was possible to get enough food.\n\n00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:19.382\nBut when the scarcity came,\n\n00:04:19.406 --> 00:04:21.689\nwhen the highs and lows\nand the droughts came,\n\n00:04:21.713 --> 00:04:24.246\nthen people went into starvation.\n\n00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.318\nAnd that's why they didn't live very long.\n\n00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:28.757\nSo what technology brought,\n\n00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:32.230\nthrough the very simple tools\nlike these stone tools here --\n\n00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.194\neven something as small as this --\n\n00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:40.623\nthe early bands of humans were actually\nable to eliminate to extinction\n\n00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:45.739\nabout 250 megafauna animals\nin North America\n\n00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:47.952\nwhen they first arrived 10,000 years ago.\n\n00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.617\nSo, long before the industrial age,\n\n00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.309\nwe've been affecting\nthe planet on a global scale\n\n00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.464\nwith just a small amount of technology.\n\n00:04:55.488 --> 00:04:58.784\nThe other thing that the early man\ninvented was fire.\n\n00:04:58.808 --> 00:05:00.933\nAnd fire was used to clear out, and again,\n\n00:05:00.957 --> 00:05:04.605\naffected the ecology of grass\nand whole continents,\n\n00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.027\nand was used in cooking.\n\n00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:09.506\nIt enabled us to actually\neat all kinds of things.\n\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.784\nIt was, in a certain sense,\nin a McLuhan sense,\n\n00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:13.916\nan external stomach,\n\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.435\nin the sense that it was cooking food\nthat we could not eat otherwise.\n\n00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:20.203\nAnd if we didn't have fire,\nwe actually could not live.\n\n00:05:20.227 --> 00:05:23.369\nOur bodies have adapted\nto these new diets.\n\n00:05:23.393 --> 00:05:26.188\nOur bodies have changed\nin the last 10,000 years.\n\n00:05:26.212 --> 00:05:29.268\nSo, with that little bit of technology,\n\n00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.568\nhumans went from a small band\nof 10,000 or so --\n\n00:05:31.592 --> 00:05:33.741\nthe same number\nas Neanderthals everywhere --\n\n00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:35.003\nand we suddenly exploded.\n\n00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:37.628\nWith the invention of language\naround 50,000 years ago,\n\n00:05:37.652 --> 00:05:39.145\nthe number of humans exploded,\n\n00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.293\nand very quickly became\nthe dominant species on the planet.\n\n00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:44.759\nAnd they migrated\ninto the rest of the world\n\n00:05:44.783 --> 00:05:46.223\nat two kilometers per year\n\n00:05:46.247 --> 00:05:49.224\nuntil, within several tens\nof thousands of years,\n\n00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.523\nwe occupied every single\nwatershed on the planet\n\n00:05:51.547 --> 00:05:53.365\nand became the most dominant species,\n\n00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.752\nwith a very small amount of technology.\n\n00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:58.856\nAnd even at that time,\nwith the introduction of agriculture,\n\n00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.590\n8,000, 10,000 years ago,\n\n00:06:00.614 --> 00:06:02.309\nwe started to see climate change.\n\n00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:05.917\nSo climate change is not a new thing;\nwhat's new is just the degree of it.\n\n00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:09.016\nEven during the agricultural age,\nthere was climate change.\n\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.776\nSo already, small amounts of technology\nwere transforming the world.\n\n00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.461\nAnd what this means, and where I'm going,\n\n00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:19.309\nis that technology has become\nthe most powerful force in the world.\n\n00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:22.260\nAll the things we see today\nthat are changing our lives,\n\n00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:23.471\nwe can always trace back\n\n00:06:23.495 --> 00:06:25.560\nto the introduction\nof some new technology.\n\n00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:26.889\nSo it's a force,\n\n00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:30.984\nthat is the most powerful force\nthat has been unleashed on this planet,\n\n00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:32.817\nand in such a degree,\n\n00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:39.062\nthat I think it's become who we are.\n\n00:06:39.086 --> 00:06:42.341\nIn fact, our humanity and everything\nthat we think about ourselves,\n\n00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:43.833\nis something we've invented.\n\n00:06:43.857 --> 00:06:45.264\nSo we've invented ourselves.\n\n00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:47.406\nOf all the animals\nthat we've domesticated,\n\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.545\nthe most important animal has been us.\n\n00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:54.309\nSo humanity is our greatest invention,\n\n00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.309\nbut of course, we're not done yet.\n\n00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:57.495\nWe're still inventing,\n\n00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:59.857\nand this is what technology\nis allowing us to do;\n\n00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:01.917\nit's continually to reinvent ourselves.\n\n00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:04.364\nIt's a very, very strong force.\n\n00:07:04.388 --> 00:07:07.523\nI call this entire thing --\nus humans as our technology,\n\n00:07:07.547 --> 00:07:10.309\neverything that we've made,\ngadgets in our lives --\n\n00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:11.596\nwe call that the technium.\n\n00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.780\nThat's this world.\n\n00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:14.709\nMy working definition of technology is:\n\n00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:17.106\nanything useful that a human mind makes.\n\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.788\nIt's not just hammers\nand gadgets, like laptops.\n\n00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:21.233\nBut it's also law.\n\n00:07:21.257 --> 00:07:26.400\nAnd, of course, cities are ways\nto make things more useful to us.\n\n00:07:26.424 --> 00:07:28.889\nWhile this is something\nthat comes from our mind,\n\n00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:33.206\nit also has its roots\ndeeply into the cosmos.\n\n00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.393\nIt goes back.\n\n00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:37.280\nThe origins and roots of technology\ngo back to the Big Bang,\n\n00:07:37.304 --> 00:07:41.792\nin this way, in that they are part\nof this self-organizing thread\n\n00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:46.371\nthat starts at the Big Bang\nand goes through galaxies and stars,\n\n00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:47.953\ninto life, into us.\n\n00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:50.605\nAnd the three major phases\nof the early universe\n\n00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:52.851\nwas energy, when the dominant\nforce was energy;\n\n00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.915\nthen the dominant force,\nas it cooled, became matter;\n\n00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:59.309\nand then, with the invention\nof life four billion years ago,\n\n00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:02.119\nthe dominant force in our neighborhood\nbecame information.\n\n00:08:02.143 --> 00:08:03.327\nThat's what life is:\n\n00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:05.511\nan information process\nthat was restructuring\n\n00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:06.757\nand making new order.\n\n00:08:06.781 --> 00:08:10.398\nSo, energy and matter,\nEinstein showed were equivalent,\n\n00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:16.042\nand now new sciences of quantum computing\nshow that entropy and information\n\n00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:17.516\nand matter and energy\n\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.704\nare all interrelated.\n\n00:08:18.728 --> 00:08:20.265\nSo it's one long continuum.\n\n00:08:21.162 --> 00:08:24.357\nYou put energy\ninto the right kind of system,\n\n00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:27.455\nand out comes wasted heat, entropy,\n\n00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:30.309\nand extropy, which is order.\n\n00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:31.663\nIt's the increased order.\n\n00:08:31.687 --> 00:08:33.240\nWhere does this order come from?\n\n00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:34.535\nIts roots go way back.\n\n00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.892\nWe actually don't know.\n\n00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:37.128\nBut we do know\n\n00:08:37.152 --> 00:08:41.447\nthat the self-organization trend\nthroughout the universe is long,\n\n00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:43.694\nand it began with things like galaxies;\n\n00:08:43.718 --> 00:08:46.212\nthey maintained their order\nfor billions of years.\n\n00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:50.086\nStars are basically\nnuclear fission machines\n\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.409\nthat self-organize and self-sustain\nthemselves for billions of years:\n\n00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:55.564\norder against the extropy of the world.\n\n00:08:55.588 --> 00:09:00.498\nAnd flowers and plants\nare the same thing, extended,\n\n00:09:00.522 --> 00:09:05.269\nand technology is basically\nan extension of life.\n\n00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:09.159\nOne trend that we notice\nin all those things\n\n00:09:09.183 --> 00:09:11.755\nis that the amount of energy\nper gram per second\n\n00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.062\nthat flows through this\n\n00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:14.377\nis actually increasing.\n\n00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:18.980\nThe amount of energy is increasing\nthrough this little sequence.\n\n00:09:19.004 --> 00:09:22.981\nAnd the amount of energy per gram\nper second that flows through life\n\n00:09:23.005 --> 00:09:24.982\nis actually greater than a star --\n\n00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:28.309\nbecause of the star's long lifespan,\n\n00:09:28.333 --> 00:09:31.522\nthe energy density in life\nis actually higher than a star.\n\n00:09:31.546 --> 00:09:34.405\nAnd the energy density\nthat we see in the greatest amount\n\n00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:35.635\nanywhere in the universe\n\n00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:36.992\nis actually in a PC chip.\n\n00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:40.166\nThere is more energy flowing\nthrough, per gram per second,\n\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.308\nthan anything that we have\nany other experience with.\n\n00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:44.961\nAnd so, what I would suggest\n\n00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:47.926\nis that if you want to see\nwhere technology is going,\n\n00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.582\nwe continue that trajectory,\n\n00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:52.459\nand we say, \"Well, it's going\nto become more energy-dense,\n\n00:09:52.483 --> 00:09:53.700\nthat's where it's going.\"\n\n00:09:53.724 --> 00:09:56.692\nAnd so what I've done is,\nI've taken the same kinds of things\n\n00:09:56.716 --> 00:09:59.982\nand looked at other aspects\nof evolutionary life and say,\n\n00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:02.612\n\"What are the general trends\nin evolutionary life?\"\n\n00:10:02.636 --> 00:10:05.358\nAnd there are things moving\ntowards greater complexity,\n\n00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:09.309\nmoving towards greater diversity,\nmoving towards greater specialization,\n\n00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:13.575\nsentience, ubiquity,\nand most important, evolvability.\n\n00:10:13.599 --> 00:10:17.122\nThose very same things\nare also present in technology.\n\n00:10:17.146 --> 00:10:18.995\nThat's where technology is going.\n\n00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:23.462\nIn fact, technology\nis accelerating all the aspects of life.\n\n00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:25.831\nAnd we can see that happening;\n\n00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:30.006\njust as there's diversity in life,\nthere's more diversity in things we make.\n\n00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.180\nThings in life start off\nbeing general cells,\n\n00:10:32.204 --> 00:10:33.585\nand they become specialized:\n\n00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:35.746\nyou have tissue cells,\nmuscle, brain cells.\n\n00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.800\nThe same thing happens\nwith, say, a hammer,\n\n00:10:37.824 --> 00:10:40.309\nwhich is general at first\nand becomes more specific.\n\n00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:43.429\nSo I would like to say\nthat while there are six kingdoms of life,\n\n00:10:43.453 --> 00:10:47.034\nwe can think of technology\nbasically as a seventh kingdom of life.\n\n00:10:47.058 --> 00:10:49.389\nIt's a branching off from the human form.\n\n00:10:49.413 --> 00:10:53.309\nBut technology has its own agenda,\nlike anything, like life itself.\n\n00:10:53.333 --> 00:10:56.475\nFor instance, right now,\nthree-quarters of the energy that we use\n\n00:10:56.499 --> 00:10:58.631\nis actually used to feed\nthe technium itself.\n\n00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:00.547\nIn transportation, it's not to move us;\n\n00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:02.440\nit's to move the stuff we make or buy.\n\n00:11:02.464 --> 00:11:04.441\nI use the word \"want.\" Technology wants.\n\n00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:07.467\nThis is a robot that wants to plug\nitself in to get more power.\n\n00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:10.070\nYour cat wants more food.\n\n00:11:10.094 --> 00:11:12.657\nA bacterium, which has\nno consciousness at all,\n\n00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:14.309\nwants to move towards light.\n\n00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:17.021\nIt has an urge,\nand technology has an urge.\n\n00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:19.189\nAt the same time,\nit wants to give us things,\n\n00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:21.767\nand what it gives us\nis basically progress.\n\n00:11:21.791 --> 00:11:24.863\nYou can take all kinds of curves,\nand they're all pointing up.\n\n00:11:24.887 --> 00:11:27.309\nThere's really no dispute about progress,\n\n00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.309\nif we discount the cost of that.\n\n00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.524\nAnd that's the thing\nthat bothers most people,\n\n00:11:32.548 --> 00:11:36.412\nis that progress is really real,\nbut we wonder and question:\n\n00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:38.309\nWhat are the environmental costs of it?\n\n00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:42.160\nI did a survey of the number\nof species of artifacts in my house,\n\n00:11:42.184 --> 00:11:43.342\nand there's 6,000.\n\n00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.435\nOther people have come up with 10,000.\n\n00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:47.899\nWhen King Henry of England died,\n\n00:11:47.923 --> 00:11:49.977\nhe had 18,000 things in his house,\n\n00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.478\nbut that was the entire\nwealth of England, so ...\n\n00:11:53.502 --> 00:11:54.712\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:54.736 --> 00:11:57.242\nAnd with that entire wealth of England,\n\n00:11:57.266 --> 00:12:00.192\nKing Henry could not buy any antibiotics,\n\n00:12:00.216 --> 00:12:01.766\nhe could not buy refrigeration,\n\n00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.923\nhe could not buy\na trip of a thousand miles,\n\n00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:08.411\nwhereas this rickshaw wallah in India\ncould save up and buy antibiotics\n\n00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:10.178\nand he could buy refrigeration.\n\n00:12:10.202 --> 00:12:13.673\nHe could buy things that King Henry,\nin all his wealth, could never buy.\n\n00:12:13.697 --> 00:12:15.364\nThat's what progress is about.\n\n00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:18.309\nSo, technology is selfish;\ntechnology is generous.\n\n00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:21.529\nThat conflict, that tension,\nwill be with us forever:\n\n00:12:21.553 --> 00:12:23.751\nsometimes it wants to do\nwhat it wants to do,\n\n00:12:23.775 --> 00:12:25.895\nand sometimes it's going\nto do things for us.\n\n00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.986\nWe have confusion\nabout what we should think\n\n00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.309\nabout a new technology.\n\n00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:33.163\nRight now the default position\nwhen a new technology comes along,\n\n00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:35.512\nis people talk about\nthe precautionary principle,\n\n00:12:35.536 --> 00:12:37.422\nwhich is very common in Europe,\n\n00:12:37.446 --> 00:12:39.493\nwhich says, basically, \"Don't do anything.\n\n00:12:39.517 --> 00:12:42.131\nWhen you meet a new technology, stop,\n\n00:12:42.155 --> 00:12:44.684\nuntil it can be proven\nthat it does no harm.\"\n\n00:12:44.708 --> 00:12:46.953\nI think that really leads nowhere.\n\n00:12:46.977 --> 00:12:49.978\nBut a better way is\nwhat I call the proactionary principle,\n\n00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.408\nwhich is, you engage with technology.\n\n00:12:52.432 --> 00:12:53.810\nYou try it out.\n\n00:12:53.834 --> 00:12:58.050\nYou obviously do what the precautionary\nprinciple suggests,\n\n00:12:58.074 --> 00:12:59.319\nyou try to anticipate it,\n\n00:12:59.343 --> 00:13:00.770\nbut after anticipating it,\n\n00:13:00.794 --> 00:13:02.309\nyou constantly asses it,\n\n00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:03.896\nnot just once, but eternally.\n\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.097\nAnd when it diverts from what you want,\n\n00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:10.282\nwe prioritize risk,\nwe evaluate not just the new stuff,\n\n00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:11.465\nbut the old stuff.\n\n00:13:11.489 --> 00:13:13.359\nWe fix it; but most importantly,\n\n00:13:13.383 --> 00:13:14.540\nwe relocate it.\n\n00:13:14.564 --> 00:13:16.388\nAnd what I mean by that is,\n\n00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:18.120\nwe find a new job for it.\n\n00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:22.154\nNuclear energy, fission,\nis a really bad idea for bombs.\n\n00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:27.573\nBut it may be a pretty good idea\nrelocated into sustainable nuclear energy\n\n00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:29.915\nfor electricity, instead of burning coal.\n\n00:13:29.939 --> 00:13:31.654\nWhen we have a bad idea,\n\n00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:33.242\nthe response to a bad idea\n\n00:13:33.266 --> 00:13:36.586\nis not no ideas,\nit's not to stop thinking.\n\n00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.763\nThe response to a bad idea --\n\n00:13:38.787 --> 00:13:40.915\nlike, say, a tungsten lightbulb --\n\n00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:43.178\nis a better idea.\n\n00:13:43.671 --> 00:13:47.151\nSo, better ideas\nis really always the response\n\n00:13:47.175 --> 00:13:48.540\nto technology we don't like;\n\n00:13:48.564 --> 00:13:50.651\nit's basically better technology.\n\n00:13:51.157 --> 00:13:54.977\nAnd actually, in a certain sense,\ntechnology is a kind of a method\n\n00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:56.556\nfor generating better ideas,\n\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.309\nif you can think about it that way.\n\n00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.428\nSo, maybe spraying DDT\non crops is a really bad idea.\n\n00:14:01.452 --> 00:14:04.309\nBut DDT sprayed on local homes --\n\n00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:07.309\nthere's nothing better\nto eliminate malaria,\n\n00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:11.071\nbesides insect DDT-impregnated\nmosquito nets.\n\n00:14:11.095 --> 00:14:14.426\nBut that's a really good idea;\nthat's a good job for technology.\n\n00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.309\nSo our job as humans\nis to parent our mind children,\n\n00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:19.777\nto find them good friends,\n\n00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:21.193\nto find them a good job.\n\n00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:24.025\nAnd so, every technology\nis sort of a creative force\n\n00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:26.069\nlooking for the right job.\n\n00:14:26.093 --> 00:14:28.184\nThat's actually my son, right here.\n\n00:14:28.208 --> 00:14:29.531\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:32.047\nThere are no bad technologies,\n\n00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.767\njust as there are no bad children.\n\n00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:36.673\nWe don't say children are neutral;\nchildren are positive.\n\n00:14:36.697 --> 00:14:39.024\nWe just have to find them the right place.\n\n00:14:39.048 --> 00:14:43.002\nAnd so, what technology gives us\nover the long term --\n\n00:14:43.026 --> 00:14:46.667\nover this sort of extended evolution\nfrom the beginning of time,\n\n00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:50.309\nthrough the invention\nof the plants and animals,\n\n00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.309\nand the evolution of life,\nthe evolution of brains --\n\n00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:57.244\nwhat that is constantly giving us\nis increasing differences:\n\n00:14:57.268 --> 00:14:59.723\nIt's increasing diversity,\nit's increasing options,\n\n00:14:59.747 --> 00:15:03.725\nit's increasing choices, opportunities,\npossibilities and freedoms.\n\n00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:06.673\nThat's what we get\nfrom technology all the time.\n\n00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:09.513\nThat's why people leave villages\nand go into cities --\n\n00:15:09.537 --> 00:15:13.186\nbecause they are always gravitating\ntowards increased choices\n\n00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.447\nand possibilities.\n\n00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:17.100\nAnd we are aware of the price;\n\n00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:19.363\nwe pay a price for that,\nbut we're aware of it,\n\n00:15:19.387 --> 00:15:22.342\nand generally, we will pay the price\nfor increased freedoms,\n\n00:15:22.366 --> 00:15:23.754\nchoices and opportunities.\n\n00:15:24.263 --> 00:15:26.971\nEven technology wants clean water.\n\n00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:31.176\nIs technology diametrically\nopposed to nature?\n\n00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.058\nBecause technology\nis an extension of life,\n\n00:15:34.082 --> 00:15:36.925\nit's in parallel and aligned\nwith the same things\n\n00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:38.252\nthat life wants.\n\n00:15:38.832 --> 00:15:41.007\nSo that I think technology loves biology,\n\n00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:42.582\nif we allow it to.\n\n00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:47.309\nGreat movement\nstarting billions of years ago\n\n00:15:47.333 --> 00:15:49.637\nis moving through us\nand it continues to go,\n\n00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:53.074\nand our choice, so to speak,\nin technology,\n\n00:15:53.098 --> 00:15:55.169\nis really to align ourselves\nwith this force\n\n00:15:55.193 --> 00:15:56.577\nmuch greater than ourselves.\n\n00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.409\nSo, technology is more\nthan just the stuff in your pocket;\n\n00:15:59.433 --> 00:16:00.824\nit's more than just gadgets,\n\n00:16:00.848 --> 00:16:03.313\nit's more than just things\nthat people invent.\n\n00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:06.724\nIt's actually part of a very long\nstory -- a great story --\n\n00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:08.381\nthat began billions of years ago.\n\n00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:10.712\nIt's moving through us,\nthis self-organization,\n\n00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.713\nand we're extending and accelerating

If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there. Well, law is also a powerful driver of human behavior. And what I'd like to discuss today is the need to overhaul and simplify the law to release the energy and passion of Americans, so that we can begin to address the challenges of our society.You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed, there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company, because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this, it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people.A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming. It was in a grizzly bear preserve, although no one told me that before we went. And our guide was a local science teacher. She was wholly unconcerned about the bears, but she was terrified of lawyers. The stories started pouring out. She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent had threatened to sue the school because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent when he turned the paper in late. The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings. So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made over and over again. After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated and raised the grade. She said, \"Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this.\"About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away, and she was going to drive them in her car, but the school said, \"No, you can't drive them in the car for liability reasons. You have to go in a school bus.\" So, they provided a bus that held 60 people and drove the three of them back and forth several hours to Laramie.Her husband is also a science teacher, and he takes his biology class on a hike in the nearby national park. But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year because one of the students in the class was disabled, so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either. At the end of this day I could have filled a book just with stories about law from this one teacher.Now, we've been taught to believe that law is the foundation of freedom. But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades, the land of the free has become a legal minefield. It's really changed our lives in ways that are sort of imperceptible; and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time. It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a pediatrician friend in North Carolina. He said, \"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore. You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff that might be used against you.\" This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people. My own law firm has a list of questions that I'm not allowed to ask when interviewing candidates, such as the sinister question, bulging with hidden motives and innuendo, \"Where are you from?\" (Laughter)Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.But the reality is, these crazy cases are relatively rare. They don't usually win. And the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent, which is twice as much as in other countries but, as taxes go, hardly crippling. But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.What's happened here, again, almost without our knowing, is our culture has changed. People no longer feel free to act on their best judgment. So, what do we do about it? We certainly don't want to give up the rights, when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts. We need regulation to make sure people don't pollute and such. We lack even a vocabulary to deal with this problem, and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute, every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights. And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything. Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances that explain why Johnny turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming? Is it possible that the doctor might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker? And of course the hindsight bias is perfect. There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out where it's possible that something could have been done differently.And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope, hoping that we can judge any dispute against the standard of a perfect society, where everyone will agree what's fair, and where accidents will be extinct, risk will be no more. Of course, this is Utopia; it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom. It's not the basis of the rule of law, it's not the basis of a free society. So, now I have the first of four propositions I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law: You've got to judge law mainly by its effect on the broader society, not individual disputes. Absolutely vital.So, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second and look at our society from high above. Is it working? What does the macro-data show us? Well, the healthcare system has been transformed: a culture pervaded with defensiveness, universal distrust of the system of justice, universal practice of defensive medicine. It's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives. Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes, and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong. But reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year. That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it.The trial lawyers say, \"Well, this legal fear makes doctors practice better medicine.\" Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine and others. Turns out that's not the case. The fear has chilled professional interaction so thousands of tragic errors occur because doctors are afraid to speak up: \"Are you sure that's the right dosage?\" Because they're not sure, and they don't want to take legal responsibility.Let's go to schools. As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming, she seems to be affected by the law. Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law. You could have a separate section of a law library around each of the following legal concepts: due process, special education, no child left behind, zero tolerance, work rules ... it goes on. We did a study of all the rules that affect one school in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea. Tens of thousands of discreet rules, 60 steps to suspend a student from school: It's a formula for paralysis. What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.Again, studies have shown it's directly attributable to the rise of due process. Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America say that they spend at least half of their time maintaining order in the classroom. That means those students are getting half the learning they're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class no one can learn. And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order? They're threatened with a legal claim. We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights, with lawsuits by their students. They are threatening, their students. It's not that they usually sue, it's not that they would win, but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority.And how has this system of law worked for government? It doesn't seem to be working very well does it? Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington. The other day at the State of the Union speech, President Obama said, and I think we could all agree with this goal, \"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been the first to compete. There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains.\" Well, actually there is a reason: Environmental review has evolved into a process of no pebble left unturned for any major project taking the better part of a decade, then followed by years of litigation by anybody who doesn't like the project.Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second, people are acting like idiots, (Laughter) all across the country. (Applause) Idiots. A couple of years ago, Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess. (Laughter) That means all the boys are going to be ADD. I mean it's just absolutely a formula for failure.My favorite, though, are all the warning labels. \"Caution: Contents are hot,\" on billions of coffee cups. Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff, but they'll see all these labels, \"Contents are extremely hot.\" They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot? My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure, with a three pronged hook in the back, and outside it said, \"Harmful if swallowed.\" (Laughter)So, none of these people are doing what they think is right. And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law? Because it gives us the worst of both worlds: It's random \u2014 anybody can sue for almost anything and take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency \u2014 and it's also too detailed. In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules no human could possibly know it. Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle. But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law, because the hurdle for success is trust.People \u2014 for law to be the platform for freedom, people have to trust it. So, that's my second proposition: Trust is an essential condition to a free society. Life is complicated enough without legal fear. But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties, because it carries with it the power of state. And so the state can come in. It actually changes the way people think. It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders all day long, whispering in your ear, \"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?\" It drives people from the smart part of the brain \u2014 that dark, deep well of the subconscious, where instincts and experience, and all the other factors of creativity and good judgment are \u2014 it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.Pretty soon the doctor's saying, \"Well, I doubt if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI.\" Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests. If you make people self-conscious about their judgments, studies show you will make them make worse judgments. If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes when she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece. Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment. Edison stated it best. He said, \"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here, we're trying to accomplish something.\" (Laughter)So, how do you restore trust? Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough, and tort reform, which is a great idea, lowers your cost if you're a businessperson, but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust. States with extensive tort reform still suffer all these pathologies. So, what's needed is not just to limit claims, but actually create a dry ground of freedom. It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure. And it is this: Law sets boundaries, and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do \u2014 you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes \u2014 but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom.Isaiah Berlin put it this way: \"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable.\" We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So, what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over, \"A kid fell off the seesaw,\" it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit, all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms, merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes, nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four, because there's no risk associated with it.So, how do we rebuild it? Life is too complex for... (Applause) Life is too complex for a software program. All these choices involve value judgments and social norms, not objective facts. And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it: We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only 16 pages long. Worked pretty well for 200 years.Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices. If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it. And how do you make it simple? Because life is complex, and here is the hardest and biggest change: We have to restore the authority to judges and officials to interpret and apply the law. (Applause) We have to rehumanize the law. To make law simple so that you feel free, the people in charge have to be free to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law in accord with reasonable social norms. As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day, you have to think that if there is a dispute, there's somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you're acting reasonably. That person doesn't exist today.This is the hardest hurdle. It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake. Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court for your lost pair of pants for $100, but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars. Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court. Takes five minutes. That's it, it's not that hard.But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand because we woke up in the 1960s to all these really bad values: racism, gender discrimination, pollution \u2014 they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system where no one could have bad values anymore. The problem is, we created a system where we eliminated the right to have good values. It doesn't mean that people in authority can do whatever they want. They're still bounded by legal goals and principles: The teacher is accountable to the principal, the judge is accountable to an appellate court, the president is accountable to voters. But the accountability's up the line judging the decision against the effect on everybody, not just on the disgruntled person. You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator. (Applause)So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy. We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy. We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom. It's not true. Authority, in fact, is essential to freedom. Law is a human institution; responsibility is a human institution. If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom, to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers. If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims, then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders. If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment, then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city. A free society requires red lights and green lights, otherwise it soon descends into gridlock. That's what's happened to America. Look around.What the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices. It's the only way to get our freedom back, and it's the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time. Thank you.

going to take two students to a leadership conference\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nand she was going to drive them in her car,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nbut the school said, \"No, you can't drive them in the car\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nfor liability reasons.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nYou have to go in a school bus.\"\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nSo, they provided a bus that held 60 people\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand drove the three of them back and forth\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nseveral hours to Laramie.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nHer husband is also a science teacher,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand he takes his biology class on a hike\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nin the nearby national park.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nBut he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nbecause one of the students in the class was disabled,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nso the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAt the end of this day I could have filled a book\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\njust with stories about law\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nfrom this one teacher.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nNow, we've been taught to believe that law\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nis the foundation of freedom.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nBut somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthe land of the free has become a legal minefield.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nIt's really changed our lives in ways\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nthat are sort of imperceptible;\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nIt's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\npediatrician friend\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nin North Carolina. He said,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\n\"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nYou wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nthat might be used against you.\"\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThis is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nMy own law firm has a list of questions\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nthat I'm not allowed to ask\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nwhen interviewing candidates,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nsuch as the sinister question,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nbulging with hidden motives and innuendo,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nNow for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nthat lawsuits are out of control.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd we read every once in while\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nabout these crazy lawsuits, like the guy\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nin the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nbecause they lost his pair of pants.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThe case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nBut the reality is, these crazy cases\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nare relatively rare. They don't usually win.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd the total of direct tort cost\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nin this country is about two percent,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhich is twice as much as in other countries\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nbut, as taxes go, hardly crippling.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nBut the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nWhat's happened here, again,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nalmost without our knowing,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nis our culture has changed.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nPeople no longer feel free\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto act on their best judgment.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo, what do we do about it?\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWe certainly don't want to give up the rights,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwhen people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nWe need regulation to make sure\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\npeople don't pollute and such.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nWe lack even a vocabulary to deal with\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nthis problem,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nand that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nWe've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nevery issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nIs it possible that there are extenuating circumstances\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthat explain why Johnny\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nturned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nIs it possible that the doctor\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nmight have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd of course the hindsight bias is perfect.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThere's always a different scenario that you can sketch out\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwhere it's possible that something could have been done differently.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nhoping that we can judge any dispute\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nagainst the standard of a perfect society,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nwhere everyone will agree what's fair,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand where accidents will be extinct,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nrisk will be no more.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nOf course, this is Utopia;\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nit's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nIt's not the basis of the rule of law,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nit's not the basis of a free society.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nSo, now I have the first of four propositions\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nI'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nYou've got to judge law mainly\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nby its effect on the broader society,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nnot individual disputes.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAbsolutely vital.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nSo, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand look at our society from high above.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nIs it working?\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWhat does the macro-data show us?\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nWell, the healthcare system has been transformed:\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\na culture pervaded with defensiveness,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nuniversal distrust of the system of justice,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nuniversal practice of defensive medicine.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nIt's very hard to measure\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nbecause there are mixed motives.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nDoctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBut reliable estimates\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nrange between 60 billion and\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\n200 billion dollars per year.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThat's enough to provide care to all the people\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nin America who don't have it.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nThe trial lawyers say, \"Well, this legal fear\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nmakes doctors practice better medicine.\"\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nWell that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nand others. Turns out that's not the case.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe fear has chilled professional interaction\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nso thousands of tragic errors occur\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nbecause doctors are afraid\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nto speak up: \"Are you sure that's the right dosage?\"\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nBecause they're not sure,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand they don't want to take legal responsibility.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nLet's go to schools.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAs we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nshe seems to be affected by the law.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nWell it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nYou could have a separate section of a law library\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\naround each of the following legal concepts:\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\ndue process, special education,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nno child left behind,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nzero tolerance, work rules ...\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nit goes on. We did a study\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nof all the rules that affect one school\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nin New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nTens of thousands of discreet rules,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n60 steps to suspend a student from school:\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nIt's a formula for paralysis.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nWhat's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nAgain, studies have shown\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nit's directly attributable\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nto the rise of due process.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nPublic agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nwhere they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nsay that they spend at least half of their time\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nmaintaining order in the classroom.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThat means those students are getting half the learning\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nthey're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nno one can learn.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThey're threatened with a legal claim.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWe also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nin America have been threatened by their students\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nwith violating their rights, with lawsuits\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nby their students.

Authority, in fact,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nis essential to freedom.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nLaw is a human institution;\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nresponsibility is a human institution.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nIf teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nto maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nIf the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nthen all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nIf the environmental agency can't decide\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nthat the power lines are good for the environment,\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nthen there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nto the city.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nA free society requires red lights and green lights,\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\notherwise it soon descends into gridlock.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nThat's what's happened to America. Look around.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nWhat the world needs now\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nis to restore the authority to make common choices.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nIt's the only way to get our freedom back,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nand it's the only way to release the energy and passion\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nneeded so that we can meet the challenges\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nof our time.

Any guesses? 1816. And what I can say is, in 2016, doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes. There's a whole lot better technology coming, and that's part of the change in medicine.What has changed our society has been wireless devices. But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?So, let me give you some examples of this to kind of make this much more concrete. This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram. And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world on your smartphone, watching your rhythm \u2014 that's incredible, and it's with us today.But that's just the beginning. You check your email while you're sitting here. In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs, all your vital signs: your heart rhythm, your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc. This is already available today.This is AirStrip Technologies. It's now wired \u2014 or I should say, wireless \u2014 by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital, in the intensive care unit, and putting it on a smartphone for physicians. If you're an expectant parent, what about the ability to monitor, continuously, fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions, and not having to worry so much that things are fine as the pregnancy, and moving over into the time of delivery?And then as we go further, today we have continuous glucose sensors. Right now, they are under the skin, but in the future, they won't have to be implanted. And of course, the desired range \u2014 trying to keep glucose between 75 and less than 200, checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor \u2014 you'll see how that can impact diabetes.And what about sleep? We're going to zoom in on that a little bit. We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep. What if, on your phone, which will be available in the next few weeks, you had every minute of your sleep displayed? And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange. The REM sleep, rapid eye movement, dream state, is in light green; and light is gray, light sleep; and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep, is that dark green.How about counting every calorie? And this is ability, in real time, to actually take measurements of caloric intake as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.Now, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics. But what I want to get to, the next frontier, very quickly, and why the stethoscope is on its way out, is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds, and the breath sounds, because now, introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound. Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive. Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound, and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless, and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics \u2014 the key measurements of vital signs, and all those things in physiology \u2014 but also all the imaging that one could look at in your smartphone. Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology, soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor. Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires. This is now a little tiny patch. You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail.Now, how does this work? Well, there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist. And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway. Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway, as today many of these things are dedicated gateways, because they are not so well integrated. That signal goes to the web, the cloud, and then it can be processed and sent anywhere: to a caregiver, to a physician, back to the patient, etc. So, that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works.Now, I have this device on. I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on. This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm, as you saw already, but it also goes well beyond that. This is me now. And you can see the ECG. Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend; to the right of that is a bioconductant. That's the fluid status, fluid status, that's really important if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure. And below that's temperature, and respiration, and oxygen, and then the position activity. So, this is really striking, because this device measures seven things that are very much vital signs for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?And why is this important? Well, this is the most expensive bed. What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds? Well, we can. First of all, heart failure is the number one reason for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country. The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year, which is 80 percent related to hospitalization. And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older, is \u2014 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days, and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted. So, can we improve that? Well the idea is we take this device that I'm wearing, and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure, randomly assigned, versus 600 patients who don't have active monitoring, and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions, and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial, and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that, but that's a type of wireless device trial that could change medicine in the years ahead.Why now? Why has this all of a sudden become a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine? What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm. This sets up consumer-driven healthcare. That's where this is all starting. Let me just give you specifics about why this is a big movement if you're not aware of it: 1.2 million Americans have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod. And this Wired Magazine cover article really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology and energy expenditure. Here are some things, the principles that are guiding principles to keep in mind: \"A data-driven health revolution promises to make us all better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers.\" And this one, which is really telling, this was from July, this cover article:\"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet of life, from sleep to mood to pain, 24/7/365.\" Well, I tried this device. A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life. I didn't have one of those, but I got the Fitbit. That looks like this. It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer. And I want to just give you the results of that testing, because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement. I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better \u2014 I hope so. But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight. However you have to put in most of this stuff. The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity, and even then, it's not complete. So, you exercise and it picks up the exercise. You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI, and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending from the exercise, and how many you took in, if you go in and enter all the foods.But it really wants you to enter all your activity. And so I went to this, and of course I was gratified that it picked up the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did, but then it wants more information. So, it says, \"You want to log sexual activity. How long did you do it for?\" (Laughter) And it says, \"How hard was it?\" (Laughter) Furthermore it says, \"Start time.\" Now, this doesn't appear \u2014 this just doesn't work, I mean, this just doesn't work.So, now I want to move to sleep. Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG at your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way? This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock. It monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping. So, I did this thing for seven days getting ready for TEDMed. This is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.Of course how many here have any problems with sleeping? It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected. Okay, well this was a week of my life in sleeping, and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score, you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up. You say, \"Oh, OK.\" And a Z.Q. score is adjusted to age, and you want to get as high as you possibly can. So this is the moment-by-moment, or minute-by-minute sleep. And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd. And the wake time is in orange. And this can be a problem, as I learned. Because it not only helps you with quantifying your sleep, but also tells others you're awake. So, when my wife came in and she could tell you're awake. \"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk.\" And I'm trying to play possum. This thing is very, very impressive.OK. So, that's the first night. And this one is now 67, and that's not a good score. And this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep, in deep sleep, and all this sort of thing. This was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep. So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group. It's like a managed competition of sleep. And really interesting stuff. Look at this thing and say, \"Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper, but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds.\" OK? And the key thing was, what I didn't know, was that I was a really good dreamer.OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases. Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease, or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease, 140 million Americans have one or more chronic disease, and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease. Now, diabetes is one of the big ones. Almost 24 million people have diabetes. And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times, and it isn't looking good. That is, for men, 29 percent in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes, and women, although it's less, it's terribly high.But of course we have a way to measure that now on a continuous basis, with a sensor that detects blood glucose, and it's important because we could detect hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known, and also hypoglycemia. And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case, were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.But by continuous monitoring, it captures all that vital information. The future of this though, is being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon, and that's not so far away. So, let me just give you, very quickly, 10 top targets for wireless medicine. All these things are possible \u2014 some of them are very close, or already, as you heard, are available today, in some way or form.Alzheimer's disease: there's five million people affected, and you can check vital signs, activity, balance. Asthma: large number, we could detect things like pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer, I'll show you an example of that real quickly. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders. Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension: 74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring to come up with much better management and prevention. And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that. And sleep disorders.This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones and cell phones today is extraordinary. And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully about the opportunities in health across the developing world: \"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people, more quickly, than any previous technology.\" And that's before we got going on the m-health world. Aging: The problem is enormous, 300,000 broken hips per year; but the solutions are extraordinary, and they include so many different things.One of the ones I just wanted to mention: The iShoe is another example of a sensor that improves proprioception among the elderly to prevent falling. One of many different techniques using wireless sensors. So, we can change medicine across the continuum of care, across the ages from premies or unborn children to seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes; the full spectrum of disease \u2014 I hope I've given you a sense of that \u2014 across the globe.There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process. One of them \u2014 we're very fortunate \u2014 is to develop a dedicated institute and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ... and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West, to get behind this wireless health institute. San Diego is an extraordinary place for this. There's over 650 wireless companies, 100 of which or more are working in wireless health. It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.The wireless institute, the West Wireless Health Institute, is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people who are here this evening: Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this. (Applause) Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible, and this is really a nonprofit education center which is just about to open. It looks like this, this whole building dedicated. And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era: to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate \u2014 and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany, it was announced on Monday \u2014 then to move up with development, clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice, the most challenging thing of all, requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.The other big thing, besides having this fantastic institute to catalyze this process is guidance, and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital. If we understand biology from genomics and omics and wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big. Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before. Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level, but this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years than in the history of man. And when you put that together with, for example, now an app for the iPhone with your genotype to guide drug therapy ... but, the future \u2014 we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes from all the common variants, and that's going to get filled in more with low-frequency variants in the future. We can tell who's going to get breast cancer from the various genes. We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.And finally, another example: sudden cardiac death. Each of these has a sensor. We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it. We can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible, for breast cancer with an ultrasound device given to the patient. An iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation. And vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death. We lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.So, I hope I've convinced you of this, of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive across all these different diseases and more. It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height and it's hyper-innovative, and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.

This is an electrocardiogram.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAnd, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\na patient, an individual, anywhere in the world\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\non your smartphone,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nwatching your rhythm -- that's incredible,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand it's with us today.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nBut that's just the beginning.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nYou check your email while you're sitting here.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nIn the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nall your vital signs: your heart rhythm,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nyour blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nThis is already available today.\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nThis is AirStrip Technologies.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nIt's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nby taking the aggregate of these signals\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nin the hospital, in the intensive care unit,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nand putting it on a smartphone for physicians.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nIf you're an expectant parent,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nwhat about the ability to monitor, continuously,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nfetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand not having to worry so much that things are\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nfine as the pregnancy,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand moving over into the time of delivery?\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd then as we go further,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ntoday we have continuous glucose sensors.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nRight now, they are under the skin,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nbut in the future, they won't have to be implanted.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nbetween 75 and less than 200,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nchecking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nyou'll see how that can impact diabetes.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd what about sleep?\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nWe're going to zoom in on that a little bit.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nWe're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nWhat if, on your phone,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nwhich will be available in the next few weeks,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nyou had every minute of your sleep displayed?\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThe REM sleep, rapid eye movement,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\ndream state, is in light green;\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nand light is gray, light sleep;\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nis that dark green.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nHow about counting every calorie?\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd this is ability, in real time, to actually take\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nmeasurements of caloric intake\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nas well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nNow, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nBut what I want to get to, the next frontier,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nvery quickly, and why the stethoscope\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nis on its way out,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nis because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand the breath sounds, because now,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nintroduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWhy is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nHere is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nand also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSo, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics --\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nthe key measurements of vital signs,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nthat one could look at in your smartphone.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nNow, this is an example of another obsolete technology,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nsoon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nTwenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nThis is now a little tiny patch.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nYou can put it on for two weeks\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand send it in the mail.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nNow, how does this work? Well,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nthere is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nthat one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd this sends a signal\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand it creates a body area network to a gateway.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nGateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nas today many of these things are dedicated gateways,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbecause they are not so well integrated.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nThat signal goes to the web, the cloud,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand then it can be processed and sent anywhere:\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nto a caregiver, to a physician,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nback to the patient, etc.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nSo, that's basically very simplistic technology\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nof how this works.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nNow, I have this device on.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nI didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThis is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nas you saw already,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nbut it also goes well beyond that.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis is me now. And you can see the ECG.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nBelow that's the actual heart rate and the trend;\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nto the right of that is a bioconductant.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThat's the fluid status,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nfluid status, that's really important\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nif you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd below that's temperature,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand respiration, and oxygen,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nand then the position activity.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo, this is really striking, because this device\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nmeasures seven things\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthat are very much vital signs\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfor monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd why is this important? Well,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nthis is the most expensive bed.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nWhat if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nWell, we can. First of all, heart failure\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nis the number one reason\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nfor hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nThe cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nwhich is 80 percent related to hospitalization.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nfor a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nis -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nSo, can we improve that? Well the idea is\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwe take this device that I'm wearing,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nrandomly assigned, versus 600 patients\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwho don't have active monitoring,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nbut that's a type of wireless device trial\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat could change medicine in the years ahead.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWhy now? Why has this all of a sudden become\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\na reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nWhat we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nThis sets up consumer-driven healthcare.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThat's where this is all starting.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nLet me just give you specifics about why this is\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\na big movement if you're not aware of it:\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\n1.2 million Americans\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nhave gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthat connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd this Wired Magazine cover article\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nreally captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nand how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand energy expenditure.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nHere are some things, the principles\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthat are guiding principles to keep in mind:\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\n\"A data-driven health revolution\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\npromises to make us all\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nbetter, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers.\"\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd this one, which is really telling,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthis was from July, this cover article:\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n\"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\ndiet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nof life, from sleep to mood to pain,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\n24/7/365.\"\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nWell, I tried this device.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nA lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nI didn't have one of those,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nbut I got the Fitbit.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThat looks like this.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nIt's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAnd I want to just give you the results of that testing,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nbecause I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nI hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nI hope so.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nBut this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nHowever you have to put in most of this stuff.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThe only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nand even then, it's not complete.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSo, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nYou put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nand of course it tells you how many calories you're expending\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nfrom the exercise, and how many you took in,\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nif you go in and enter all the foods.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nBut it really wants you to enter all your activity.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd so I went to this,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nand of course I was gratified that it picked up\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthe 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nbut then it wants more information.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nSo, it says, \"You want to log sexual activity.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nHow long did you do it for?\"\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd it says, \"How hard was it?\"\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nFurthermore it says, \"Start time.\"\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nNow, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nI mean, this just doesn't work.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo, now I want to move to sleep.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nWho would ever have thought you could have your own EEG\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nat your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThis is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nIt monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo, I did this thing for seven days\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\ngetting ready for TEDMed.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nThis is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nOf course how many here\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nhave any problems with sleeping?\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nIt's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nOkay, well this was a week of\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nmy life in sleeping,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nand you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nyou get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nYou say, \"Oh, OK.\" And a Z.Q. score\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nis adjusted to age,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand you want to get as high as you possibly can.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo this is the moment-by-moment,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nor minute-by-minute sleep.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd the wake time is in orange.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd this can be a problem, as I learned.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nBecause it not only helps you with quantifying\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nyour sleep,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nbut also tells others you're awake.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nSo, when my wife came in and she\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\ncould tell you're awake.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\n\"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd I'm trying to play possum.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThis thing is very, very impressive.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nOK. So, that's the first night.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd this one is now 67,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand that's not a good score.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nAnd this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nin deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nThis was really fascinating because\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthis gave that quantitation\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nabout all the different phases of sleep.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nSo, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nIt's like a managed competition of sleep.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd really interesting stuff.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nLook at this thing and say, \"Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbut actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds.\" OK?\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd the key thing was, what I didn't know,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nwas that I was a really good dreamer.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nOK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nEighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nor 80 percent of age greater than 65 have\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\ntwo or more chronic disease,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\n140 million Americans\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nhave one or more chronic disease,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nexpenditures are related to chronic disease.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nNow, diabetes is one of the big ones.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAlmost 24 million people have diabetes.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nAnd here is the latest map. It was published\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\njust a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nand it isn't looking good.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nThat is, for men, 29 percent\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nin the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand women, although it's less, it's terribly high.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nBut of course we have a way to measure that now\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\non a continuous basis,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nwith a sensor that detects blood glucose,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nand it's important because we could detect\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nhyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand also hypoglycemia.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwere finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nBut by continuous monitoring,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nit captures all that vital information.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe future of this though,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nis being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand that's not so far away.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo, let me just give you, very quickly,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\n10 top targets for wireless medicine.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAll these things are possible --\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nsome of them are very close,\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nor already, as you heard,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nare available today, in some way or form.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAlzheimer's disease:\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nthere's five million people affected, and you can check\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nvital signs, activity, balance.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAsthma: large number, we could detect things like\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\npollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nI'll show you an example of that real quickly.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nDepression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nDiabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\n74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nto come up with much better management and prevention.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd sleep disorders.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThis is effective around the world. The access to smartphones\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand cell phones today is extraordinary.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nabout the opportunities in health across the developing world:\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\n\"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nmore quickly, than any previous technology.\"\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnd that's before we got going on the m-health world.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAging: The problem is enormous,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n300,000 broken hips per year;\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nbut the solutions are extraordinary,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nand they include so many different things.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nOne of the ones I just wanted to mention:\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nThe iShoe is another example of a sensor that\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nimproves proprioception among the elderly\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nto prevent falling.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nOne of many different techniques using wireless sensors.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nSo, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nacross the ages from premies or unborn children\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nto seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nthe full spectrum of disease -- I hope I've given you a sense of that --\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nacross the globe.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThere are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nOne of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nand that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nto get behind this wireless health institute.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nSan Diego is an extraordinary place for this.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nThere's over 650 wireless companies,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n100 of which or more are working in wireless health.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nIt's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nit dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nThe wireless institute,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthe West Wireless Health Institute,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nis really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nwho are here this evening:\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nGary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nTheir fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nand this is really a nonprofit education center\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nwhich is just about to open. It looks like this,\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nthis whole building dedicated.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nto take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate --\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nit was announced on Monday --\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nthen to move up with development,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nclinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nthe most challenging thing of all,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nrequiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nThe other big thing, besides having this fantastic\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ninstitute to catalyze this process\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nis guidance,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nand that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nIf we understand biology from genomics and omics\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBecause what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nOver 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nbut this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nthe underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nthan in the history of man.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nAnd when you put that together with, for example,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nnow an app for the iPhone with your genotype\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nto guide drug therapy ...\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nbut, the future -- we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nfrom all the common variants,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand that's going to get filled in more\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nwith low-frequency variants in the future.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nWe can tell who's going to get breast cancer\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nfrom the various genes.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nWe can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nEach of these has a sensor.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nWe can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nWe can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nfor breast cancer with an ultrasound device\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\ngiven to the patient.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nAn iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nAnd vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWe lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nSo, I hope I've convinced you of this,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nof the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nand then the impact on diseases is equally impressive\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nacross all these different diseases and more.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nIt's really taking individualized medicine to a new height\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand it's hyper-innovative,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand I think it represents the black swan of medicine.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThanks for your attention.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The world needs all kinds of minds", "duration": "1183", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/temple_grandin_the_world_needs_all_kinds_of_minds", "transcript": "I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. Autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe \u2014 the child remains nonverbal \u2014 all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers. And I actually feel at home here, because there's a lot of autism genetics here.(Laughter)You wouldn't have any \u2014(Applause)It's a continuum of traits. When does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism? I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today. And one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the ones that are going to invent the next energy things that Bill Gates talked about this morning.OK, now, if you want to understand autism: animals. I want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking. You have to get away from verbal language. I think in pictures. I don't think in language. Now, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details. This is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters or the little letters, and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details. Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important because it'll fall down if you ignore the details. And one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract. People are getting away from doing hands-on stuff. I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands-on classes, because art, and classes like that \u2014 those are the classes where I excelled.In my work with cattle, I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice would make the cattle balk. For example, this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility. This feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility; all they needed to do was move the flag. Rapid movement, contrast. In the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes to see what cattle were seeing. People thought that was crazy. A coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk, a hose on the floor \u2014 people weren't noticing these things. A chain hanging down ... And that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.In fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side. My drawings got to star in the movie, too. And, actually, it's called \"Temple Grandin,\" not \"Thinking in Pictures.\"So what is thinking in pictures? It's literally movies in your head. My mind works like Google for images. When I was a young kid, I didn't know my thinking was different. I thought everybody thought in pictures. Then when I did my book, \"Thinking in Pictures,\" I started interviewing people about how they think. And I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different. Like if I say, \"Think about a church steeple,\" most people get this sort of generalized generic one. Now, maybe that's not true in this room, but it's going to be true in a lot of different places. I see only specific pictures. They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures. And in the movie, they've got a great scene in there, where the word \"shoe\" is said, and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes pop into my imagination.OK, there's my childhood church; that's specific. There's some more, Fort Collins. OK, how about famous ones? And they just kind of come up, kind of like this. Just really quickly, like Google for pictures. And they come up one at a time, and then I think, \"OK, well, maybe we can have it snow, or we can have a thunderstorm,\" and I can hold it there and turn them into videos.Now, visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing cattle-handling facilities. And I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant. I'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides. I've got that stuff up on YouTube, if you want to look at it.(Laughter)But one of the things that I was able to do in my design work is I could test-run a piece of equipment in my mind, just like a virtual reality computer system. And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie. That was like just so super cool. And there were a lot of, kind of, Asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set, too.(Laughter)But one of the things that really worries me is: Where's the younger version of those kids going today? They're not ending up in Silicon Valley, where they belong.(Laughter)(Applause)One of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social, is I had to sell my work, and not myself. And the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings, I showed off pictures of things. Another thing that helped me as a little kid is, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners. You were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around.When kids get to be in third or fourth grade, you might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker, drawing in perspective. Now, I want to emphasize that not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker. Now, I had this brain scan done several years ago, and I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex. This is tensor imaging. And my great big Internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's. The red lines there are me, and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control. And there I got a gigantic one, and the control over there, the blue one, has got a really small one.And some of the research now is showing that people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex. Now, the thing is, the visual thinker is just one kind of mind. You see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind \u2014 good at one thing, bad at something else. And where I was bad was algebra. And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig. Gigantic mistake. I'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra, go right to geometry and trig.Now, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker. More abstract. These are your engineers, your computer programmers. This is pattern thinking. That praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper \u2014 no scotch tape, no cuts. And there in the background is the pattern for folding it. Here are the types of thinking: photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me; pattern thinkers, music and math minds. Some of these oftentimes have problems with reading. You also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic. You'll see these different kinds of minds. And then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.Now, another thing is the sensory issues. I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face. And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it, and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin. But sensory is an issue. Some kids are bothered by fluorescent lights; others have problems with sound sensitivity. You know, it's going to be variable.Now, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind. Because think about it: an animal is a sensory-based thinker, not verbal \u2014 thinks in pictures, thinks in sounds, thinks in smells. Think about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant. He knows who's been there \u2014(Laughter)When they were there. Are they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with? There's a ton of information on that fire hydrant. It's all very detailed information. And looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals.Now, the animal mind, and also my mind, puts sensory-based information into categories. Man on a horse, and a man on the ground \u2014 that is viewed as two totally different things. You could have a horse that's been abused by a rider. They'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him. You have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up, and he'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian, but a person can ride him. Cattle are the same way. Man on a horse, a man on foot \u2014 they're two different things. You see, it's a different picture. See, I want you to think about just how specific this is.Now, this ability to put information into categories, I find a lot of people are not very good at this. When I'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant, they don't seem to be able to figure out: \"Do I have a training-people issue? Or do I have something wrong with the equipment?\" In other words, categorize equipment problem from a people problem. I find a lot of people have difficulty doing that. Now, let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem. Is it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix? Or is the whole design of the system wrong? People have a hard time figuring that out.Let's just look at something like, you know, solving problems with making airlines safer. Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier. I do lots and lots of flying, and if I was at the FAA, what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of? It would be their airplane tails. You know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years, the tail either came off, or steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way. It's tails, pure and simple. And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what? They can't see that stuff inside the tail. Now as I think about that, I'm pulling up all of that specific information. It's specific. See, my thinking's bottom-up. I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.Now, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats. He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat. White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine. Now, the thing is, the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to work together. We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds. And one of the things that is driving me really crazy as I travel around and I do autism meetings, is I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids, and they just aren't very social, and nobody's working on developing their interest in something like science.And this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher. My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie. I was a goofball student when I was in high school. I just didn't care at all about studying, until I had Mr. Carlock's science class. He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie. And he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room. This brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids interesting stuff. You know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED, and there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet to get these kids turned on. Because I'm seeing a lot of these geeky, nerdy kids, and the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country when you get away from these tech areas, they don't know what to do with these kids. And they're not going down the right path.The thing is, you can make a mind to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind, or your mind can be wired to be more social. And what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back here in the really brilliant mind, and we lose a few social circuits here. It's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social. And then you can get to the point where it's so severe, you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal. In the normal human mind, language covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller. He studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia. And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain. And then this artwork came out of somebody who used to install stereos in cars. Now, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics, but I think it's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model of turbulence, which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head.And the Wolfram stuff \u2014 I was taking notes and writing down all the search words I could use, because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures. We've got to show these kids interesting stuff. And they've taken out the auto-shop class and the drafting class and the art class. I mean, art was my best subject in school.We've got to think about all these different kinds of minds, and we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds, because we absolutely are going to need these kinds of people in the future. And let's talk about jobs. OK, my science teacher got me studying, because I was a goofball that didn't want to study. But you know what? I was getting work experience. I'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things, like how to be on time \u2014 I was taught that when I was eight years old. How to have table manners at granny's Sunday party. I was taught that when I was very, very young. And when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes. I did internships in college, I was building things, and I also had to learn how to do assignments.You know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little. My mother said, \"Well let's do a picture of something else.\" They've got to learn how to do something else. Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos. Let's get him working on building different things. The thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated. Like if the kid loves race cars, let's use race cars for math. Let's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance. In other words, use that fixation in order to motivate that kid, that's one of the things we need to do. I really get fed up when the teachers, especially when you get away from this part of the country, they don't know what to do with these smart kids. It just drives me crazy.What can visual thinkers do when they grow up? They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers, photography, industrial design. The pattern thinkers \u2014 they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians, your software engineers, your computer programmers, all of those kinds of jobs. And then you've got the word minds; they make great journalists, and they also make really, really good stage actors. Because the thing about being autistic is, I had to learn social skills like being in a play. You just kind of ... you just have to learn it.And we need to be working with these students. And this brings up mentors. You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher. He was a NASA space scientist. Some states now are getting it to where, if you have a degree in biology or in chemistry, you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry. We need to be doing that. Because what I'm observing is, the good teachers, for a lot of these kids, are out in the community colleges. But we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools.Another thing that can be very, very, very successful is: there's a lot of people that may have retired from working in the software industry, and they can teach your kid. And it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old, because what you're doing is you're lighting the spark. You're getting that kid turned on. And you get him turned on, then you'll learn all the new stuff. Mentors are just essential. I cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me. And we've got to mentor them, hire them.And if you bring them in for internships in your companies, the thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind, you've got to give them a specific task. Don't just say, \"Design new software.\" You've got to tell them something more specific: \"We're designing software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing, and it can only use so much memory.\" That's the kind of specificity you need.Well, that's the end of my talk. And I just want to thank everybody for coming. It was great to be here.(Applause) (Applause ends)Oh \u2014 you have a question for me? OK.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank you so much for that. You know, you once wrote \u2014 I like this quote: \"If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth, then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave.\"(Laughter)Temple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spear? It was the Asperger guy, and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics, there'd be no more Silicon Valley, and the energy crisis would not be solved.(Applause)CA: I want to ask you a couple other questions, and if any of these feel inappropriate, it's OK just to say, \"Next question.\" But if there is someone here who has an autistic child, or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them, what advice would you give them?TG: Well, first of all, we've got to look at age. If you have a two, three or four-year-old, no speech, no social interaction, I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait. You need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching. The thing is, autism comes in different degrees. About half of the people on the spectrum are not going to learn to talk, and they won't be working in Silicon Valley. That would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.But then you get these smart, geeky kids with a touch of autism, and that's where you've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things. I got social interaction through shared interests \u2014 I rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids, did electronics lab with other kids. And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show. That was, like, we considered that super cool.(Laughter)CA: Is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them, as some might, as most, wish?TG: Well, I tell you, that child will be loyal, and if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it.CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them what they're most passionate about, they'd say things like, \"My kids\" or \"My lover.\" What are you most passionate about?TG: I'm passionate about that the things I do are going to make the world a better place. When I have a mother of an autistic child say, \"My kid went to college because of your book or one of your lectures,\" that makes me happy.You know, the slaughter plants I worked with in the '80s; they were absolutely awful. I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants, where you just measure outcomes: How many cattle fell down? How many got poked with the prodder? How many cattle are mooing their heads off? And it's very, very simple. You directly observe a few simple things. It's worked really well. I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world. We need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff.CA: Totally.(Applause)CA: When we were talking on the phone, one of the things you said that really astonished me was that one thing you were passionate about was server farms. Tell me about that.TG: Well, the reason why I got really excited when I read about that, it contains knowledge. It's libraries. And to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable. So, maybe over 10 years ago now, our library got flooded. This is before the Internet got really big. And I was really upset about all the books being wrecked, because it was knowledge being destroyed. And server farms, or data centers, are great libraries of knowledge.CA: Temple, can I just say, it's an absolute delight to have you at TED. Thank you so much.TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 773, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:14.848\nI think I'll start out\nand just talk a little bit\n\n00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:16.363\nabout what exactly autism is.\n\n00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:19.022\nAutism is a very big continuum\n\n00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:22.220\nthat goes from very severe --\nthe child remains nonverbal --\n\n00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:24.934\nall the way up to brilliant\nscientists and engineers.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.935\nAnd I actually feel at home here,\n\n00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.505\nbecause there's a lot\nof autism genetics here.\n\n00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.561\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:31.743\nYou wouldn't have any --\n\n00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:34.736\n(Applause)\n\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.796\nIt's a continuum of traits.\n\n00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.477\nWhen does a nerd turn into Asperger,\nwhich is just mild autism?\n\n00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:47.659\nI mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla\nwould all be probably diagnosed\n\n00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:49.575\nas autistic spectrum today.\n\n00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:52.890\nAnd one of the things\nthat is really going to concern me\n\n00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:55.149\nis getting these kids to be the ones\n\n00:00:55.173 --> 00:00:57.995\nthat are going to invent\nthe next energy things\n\n00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.269\nthat Bill Gates talked about this morning.\n\n00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:04.669\nOK, now, if you want\nto understand autism: animals.\n\n00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:07.583\nI want to talk to you now\nabout different ways of thinking.\n\n00:01:07.607 --> 00:01:10.457\nYou have to get away from verbal language.\n\n00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:14.082\nI think in pictures.\nI don't think in language.\n\n00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.050\nNow, the thing about the autistic mind\nis it attends to details.\n\n00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:23.129\nThis is a test where you either\nhave to pick out the big letters\n\n00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:24.376\nor the little letters,\n\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.293\nand the autistic mind picks out\nthe little letters more quickly.\n\n00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:32.396\nAnd the thing is, the normal brain\nignores the details.\n\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.430\nWell, if you're building a bridge,\ndetails are pretty important\n\n00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:37.852\nbecause it'll fall down\nif you ignore the details.\n\n00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:40.743\nAnd one of my big concerns\nwith a lot of policy things today\n\n00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.445\nis things are getting too abstract.\n\n00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.696\nPeople are getting away\nfrom doing hands-on stuff.\n\n00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.880\nI'm really concerned\nthat a lot of the schools\n\n00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:51.872\nhave taken out the hands-on classes,\nbecause art, and classes like that --\n\n00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:54.209\nthose are the classes where I excelled.\n\n00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:56.387\nIn my work with cattle,\n\n00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:59.389\nI noticed a lot of little things\nthat most people don't notice\n\n00:01:59.413 --> 00:02:00.701\nwould make the cattle balk.\n\n00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:04.272\nFor example, this flag waving\nright in front of the veterinary facility.\n\n00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:07.623\nThis feed yard was going to tear down\ntheir whole veterinary facility;\n\n00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:09.561\nall they needed to do was move the flag.\n\n00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:11.653\nRapid movement, contrast.\n\n00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:14.711\nIn the early '70s when I started,\nI got right down in the chutes\n\n00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.234\nto see what cattle were seeing.\n\n00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:17.720\nPeople thought that was crazy.\n\n00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:21.026\nA coat on a fence would make them balk,\nshadows would make them balk,\n\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.114\na hose on the floor --\npeople weren't noticing these things.\n\n00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:25.654\nA chain hanging down ...\n\n00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:27.934\nAnd that's shown\nvery, very nicely in the movie.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.413\nIn fact, I loved the movie,\nhow they duplicated all my projects.\n\n00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:32.778\nThat's the geek side.\n\n00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:35.222\nMy drawings got to star in the movie, too.\n\n00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.356\nAnd, actually, it's called\n\"Temple Grandin,\"\n\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.704\nnot \"Thinking in Pictures.\"\n\n00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:40.293\nSo what is thinking in pictures?\n\n00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:42.996\nIt's literally movies in your head.\n\n00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.902\nMy mind works like Google for images.\n\n00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:48.970\nWhen I was a young kid,\nI didn't know my thinking was different.\n\n00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:50.913\nI thought everybody thought in pictures.\n\n00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.192\nThen when I did my book,\n\"Thinking in Pictures,\"\n\n00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:55.628\nI started interviewing people\nabout how they think.\n\n00:02:55.652 --> 00:02:58.807\nAnd I was shocked to find out\nthat my thinking was quite different.\n\n00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:01.007\nLike if I say, \"Think\nabout a church steeple,\"\n\n00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:03.544\nmost people get this sort\nof generalized generic one.\n\n00:03:03.568 --> 00:03:05.480\nNow, maybe that's not true in this room,\n\n00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:08.770\nbut it's going to be true\nin a lot of different places.\n\n00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:11.297\nI see only specific pictures.\n\n00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.130\nThey flash up into my memory,\njust like Google for pictures.\n\n00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:17.697\nAnd in the movie,\nthey've got a great scene in there,\n\n00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:21.521\nwhere the word \"shoe\" is said,\nand a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes\n\n00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.211\npop into my imagination.\n\n00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:26.117\nOK, there's my childhood church;\nthat's specific.\n\n00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.373\nThere's some more, Fort Collins.\n\n00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:30.444\nOK, how about famous ones?\n\n00:03:30.468 --> 00:03:33.145\nAnd they just kind of come up,\nkind of like this.\n\n00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.080\nJust really quickly,\nlike Google for pictures.\n\n00:03:36.104 --> 00:03:37.663\nAnd they come up one at a time,\n\n00:03:37.687 --> 00:03:40.638\nand then I think, \"OK, well,\nmaybe we can have it snow,\n\n00:03:40.662 --> 00:03:42.286\nor we can have a thunderstorm,\"\n\n00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.934\nand I can hold it there\nand turn them into videos.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.171\nNow, visual thinking\nwas a tremendous asset\n\n00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:50.997\nin my work designing\ncattle-handling facilities.\n\n00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.697\nAnd I've worked really hard\non improving how cattle are treated\n\n00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:55.873\nat the slaughter plant.\n\n00:03:55.897 --> 00:03:58.393\nI'm not going to go\ninto any gucky slaughter slides.\n\n00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:01.305\nI've got that stuff up on YouTube,\nif you want to look at it.\n\n00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.370\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:02.394 --> 00:04:05.287\nBut one of the things\nthat I was able to do in my design work\n\n00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.934\nis I could test-run a piece\nof equipment in my mind,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.390\njust like a virtual reality\ncomputer system.\n\n00:04:11.406 --> 00:04:15.047\nAnd this is an aerial view\nof a recreation of one of my projects\n\n00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.433\nthat was used in the movie.\n\n00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:18.468\nThat was like just so super cool.\n\n00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:21.970\nAnd there were a lot of, kind of,\nAsperger types and autism types\n\n00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.942\nworking out there on the movie set, too.\n\n00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:25.142\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:27.957\nBut one of the things\nthat really worries me is:\n\n00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:30.985\nWhere's the younger version\nof those kids going today?\n\n00:04:31.518 --> 00:04:33.973\nThey're not ending up in Silicon Valley,\n\n00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:35.237\nwhere they belong.\n\n00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.081\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:42.013\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:45.618\nOne of the things I learned very early on\nbecause I wasn't that social,\n\n00:04:45.642 --> 00:04:49.053\nis I had to sell my work, and not myself.\n\n00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:52.364\nAnd the way I sold livestock jobs\nis I showed off my drawings,\n\n00:04:52.388 --> 00:04:54.120\nI showed off pictures of things.\n\n00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:56.383\nAnother thing that helped me\nas a little kid\n\n00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:58.636\nis, boy, in the '50s,\nyou were taught manners.\n\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.699\nYou were taught you can't pull\nthe merchandise off the shelves\n\n00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:03.357\nin the store and throw it around.\n\n00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:05.533\nWhen kids get to be\nin third or fourth grade,\n\n00:05:05.557 --> 00:05:08.385\nyou might see that this kid's going\nto be a visual thinker,\n\n00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.674\ndrawing in perspective.\n\n00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:10.896\nNow, I want to emphasize\n\n00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.843\nthat not every autistic kid\nis going to be a visual thinker.\n\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.388\nNow, I had this brain scan\ndone several years ago,\n\n00:05:18.412 --> 00:05:22.345\nand I used to joke around about having\na gigantic Internet trunk line\n\n00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:24.296\ngoing deep into my visual cortex.\n\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.195\nThis is tensor imaging.\n\n00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.071\nAnd my great big Internet trunk line\nis twice as big as the control's.\n\n00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:31.699\nThe red lines there are me,\n\n00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:35.632\nand the blue lines are the sex\nand age-matched control.\n\n00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:38.570\nAnd there I got a gigantic one,\n\n00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:42.602\nand the control over there, the blue one,\nhas got a really small one.\n\n00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:45.934\nAnd some of the research now is showing\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.989\nthat people on the spectrum actually\nthink with the primary visual cortex.\n\n00:05:50.013 --> 00:05:53.054\nNow, the thing is, the visual thinker\nis just one kind of mind.\n\n00:05:53.078 --> 00:05:56.663\nYou see, the autistic mind\ntends to be a specialist mind --\n\n00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:59.300\ngood at one thing, bad at something else.\n\n00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.554\nAnd where I was bad was algebra.\n\n00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:03.868\nAnd I was never allowed\nto take geometry or trig.\n\n00:06:03.892 --> 00:06:05.055\nGigantic mistake.\n\n00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:07.514\nI'm finding a lot of kids\nwho need to skip algebra,\n\n00:06:07.538 --> 00:06:09.187\ngo right to geometry and trig.\n\n00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:12.145\nNow, another kind of mind\nis the pattern thinker.\n\n00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.408\nMore abstract.\n\n00:06:13.432 --> 00:06:15.995\nThese are your engineers,\nyour computer programmers.\n\n00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:17.413\nThis is pattern thinking.\n\n00:06:17.437 --> 00:06:20.322\nThat praying mantis is made\nfrom a single sheet of paper --\n\n00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:21.763\nno scotch tape, no cuts.\n\n00:06:21.787 --> 00:06:25.322\nAnd there in the background\nis the pattern for folding it.\n\n00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:26.991\nHere are the types of thinking:\n\n00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:29.981\nphoto-realistic visual thinkers, like me;\n\n00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:33.934\npattern thinkers, music and math minds.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.546\nSome of these oftentimes\nhave problems with reading.\n\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.051\nYou also will see these kind of problems\nwith kids that are dyslexic.\n\n00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:43.099\nYou'll see these different kinds of minds.\n\n00:06:43.123 --> 00:06:46.697\nAnd then there's a verbal mind,\nthey know every fact about everything.\n\n00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:48.687\nNow, another thing is the sensory issues.\n\n00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:52.003\nI was really concerned about having\nto wear this gadget on my face.\n\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.544\nAnd I came in half an hour beforehand\n\n00:06:54.568 --> 00:06:57.551\nso I could have it put on\nand kind of get used to it,\n\n00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:00.313\nand they got it bent\nso it's not hitting my chin.\n\n00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.489\nBut sensory is an issue.\n\n00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:03.662\nSome kids are bothered\nby fluorescent lights;\n\n00:07:03.686 --> 00:07:05.843\nothers have problems\nwith sound sensitivity.\n\n00:07:06.195 --> 00:07:08.368\nYou know, it's going to be variable.\n\n00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.770\nNow, visual thinking gave me\na whole lot of insight\n\n00:07:12.794 --> 00:07:15.054\ninto the animal mind.\n\n00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:18.511\nBecause think about it:\nan animal is a sensory-based thinker,\n\n00:07:18.535 --> 00:07:24.732\nnot verbal -- thinks in pictures,\nthinks in sounds, thinks in smells.\n\n00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:28.100\nThink about how much information\nthere is on the local fire hydrant.\n\n00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:29.486\nHe knows who's been there --\n\n00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.541\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:31.722\nWhen they were there.\n\n00:07:31.746 --> 00:07:34.641\nAre they friend or foe?\nIs there anybody he can go mate with?\n\n00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:37.547\nThere's a ton of information\non that fire hydrant.\n\n00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:40.357\nIt's all very detailed information.\n\n00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:44.933\nAnd looking at these kind of details\ngave me a lot of insight into animals.\n\n00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:48.934\nNow, the animal mind, and also my mind,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:53.527\nputs sensory-based information\ninto categories.\n\n00:07:53.551 --> 00:07:55.254\nMan on a horse,\n\n00:07:55.278 --> 00:07:56.833\nand a man on the ground --\n\n00:07:56.857 --> 00:07:59.642\nthat is viewed as two\ntotally different things.\n\n00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.165\nYou could have a horse\nthat's been abused by a rider.\n\n00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:04.459\nThey'll be absolutely fine\nwith the veterinarian\n\n00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.934\nand with the horseshoer,\nbut you can't ride him.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.133\nYou have another horse,\nwhere maybe the horseshoer beat him up,\n\n00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:14.152\nand he'll be terrible for anything\non the ground with the veterinarian,\n\n00:08:14.176 --> 00:08:16.191\nbut a person can ride him.\n\n00:08:16.215 --> 00:08:17.522\nCattle are the same way.\n\n00:08:17.546 --> 00:08:21.471\nMan on a horse, a man on foot --\nthey're two different things.\n\n00:08:21.495 --> 00:08:23.451\nYou see, it's a different picture.\n\n00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:26.596\nSee, I want you to think\nabout just how specific this is.\n\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.007\nNow, this ability to put\ninformation into categories,\n\n00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:33.383\nI find a lot of people\nare not very good at this.\n\n00:08:33.407 --> 00:08:35.575\nWhen I'm out troubleshooting equipment\n\n00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.427\nor problems with something in a plant,\n\n00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.456\nthey don't seem to be able to figure out:\n\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.180\n\"Do I have a training-people issue?\n\n00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:43.639\nOr do I have something wrong\nwith the equipment?\"\n\n00:08:43.663 --> 00:08:47.357\nIn other words, categorize\nequipment problem from a people problem.\n\n00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:50.477\nI find a lot of people\nhave difficulty doing that.\n\n00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:53.065\nNow, let's say I figure out\nit's an equipment problem.\n\n00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:55.865\nIs it a minor problem,\nwith something simple I can fix?\n\n00:08:55.889 --> 00:08:58.204\nOr is the whole design\nof the system wrong?\n\n00:08:58.228 --> 00:09:00.934\nPeople have a hard time figuring that out.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.054\nLet's just look at something\nlike, you know,\n\n00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:05.324\nsolving problems with making\nairlines safer.\n\n00:09:05.348 --> 00:09:06.934\nYeah, I'm a million-mile flier.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.784\nI do lots and lots of flying,\n\n00:09:08.808 --> 00:09:12.040\nand if I was at the FAA,\n\n00:09:12.064 --> 00:09:15.586\nwhat would I be doing a lot\nof direct observation of?\n\n00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:18.459\nIt would be their airplane tails.\n\n00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:21.033\nYou know, five fatal wrecks\nin the last 20 years,\n\n00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:22.832\nthe tail either came off,\n\n00:09:22.856 --> 00:09:26.290\nor steering stuff inside the tail\nbroke in some way.\n\n00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:28.758\nIt's tails, pure and simple.\n\n00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:31.315\nAnd when the pilots walk\naround the plane, guess what?\n\n00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:33.390\nThey can't see that stuff inside the tail.\n\n00:09:33.414 --> 00:09:34.851\nNow as I think about that,\n\n00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:38.334\nI'm pulling up all of that\nspecific information.\n\n00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:39.531\nIt's specific.\n\n00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:41.050\nSee, my thinking's bottom-up.\n\n00:09:41.074 --> 00:09:44.771\nI take all the little pieces and I put\nthe pieces together like a puzzle.\n\n00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:48.562\nNow, here is a horse that was deathly\nafraid of black cowboy hats.\n\n00:09:48.586 --> 00:09:51.146\nHe'd been abused by somebody\nwith a black cowboy hat.\n\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.059\nWhite cowboy hats,\nthat was absolutely fine.\n\n00:09:54.554 --> 00:09:57.104\nNow, the thing is,\nthe world is going to need\n\n00:09:57.128 --> 00:10:01.217\nall of the different kinds of minds\nto work together.\n\n00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:04.432\nWe've got to work on developing\nall these different kinds of minds.\n\n00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:06.998\nAnd one of the things\nthat is driving me really crazy\n\n00:10:07.022 --> 00:10:09.369\nas I travel around\nand I do autism meetings,\n\n00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:12.534\nis I'm seeing a lot of smart,\ngeeky, nerdy kids,\n\n00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:14.733\nand they just aren't very social,\n\n00:10:14.757 --> 00:10:17.848\nand nobody's working\non developing their interest\n\n00:10:17.872 --> 00:10:19.247\nin something like science.\n\n00:10:19.624 --> 00:10:22.311\nAnd this brings up the whole thing\nof my science teacher.\n\n00:10:22.335 --> 00:10:25.443\nMy science teacher is shown\nabsolutely beautifully in the movie.\n\n00:10:25.467 --> 00:10:27.953\nI was a goofball student\nwhen I was in high school.\n\n00:10:27.977 --> 00:10:30.005\nI just didn't care at all about studying,\n\n00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:33.258\nuntil I had Mr. Carlock's science class.\n\n00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:35.654\nHe was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.\n\n00:10:36.055 --> 00:10:41.934\nAnd he got me challenged\nto figure out an optical illusion room.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.673\nThis brings up the whole thing\nof you've got to show kids\n\n00:10:44.697 --> 00:10:45.854\ninteresting stuff.\n\n00:10:46.272 --> 00:10:49.585\nYou know, one of the things\nthat I think maybe TED ought to do\n\n00:10:49.609 --> 00:10:52.924\nis tell all the schools about all\nthe great lectures that are on TED,\n\n00:10:52.948 --> 00:10:55.435\nand there's all kinds\nof great stuff on the Internet\n\n00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:56.831\nto get these kids turned on.\n\n00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:59.341\nBecause I'm seeing a lot\nof these geeky, nerdy kids,\n\n00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:02.549\nand the teachers out in the Midwest\nand other parts of the country\n\n00:11:02.573 --> 00:11:04.511\nwhen you get away from these tech areas,\n\n00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:06.547\nthey don't know what to do\nwith these kids.\n\n00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:08.592\nAnd they're not going down the right path.\n\n00:11:08.616 --> 00:11:10.398\nThe thing is, you can make a mind\n\n00:11:10.422 --> 00:11:13.147\nto be more of a thinking\nand cognitive mind,\n\n00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:15.646\nor your mind can be wired\nto be more social.\n\n00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.301\nAnd what some of the research\nnow has shown in autism\n\n00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:21.795\nis there may by extra wiring back here\nin the really brilliant mind,\n\n00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:23.732\nand we lose a few social circuits here.\n\n00:11:23.756 --> 00:11:26.707\nIt's kind of a trade-off\nbetween thinking and social.\n\n00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:29.323\nAnd then you can get to the point\nwhere it's so severe,\n\n00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:32.203\nyou're going to have a person\nthat's going to be non-verbal.\n\n00:11:32.227 --> 00:11:33.934\nIn the normal human mind,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.580\nlanguage covers up the visual thinking\nwe share with animals.\n\n00:11:37.604 --> 00:11:40.295\nThis is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.\n\n00:11:41.454 --> 00:11:45.186\nHe studied Alzheimer's patients\nthat had frontal temporal lobe dementia.\n\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.233\nAnd the dementia ate out\nthe language parts of the brain.\n\n00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:50.528\nAnd then this artwork came out of somebody\n\n00:11:50.552 --> 00:11:52.520\nwho used to install stereos in cars.\n\n00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:57.191\nNow, Van Gogh doesn't know\nanything about physics,\n\n00:11:57.215 --> 00:12:00.536\nbut I think it's very interesting\nthat there was some work done\n\n00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.283\nto show that this eddy pattern\nin this painting\n\n00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:06.455\nfollowed a statistical model\nof turbulence,\n\n00:12:06.479 --> 00:12:08.498\nwhich brings up the whole interesting idea\n\n00:12:08.522 --> 00:12:12.260\nof maybe some of this mathematical\npatterns is in our own head.\n\n00:12:12.284 --> 00:12:13.837\nAnd the Wolfram stuff --\n\n00:12:13.861 --> 00:12:18.427\nI was taking notes and writing down\nall the search words I could use,\n\n00:12:18.451 --> 00:12:21.778\nbecause I think that's going to go on\nin my autism lectures.\n\n00:12:21.802 --> 00:12:24.229\nWe've got to show\nthese kids interesting stuff.\n\n00:12:24.253 --> 00:12:26.520\nAnd they've taken out the auto-shop class\n\n00:12:26.544 --> 00:12:28.644\nand the drafting class and the art class.\n\n00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.934\nI mean, art was my best subject in school.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.817\nWe've got to think about all\nthese different kinds of minds,\n\n00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:36.621\nand we've got to absolutely\nwork with these kind of minds,\n\n00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:38.933\nbecause we absolutely are going to need\n\n00:12:38.957 --> 00:12:41.478\nthese kinds of people in the future.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.737\nAnd let's talk about jobs.\n\n00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:46.415\nOK, my science teacher got me studying,\n\n00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:48.853\nbecause I was a goofball\nthat didn't want to study.\n\n00:12:48.877 --> 00:12:51.222\nBut you know what?\nI was getting work experience.\n\n00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:54.710\nI'm seeing too many of these smart kids\nwho haven't learned basic things,\n\n00:12:54.734 --> 00:12:58.182\nlike how to be on time -- I was taught\nthat when I was eight years old.\n\n00:12:58.206 --> 00:13:00.761\nHow to have table manners\nat granny's Sunday party.\n\n00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:02.970\nI was taught that\nwhen I was very, very young.\n\n00:13:03.444 --> 00:13:08.421\nAnd when I was 13, I had a job\nat a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.\n\n00:13:08.445 --> 00:13:11.033\nI did internships in college,\n\n00:13:11.057 --> 00:13:14.260\nI was building things,\n\n00:13:14.284 --> 00:13:17.301\nand I also had to learn\nhow to do assignments.\n\n00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:20.915\nYou know, all I wanted to do was draw\npictures of horses when I was little.\n\n00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:23.767\nMy mother said, \"Well let's do\na picture of something else.\"\n\n00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:25.955\nThey've got to learn\nhow to do something else.\n\n00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:27.823\nLet's say the kid is fixated on Legos.\n\n00:13:27.847 --> 00:13:30.544\nLet's get him working\non building different things.\n\n00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:34.164\nThe thing about the autistic mind\nis it tends to be fixated.\n\n00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:38.066\nLike if the kid loves race cars,\nlet's use race cars for math.\n\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.530\nLet's figure out how long it takes\na race car to go a certain distance.\n\n00:13:41.554 --> 00:13:44.667\nIn other words, use that fixation\n\n00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:48.547\nin order to motivate that kid,\nthat's one of the things we need to do.\n\n00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:51.659\nI really get fed up when the teachers,\n\n00:13:51.683 --> 00:13:54.485\nespecially when you get away\nfrom this part of the country,\n\n00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:56.889\nthey don't know what to do\nwith these smart kids.\n\n00:13:56.913 --> 00:13:58.076\nIt just drives me crazy.\n\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.342\nWhat can visual thinkers\ndo when they grow up?\n\n00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:03.315\nThey can do graphic design,\nall kinds of stuff with computers,\n\n00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:06.722\nphotography, industrial design.\n\n00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:12.273\nThe pattern thinkers -- they're the ones\nthat are going to be your mathematicians,\n\n00:14:12.297 --> 00:14:14.804\nyour software engineers,\nyour computer programmers,\n\n00:14:14.828 --> 00:14:16.791\nall of those kinds of jobs.\n\n00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:20.387\nAnd then you've got the word minds;\nthey make great journalists,\n\n00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:22.934\nand they also make really,\nreally good stage actors.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.350\nBecause the thing about being autistic is,\n\n00:14:25.374 --> 00:14:28.205\nI had to learn social skills\nlike being in a play.\n\n00:14:28.229 --> 00:14:30.602\nYou just kind of ...\nyou just have to learn it.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.934\nAnd we need to be working\nwith these students.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.066\nAnd this brings up mentors.\n\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.190\nYou know, my science teacher\nwas not an accredited teacher.\n\n00:14:39.214 --> 00:14:40.934\nHe was a NASA space scientist.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.362\nSome states now are getting it to where,\nif you have a degree in biology\n\n00:14:44.386 --> 00:14:45.657\nor in chemistry,\n\n00:14:45.681 --> 00:14:48.518\nyou can come into the school\nand teach biology or chemistry.\n\n00:14:48.542 --> 00:14:50.068\nWe need to be doing that.\n\n00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:52.288\nBecause what I'm observing is,\n\n00:14:52.312 --> 00:14:54.361\nthe good teachers,\nfor a lot of these kids,\n\n00:14:54.385 --> 00:14:56.033\nare out in the community colleges.\n\n00:14:56.057 --> 00:14:58.593\nBut we need to be getting\nsome of these good teachers\n\n00:14:58.617 --> 00:14:59.768\ninto the high schools.\n\n00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:03.348\nAnother thing that can be very,\nvery, very successful is:\n\n00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:05.480\nthere's a lot of people\nthat may have retired\n\n00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:07.326\nfrom working in the software industry,\n\n00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.738\nand they can teach your kid.\n\n00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:11.571\nAnd it doesn't matter\nif what they teach them is old,\n\n00:15:11.595 --> 00:15:14.322\nbecause what you're doing\nis you're lighting the spark.\n\n00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:16.810\nYou're getting that kid turned on.\n\n00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:20.249\nAnd you get him turned on,\nthen you'll learn all the new stuff.\n\n00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:22.537\nMentors are just essential.\n\n00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:26.294\nI cannot emphasize enough\nwhat my science teacher did for me.\n\n00:15:26.902 --> 00:15:29.934\nAnd we've got to mentor them, hire them.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.766\nAnd if you bring them in\nfor internships in your companies,\n\n00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.263\nthe thing about the autism,\nAsperger-y kind of mind,\n\n00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:37.255\nyou've got to give them a specific task.\n\n00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:39.121\nDon't just say, \"Design new software.\"\n\n00:15:39.145 --> 00:15:41.412\nYou've got to tell them\nsomething more specific:\n\n00:15:41.436 --> 00:15:43.333\n\"We're designing software for a phone\n\n00:15:43.357 --> 00:15:45.157\nand it has to do some specific thing,\n\n00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:46.934\nand it can only use so much memory.\"\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.385\nThat's the kind of specificity you need.\n\n00:15:49.409 --> 00:15:51.268\nWell, that's the end of my

The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none, and that's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults, and there are very, very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children. In fact, if you were to be treated, you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates. This is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts. So, her caretakers took her to the village medicine man, and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital, the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons. The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists, who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age, that even if you have your eye corrected, the chances of your brain learning how to see are very, very slim \u2014 again, slim or none.So when I heard these two things, it troubled me deeply, both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons. So let me first start with the personal reason. It'll sound corny, but it's sincere. That's my son, Darius. As a new father, I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are, what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child. I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius, and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong. So that's the personal reason.Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods \u2014 that if the brain is older than four or five years of age, it loses its ability to learn \u2014 that doesn't sit well with me, because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately. The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work, two researchers who were at Harvard, and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology, which are remarkably beautiful studies, but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely. So, they did their work with kittens, with different kinds of deprivation regiments, and those studies, which date back to the '60s, are now being applied to human children.So I felt that I needed to do two things. One: provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment. That's the humanitarian mission. And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity. And these two missions, as you can tell, thread together perfectly. One adds to the other; in fact, one would be impossible without the other. So, to implement these twin missions, a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash. Prakash, as many of you know, is the Sanskrit word for light, and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children, we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience. And the logo \u2014 even though it looks extremely Irish, it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp. The Prakash, the overall effort has three components: outreach, to identify children in need of care; medical treatment; and in subsequent study. And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work.This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind.(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind, many children have permanent conditions. That's a case of microphthalmos, which is malformed eyes, and that's a permanent condition; it cannot be treated. That's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos. But, every so often, we come across children who show some residual vision, and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable. So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital. That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi, the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital. It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center, which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity. So, eating burgers actually helps.(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children, and ... ... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child, you will see the cause of his blindness. The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts, so opacities of the lens. In our eyes, the lens is clear, but in this child, the lens has become opaque, and therefore he can't see the world. So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye. Here's the eye with the opaque lens, the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted. And here's the same child three weeks post-operation, with the right eye open.(Applause)Thank you.So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible, and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children, and the story repeats itself. After treatment, the child gains significant functionality. In fact, the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation. We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right, SRD, and she got her sight late in life, and her vision is remarkable at this age. I should add a tragic postscript to this \u2014 she died two years ago in a bus accident. So, hers is just a truly inspiring story \u2014 unknown, but inspiring story. So when we started finding these results, as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press. Here's an article in Nature that profiled this work, and another one in Time. So, we were fairly convinced \u2014 we are convinced \u2014 that recovery is feasible, despite extended visual deprivation.The next obvious question to ask: What is the process of recovery? So, the way we study that is, let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity. The child is provided treatment, and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional; there is no quid pro quo. We treat many more children then we actually work with. Every child who needs treatment is treated. After treatment, about every week, we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line. And we try to do this for as long as possible. This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up. What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones?And we've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies, but I want to highlight one particular one, and that is image parsing into objects. So, any image of the kind that you see on the left, be it a real image or a synthetic image, it's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column, regions of different colors, different luminances. The brain has this complex task of putting together, integrating, subsets of these regions into something that's more meaningful, into what we would consider to be objects, as you see on the right. And nobody knows how this integration happens, and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.So, here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight. Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago, and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT, running the experiment with him. His visual-motor coordination is quite poor, but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out. If you show him real world images, if you show others like him real world images, they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented; it's made up of a collage, a patchwork, of regions of different colors and luminances. And that's what's indicated in the green outlines. When you ask them, \"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,\" these are the regions that they point to. So the world is this complex patchwork of regions. Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object. Interestingly enough, you give them a few months, and this is what happens.Doctor: How many are these?Patient: These are two things.Doctor: What are their shapes?Patient: Their shapes ... This one is a circle, and this is a square.PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about. And the question is: What underlies this transformation? It's a profound question, and what's even more amazing is how simple the answer is. The answer lies in motion and that's what I want to show you in the next clip.Doctor: What shape do you see here?Patient: I can't make it out.Doctor: Now?Patient: Triangle.Doctor: How many things are these? Now, how many things are these?Patient: Two.Doctor: What are these things?Patient: A square and a circle.PS: And we see this pattern over and over again. The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information. So the inference we are deriving from this, and several such experiments, is that dynamic information processing, or motion processing, serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition.This simple idea has far reaching implications. And let me just quickly mention two, one, drawing from the domain of engineering, and one from the clinic. So, from the perspective of engineering, we can ask: Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system, can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-based vision systems that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed by a human programmer? And that's what we're trying to do.I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain. So we are creating Dylan, which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive, and autonomously discovering: What are the objects in this visual input? So, don't worry about the internals of Dylan. Here, I'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan. The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs, as I said, of the same kind that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get. But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out: Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs? So, I thought, could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier, and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan? So that's what we did. (Laughter) I had to have long conversations with my wife. (Laughter) In fact, Pam, if you're watching this, please forgive me.So, we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity. As some of you might know, babyies are born pretty much legally blind. Their acuity \u2014 our acuity is 20/20; babies' acuity is like 20/800, so they are looking at the world in a very, very blurry fashion. Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.(Laughter) (Applause)Thankfully, there isn't any audio to go with this. What's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input, the baby, very quickly, is able to discover meaning in such input. But then two or three days afterward, babies begin to pay attention to their mother's or their father's face. How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that, and using this mantra of motion, Dylan actually can do that. So, given that kind of video input, with just about six or seven minutes worth of video, Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces. So, it's an important demonstration of the power of motion.The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism. Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers. When we saw that, we asked: Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath, of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism? Because, if that hypothesis were to be true, it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype.What you're going to see are video clips of two children \u2014 one neurotypical, one with autism, playing Pong. So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking. In red are the eye movement traces. This is the neurotypical child, and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go. Even before the ball gets to a place, the child is already looking there. Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game. Instead of anticipating, the child always follows where the ball has been. The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism. So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we'll have more results to report soon.Looking ahead, if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we've treated so far, this is the magnitude of the problem. The red dots are the children we have not treated. So, there are many, many more children who need to be treated, and in order to expand the scope of the project, we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children, which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital, a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility. The Prakash Center will integrate health care, education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts.So, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence, it's had an impact in multiple areas, ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain, to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism, the development of autonomous machine vision systems, education of the undergraduate and graduate students, and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness. And for my students and I, it's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research, while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with.Thank you

you\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nthat if you are older than four or five years of age,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nthat even if you have your eye corrected,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthe chances of your brain learning how to see\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nare very, very slim --\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nagain, slim or none.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nSo when I heard these two things,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nit troubled me deeply,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nboth because of personal reasons\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nand scientific reasons.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nSo let me first start with the personal reason.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt'll sound corny, but it's sincere.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nThat's my son, Darius.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAs a new father,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nI have a qualitatively different sense\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nof just how delicate babies are,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nwhat our obligations are towards them\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand how much love\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nwe can feel towards a child.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI would move heaven and earth\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nin order to get treatment for Darius,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand for me to be told\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthat there might be other Dariuses\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwho are not getting treatment,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nthat's just viscerally wrong.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nSo that's the personal reason.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nScientific reason is that this notion\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nfrom neuroscience of critical periods --\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthat if the brain is older\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nthan four or five years of age,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nit loses its ability to learn --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthat doesn't sit well with me,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nbecause I don't think that idea\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nhas been tested adequately.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe birth of the idea is from\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\ntwo researchers who were at Harvard,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand they got the Nobel Prize in 1981\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nfor their studies of visual physiology,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwhich are remarkably beautiful studies,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nbut I believe some of their work\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nhas been extrapolated\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\ninto the human domain prematurely.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo, they did their work with kittens,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwith different kinds of deprivation regiments,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand those studies,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nwhich date back to the '60s,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nare now being applied to human children.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo I felt that I needed to do two things.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nOne: provide care\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nto children who are currently\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nbeing deprived of treatment.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThat's the humanitarian mission.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd the scientific mission would be\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nto test the limits\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nof visual plasticity.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd these two missions, as you can tell,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nthread together perfectly. One adds to the other;\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nin fact, one would be impossible without the other.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo, to implement\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nthese twin missions,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\na few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nPrakash, as many of you know,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nis the Sanskrit word for light,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand the idea is that\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin bringing light into the lives of children,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nwe also have a chance\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nof shedding light on some of the\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\ndeepest mysteries of neuroscience.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nAnd the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nit's actually derived from\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthe Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThe Prakash, the overall effort\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nhas three components:\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\noutreach, to identify children in need of care;\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nmedical treatment; and in subsequent study.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd I want to show you a short video clip\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat illustrates the first two components of this work.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nThis is an outreach station\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nconducted at a school for the blind.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\n(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nPawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nmany children have permanent conditions.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThat's a case of microphthalmos,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwhich is malformed eyes,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand that's a permanent condition;\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nit cannot be treated.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThat's an extreme of micropthalmos\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\ncalled enophthalmos.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBut, every so often, we come across children\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwho show some residual vision,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand that is a very good sign\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nthat the condition might actually be treatable.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThat's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthe Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nIt has a very well-equipped\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\npediatric ophthalmic center,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhich was made possible in part\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nby a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo, eating burgers actually helps.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\neye-health in many children, and ...\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\n... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nPS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nyou will see the cause of his blindness.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThe whites that you see in the middle of his pupils\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nare congenital cataracts,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nso opacities of the lens.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nIn our eyes, the lens is clear,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nbut in this child, the lens has become opaque,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nand therefore he can't see the world.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nHere's the eye with the opaque lens,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nthe opaque lens extracted\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand an acrylic lens inserted.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nAnd here's the same child\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthree weeks post-operation,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nwith the right eye open.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:42.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThank you.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nSo, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nthat recovery is possible,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand we have now\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nprovided treatment to over 200 children,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand the story repeats itself.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAfter treatment, the child\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\ngains significant functionality.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nIn fact, the story holds true\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\neven if you have a person who got sight\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nafter several years of deprivation.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nWe did a paper a few years ago\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nabout this woman that you see on the right, SRD,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nand she got her sight late in life,\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand her vision is remarkable at this age.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI should add a tragic postscript to this --\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nshe died two years ago\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nin a bus accident.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nSo, hers is just a truly inspiring story --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nunknown, but inspiring story.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nSo when we started finding these results,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nas you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nin the scientific and the popular press.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nHere's an article in Nature\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nthat profiled this work,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand another one in Time.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSo, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nthat recovery is feasible,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\ndespite extended visual deprivation.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThe next obvious question to ask:\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nWhat is the process of recovery?\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nSo, the way we study that is,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nlet's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThe child is provided treatment,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand I want to stress that the treatment\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nis completely unconditional;\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nthere is no quid pro quo.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe treat many more children then we actually work with.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nEvery child who needs treatment is treated.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAfter treatment, about every week,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwe run the child\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\non a battery of simple visual tests\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nin order to see how their visual skills\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nare coming on line.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd we try to do this for as long as possible.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThis arc of development\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ngives us unprecedented\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand extremely valuable information\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nabout how the scaffolding of vision\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\ngets set up.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWhat might be the causal connections\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nbetween the early developing skills\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nand the later developing ones?\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd we've used this general approach to study\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nmany different visual proficiencies,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nbut I want to highlight one particular one,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand that is image parsing into objects.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo, any image of the kind that you see on the left,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nbe it a real image or a synthetic image,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nit's made up of little regions\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nthat you see in the middle column,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nregions of different colors, different luminances.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThe brain has this complex task\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nof putting together, integrating,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nsubsets of these regions\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\ninto something that's more meaningful,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\ninto what we would consider to be objects,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nas you see on the right.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd nobody knows how this integration happens,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nand that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nSo, here's what happens\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nvery soon after the onset of sight.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nHere's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nrunning the experiment with him.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nHis visual-motor coordination is quite poor,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nbut you get a general sense\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nof what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nIf you show him real world images,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nif you show others like him real world images,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nthey are unable to recognize most of the objects\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nbecause the world to them is over-fragmented;\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nit's made up of a collage, a patchwork,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nof regions of different colors and luminances.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd that's what's indicated in the green outlines.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWhen you ask them,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\n\"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,\"\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthese are the regions that they point to.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nSo the world is this complex\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\npatchwork of regions.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nEven the shadow on the ball\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nbecomes its own object.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nInterestingly enough,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nyou give them a few months,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand this is what happens.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nDoctor: How many are these?\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nPatient: These are two things.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nDoctor: What are their shapes?\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nPatient: Their shapes ...\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThis one is a circle,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand this\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nis a square.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nPS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd the question is:\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWhat underlies this transformation?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nIt's a profound question,\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nand what's even more amazing is how simple\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthe answer is.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe answer lies in motion\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nand that's what I want to show you in the next clip.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nDoctor: What shape do you see here?\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nPatient: I can't make it out.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nDoctor: Now?\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nPatient: Triangle.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nDoctor: How many things are these?\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nNow, how many things are these?\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nPatient: Two.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nDoctor: What are these things?\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nPatient: A square and a circle.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nPS: And we see this pattern over and over again.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThe one thing the visual system needs\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nin order to begin parsing the world\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nis dynamic information.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nSo the inference we are deriving from this,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand several such experiments,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nis that dynamic information processing,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nor motion processing,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nserves as the bedrock for building\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthe rest of the complexity of visual processing;\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nit leads to visual integration\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand eventually to recognition.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThis simple idea has far reaching implications.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nAnd let me just quickly mention two,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\none, drawing from the domain of engineering,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand one from the clinic.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nSo, from the perspective of engineering,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nwe can ask: Goven that we know\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nthat motion is so important for the human visual system,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\ncan we use this as a recipe\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nfor constructing machine-based vision systems\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nthat can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nby a human programmer?\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nAnd that's what we're trying to do.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nwhatever basic knowledge you gain.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo we are creating Dylan,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwhich is a computational system\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwith an ambitious goal\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nof taking in visual inputs\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nof the same kind that a human child would receive,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand autonomously discovering:\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nWhat are the objects in this visual input?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nSo, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nHere, I'm just going to talk about\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nhow we test Dylan.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThe way we test Dylan is by giving it\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\ninputs, as I said, of the same kind\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nthat a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nBut for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nWow can we get these kinds of video inputs?\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nSo, I thought,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\ncould we have Darius\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nserve as our babycam carrier,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nSo that's what we did.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nI had to have long conversations with my wife.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nIn fact, Pam, if you're watching this,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nplease forgive me.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo, we modified the optics of the camera\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nin order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nAs some of you might know,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nbabyies are born pretty much legally blind.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nTheir acuity -- our acuity is 20/20;\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nbabies' acuity is like 20/800,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nso they are looking at the world\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nin a very, very blurry fashion.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nHere's what a baby-cam video looks like.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThankfully, there isn't any audio\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto go with this.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nWhat's amazing is that working with such\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nhighly degraded input,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nthe baby, very quickly, is able\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nto discover meaning in such input.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nBut then two or three days afterward,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nbabies begin to pay attention\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nto their mother's or their father's face.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nHow does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nand using this mantra of motion,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nDylan actually can do that.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nSo, given that kind of video input,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nwith just about six or seven minutes worth of video,\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nDylan can begin to extract patterns\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nthat include faces.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nSo, it's an important demonstration\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nof the power of motion.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThe clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nVisual integration has been associated with autism\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nby several researchers.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nWhen we saw that, we asked:\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nCould the impairment in visual integration\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nbe the manifestation of something underneath,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nof dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nBecause, if that hypothesis were to be true,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nit would have massive repercussions in our understanding\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nof what's causing the many different aspects\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nof the autism phenotype.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nWhat you're going to see are\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nvideo clips of two children -- one neurotypical,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\none with autism, playing Pong.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nSo, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nIn red are the eye movement traces.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThis is the neurotypical child, and what you see\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nis that the child is able to make cues\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nof the dynamic information\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nto predict where the ball is going to go.\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nEven before the ball gets to a place,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nthe child is already looking there.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nContrast this with a child\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nwith autism playing the same game.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nInstead of anticipating,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nthe child always follows where the ball has been.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nThe efficiency of the use\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nof dynamic information\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nseems to be significantly compromised in autism.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nSo we are pursuing this line of work\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand hopefully we'll have\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nmore results to report soon.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nLooking ahead, if you think of this disk\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nas representing all of the children\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nwe've treated so far,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthis is the magnitude of the problem.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nThe red dots are the children we have not treated.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nSo, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand in order to expand the scope of the project,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nwe are planning on launching\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nThe Prakash Center for Children,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nwhich will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\na school for the children we are treating\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nand also a cutting-edge research facility.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nThe Prakash Center will integrate health care,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\neducation and research in a way\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nthat truly creates the whole\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nto be greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nSo, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nit's had an impact in multiple areas,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nranging from basic neuroscience\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nplasticity and learning in the brain,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nto clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nthe development of autonomous machine vision systems,\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\neducation of the undergraduate and graduate students,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nand most importantly in the alleviation\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nof childhood blindness.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd for my students and I, it's been\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\njust a phenomenal experience\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nbecause we have gotten to do interesting research,\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nwhile at the same time\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nhelping the many children that we have worked with.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My 5 lives as an artist", "duration": "1075", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/raghava_kk_five_lives_of_an_artist", "transcript": "I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo. I was sent straight away to my school principal, and my school principal, a sweet nun, looked at my book with disgust, flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes \u2014 you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her \u2014 and the nun slapped me on my face and said, \"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun.\"I had no clue what she was talking about, but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again until the ninth grade. Thanks to a really boring lecture, I started caricaturing my teachers in school. And, you know, I got a lot of popularity. I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports. I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home. I'm not on top of the class. So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity. I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again. So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I had drawn, glorified my school principal, put him right on top, and gifted it to him. He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board. (Laughter) This is a part of that. And I became a school hero. All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.I have to tell you a little bit about my family. That's my mother. I love her to bits. She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love. She's a bit of a hippie. She said, \"Don't say that,\" but I'm saying it anyway. The rest of my family are boring academics, busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car. My father's a little different. My father believed in a holistic approach to living, and, you know, every time he taught us, he'd say, \"I hate these books, because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.\"While he still held that worldview, I was 16, I got the best lawyer in town, my older brother Karthik, and I sat him down, and I said, \"Pa, from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined, I'm going to be curious, I'm going to learn something new every day, I'm going to be very hard working, and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.\" And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me. And I said, \"Hold that thought.\" I said, \"Can I quit school then?\"But, to cut a long story short, I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist. I must have done about 30,000 caricatures. I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces, anything for anyone who wanted to use my services. But, most importantly, while I was traveling, I taught children cartooning, and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous. And mad and crazy and fun. When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally. When I was 18 I started my own school. However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter.So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my home town, Bangalore. And, you know, just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here, and if you had to meet Bush, it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight. I had to meet my Prime Minister. I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land. I saw layers of security. I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards, but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third. And what happened was, to my luck, I saw a nuclear scientist at whose party I had done cartoons. I ran up to him, and said, \"Hello, sir. How do you do?\" He said, \"What are you doing here, Raghava?\" I said, \"I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.\" He said, \"Oh, so am I.\" I hopped into his car, and off we went through the remaining layers of security. (Applause) Thank you. I sat him down, I caricatured him, and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.This is one I remember fondly. Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think because I altered the map of New York, if you notice. (Laughter) Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you \u2014 (Laughter) Should I just turn that off? The next slide I'm about to show you, is a little more serious. I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after 9/11. What was, for me, a very naive observation, turned out to be a disaster. That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails, hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this. I was also asked to leave the organization, a cartoonists' organization in America, that for me was my lifeline. That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful, art comes with responsibility.Anyway, what I did was I decided that I need to take a break. I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school, and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks, and I decided to go traveling. When I went traveling, I remember, I met this fabulous old man, who I met when I was caricaturing, who turned out to be an artist, in Italy. He invited me to his studio. He said, \"Come and visit.\" When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever. I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling. I said, \"Oh, my God. What is that?\" And I asked him, and he said, \"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die. In the morning, I am born again.\" I thought he was koo koo, but something about that really stuck. I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that. So I said, \"I am dead, so I need to be born again.\"So, I wanted to be a painter like him, except, I don't know how to paint. So, I tried going to the art store. You know, there are a hundred types of brushes. Forget it, they will confuse you even if you know how to draw. So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself. I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted and a little bit about my city, Bangalore. (Music) They had to be larger than life. Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger. And even bigger. And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted. It was so exciting. Except, I even started painting dancers. Here for example is a Flamenco dancer, except there was one problem. I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them, and I made some money, sold my paintings and would rush off to France or Spain and work with them. That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.But I had one problem, my paintings never danced. As much energy as I put into them while making them, they never danced. So I decided \u2014 I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning. I called my friends, painted on their bodies, and had them dance in front of a painting. And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive. And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus. And I sat like you guys there in the audience. And I saw my work come alive. You know, normally you work in isolation, and you show at a gallery, but here, the work was coming alive, and it had some other artists working with me.The collaborative effort was fabulous. I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet. I started doing fashion. This is a fashion show we held in London. The best collaboration, of course, is with children. They are ruthless, they are honest, but they're full of energy and fun. This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation. And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids. And, in exchange for me working with them, they taught me how to be cool. I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me. They said, \"Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad.\" (Laughter)Then I said, all this is good, but I want to paint like a real painter. American education is so expensive. I was in India, and I was walking down the streets, and I saw a billboard painter. And these guys paint humongous paintings, and they look really good. And I wondered how they did it from so close. So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys, and I said, \"How do you paint like that? Who taught you?\" And he said, \"Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you, but we're leaving the city, because billboard painters are a dying, extinct bunch of artists, because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.\" I said, in exchange for education in how to paint, I will support them, and I started a company. And since then, I've been painting all over the place. This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment. This is another painting. And, in fact, I started painting on anything, and started sending them around town.Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration has been with her, Netra. Netra and I met when she was 18. I must have been 19 and a half then, and it was love at first sight. I lived in India. She lived in America. She'd come every two months to visit me, and then I said I'm the man, I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate. I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you. I did that twice, and I went broke. So then I said, \"Nets, what do I do?\" She said, \"Why don't you send me your paintings? My dad knows a bunch of rich guys. We'll try and con them into buying it, and then...\" But it turned out, after I sent the works to her, that her dad's friends, like most of you, are geeks. I'm joking. (Laughter) No, they were really big geeks, and they didn't know much about art. So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.So what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it. She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work. She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers, a company, everything, and she became my manager. That's us in New York. Notice one thing, we're equal here. Something happened along the line. (Laughter)But this brought me \u2014 with Netra managing my career \u2014 it brought me a lot of success. I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar. I loved the attention. This is all the press we got, and we said, it's time to celebrate. And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra. I said, \"Let's get married.\" And I said, \"Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us, all the people who bought our work.\" And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people, who had made a difference \u2014 a ridiculous list, but I was determined to bring them to India, so \u2014 a lot of them were in India. 150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding. We had fashion designers, installation artists, models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers, all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation. And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws. I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.But all this excitement led to the press writing about us. We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later, but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after. My mother fell very ill. I love my mother and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die. And they said you have to say bye to her, you have to do what you have to do. And I was devastated. I had shows booked up for another year. I was on a high. And I couldn't. I could not.My life was not exuberant. I could not live this larger than life person. I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind. Of course, my work turned ugly, but another thing happened. I lost all my audiences. The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared. The collectors, the friends, the press, everyone said, \"Nice, but thank you.\" \"No thank you,\" was more like it. But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut, because I was painting it from my gut. If they wanted beauty, I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized. Of course, none of them liked it.My works also turned autobiographical. At this point, something else happened. A very, very dear friend of mine came out of the closet, and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay, and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person. I was very upset. I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl \u2014 that's me there \u2014 because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys. (Laughter) Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk. It's a secret.So, after this, my works turned a little violent. I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform. And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality. This time, not only did my collectors disappear, the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing. It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken. I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.So, I decided it was time to end and go back home. This time I said let's try something different. I need to be reborn again. And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children, the best way to have a new lease on life, is to have a child. I decided to have a child, and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong. How can a family get dysfunctional? And Rudra was born. That's my little son.And two magical things happened after he was born. My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation, and this man was elected president of this country. You know I sat at home and I watched. I teared up and I said that's where I want to be. So Netra and I wound up our life, closed up everything we had, and we decided to move to New York. And this was just eight months ago.I moved back to New York, my work has changed. Everything about my work has become more whimsical. This one is called \"What the Fuck Was I Thinking?\" It talks about mental incest. You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy. But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything. But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you. (Laughter) These are just different cartoons.And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story. I was talking to mother and father this morning, and my dad said, \"I know you have so much you want to say, but you have to talk about your work with children.\" So I said, okay.I work with children all over the world, and that's an entirely different talk, but I want to leave you with one story that really, really inspired me. I met Belinda when she was 16. I was 17. I was in Australia, and Belinda had cancer, and I was told she's not going to live very long. They, in fact, told me three weeks. I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl, and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness. I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her. And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time \u2014 I told her how I ended up in Australia, how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket, and all the stories. And I drew it out for her. And then I left. Belinda died and within a few days of her death, they published a book for her, and she used my cartoon on the cover. And she wrote a little note, she said, \"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.\"For me, my art is my magic carpet ride. I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride, and touch children and be honest. Thank you so much.

I'm really bad at sports.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nI don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nI'm not on top of the class.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nSo for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nI got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nSo what I did was I quickly put together\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\na collage of all the teachers I had drawn,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nglorified my school principal, put him right on top,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand gifted it to him.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nHe had a good laugh at the other teachers\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand put it up on the notice board.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThis is a part of that.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd I became a school hero.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nAll my seniors knew me. I felt really special.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nI have to tell you a little bit about my family.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThat's my mother. I love her to bits.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nShe's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nShe's a bit of a hippie.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nShe said, \"Don't say that,\" but I'm saying it anyway.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nThe rest of my family are boring academics,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nbusy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nMy father's a little different.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nMy father believed in a holistic approach to living,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nand, you know, every time he taught us,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nhe'd say, \"I hate these books,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nbecause these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution.\"\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nWhile he still held that worldview, I was 16,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nI got the best lawyer in town,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nmy older brother Karthik,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand I sat him down, and I said, \"Pa,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nfrom today onwards I've decided\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI'm going to be disciplined,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nI'm going to be curious,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nI'm going to learn something new every day,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nI'm going to be very hard working,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand I'm not going to depend on you\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nemotionally or financially.\"\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd he was very impressed. He was all tearing up.

I had somebody count the number of books with \"happiness\" in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness, among researchers. There is a lot of happiness coaching. Everybody would like to make people happier. But in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness.And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness, and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness, because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word \"happiness\" is just not a useful word anymore, because we apply it to too many different things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory; basically, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third is the focusing illusion, and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance. I mean, this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right.Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question-and-answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story \u2014 He said he'd been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. What it had ruined were the memories of the experience. He had had the experience. He had had 20 minutes of glorious music. They counted for nothing because he was left with a memory; the memory was ruined, and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self, who lives in the present and knows the present, is capable of re-living the past, but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches \u2014 you know, when the doctor asks, \"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?\" And then there is a remembering self, and the remembering self is the one that keeps score, and maintains the story of our life, and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question, \"How have you been feeling lately?\" or \"How was your trip to Albania?\" or something like that. Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness.Now, the remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memories \u2014 it starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells us stories, that is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days, but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s. They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds. Here are two patients, those are their recordings. And you are asked, \"Who of them suffered more?\" And it's a very easy question. Clearly, Patient B suffered more \u2014 his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more.But now there is another question: \"How much did these patients think they suffered?\" And here is a surprise. The surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B. The stories of the colonoscopies were different, and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great \u2014 but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter) but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end; it's a bad story. How do we know that? Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy, and much later, too, \"How bad was the whole thing, in total?\" And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing self, clearly, B had a worse time. Now, what you could do with Patient A, and we actually ran clinical experiments, and it has been done, and it does work \u2014 you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off, and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off, because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story? And that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defines a story are changes, significant moments and endings. Endings are very, very important and, in this case, the ending dominated.Now, the experiencing self lives its life continuously. It has moments of experience, one after the other. And you can ask: What happens to these moments? And the answer is really straightforward: They are lost forever. I mean, most of the moments of our life \u2014 and I calculated, you know, the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 600 million of them; in a month, there are about 600,000 \u2014 most of them don't leave a trace. Most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self. And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us.So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing self, if you have a vacation, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation. That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self. For the remembering self, a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not changed the story. And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self; time has very little impact on the story.Now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is actually the one that makes decisions because, if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad, and that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences, we choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think of our future as anticipated memories. And basically you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need.I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case; that is, we go on vacations, to a very large extent, in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit hard to justify I think. I mean, how much do we consume our memories? That is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self. And when I think about that, I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had, and I think of it relatively often, relative to how much I think of other vacations. And I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip, I would say, for about 25 minutes in the last four years. Now, if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it, I would have spent another hour. Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences?So I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed, and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything. Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter) And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two selves, and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answer, and if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves.Now, the two selves bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per self. So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self? And then you would ask: How happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life? And they're all \u2014 happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process. What are the emotions that can be measured? And, by the way, now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time. If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self, it's a completely different thing. This is not about how happily a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notion. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness, and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being, who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way.The distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years, and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences, and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent years, we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life, and vice versa. Just to give you a sense of the correlation, the correlation is about .5. What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, \"Oh his father is six feet tall,\" how much would you know about his height? Well, you would know something about his height, but there's a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So the correlation is low.We know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. We know that money is very important, goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people that we like. There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being. It is a completely different notion.Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life, and we actually live. So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question, you think people must be happier in California if, say, you live in Ohio. (Laughter) And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places, and that contrast, say, is in climate. Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it's not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now, because the reflective self is in charge, you may end up \u2014 some people may end up moving to California. And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier. Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier, because, when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio, and they will feel they made the right decision.It is very difficult to think straight about well-being, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is.Thank you.(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you. Thank you so much. Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago, you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey. Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now?Daniel Kahneman: Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When we looked at how feelings, vary with income. And it turns out that, below an income of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans \u2014 and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000, so it's a large representative sample \u2014 below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...CA: 60,000.DK: 60,000. (Laughter) 60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get. Above that, we get an absolutely flat line. I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat. Clearly, what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery, and we can measure that misery very, very clearly. In terms of the other self, the remembering self, you get a different story. The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions.CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. If people took seriously that finding, I mean, it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about, like for example, taxation policy and so forth. Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally, would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it?DK: You know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States, no question about that, but in the U.K., it is happening, and in other countries it is happening. People are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy. It's going to take a while, and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness, or whether they want to study life evaluation, so we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think, and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come. In the United States, efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two, part of national statistics.CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will \u2014 or at least should be \u2014 the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years. Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics. Thank you, Danny Kahneman.", "id": 779, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nEverybody talks about happiness these days.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nI had somebody count the number of books\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nwith \"happiness\" in the title published in the last five years\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nand they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nThere is a huge wave of interest in happiness,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\namong researchers.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nThere is a lot of happiness coaching.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nEverybody would like to make people happier.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nBut in spite of all this flood of work,\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nthere are several cognitive traps\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthat sort of make it almost impossible to think straight\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nabout happiness.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAnd my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nThis applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nand it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nbecause it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nThe first of these traps\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nis a reluctance to admit complexity.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nIt turns out that the word \"happiness\"\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nis just not a useful word anymore,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nbecause we apply it to too many different things.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nI think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nbut by and large,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthis is something that we'll have to give up\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand we'll have to adopt the more complicated view\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nof what well-being is.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nThe second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nbasically, it's between being happy in your life,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nand being happy about your life\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nor happy with your life.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nAnd those are two very different concepts,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd the third is the focusing illusion,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nand it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthat affects well-being\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nwithout distorting its importance.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nI mean, this is a real cognitive trap.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nThere's just no way of getting it right.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nNow, I'd like to start with an example\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nof somebody who had a question-and-answer session\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nafter one of my lectures reported a story,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nand that was a story --\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nHe said he'd been listening to a symphony,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand it was absolutely glorious music\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand at the very end of the recording,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthere was a dreadful screeching sound.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nAnd then he added, really quite emotionally,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nit ruined the whole experience.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nBut it hadn't.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nWhat it had ruined were the memories of the experience.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nHe had had the experience.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nHe had had 20 minutes of glorious music.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nThey counted for nothing\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbecause he was left with a memory;\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthe memory was ruined,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nWhat this is telling us, really,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nis that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nin terms of two selves.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThere is an experiencing self,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nwho lives in the present\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand knows the present,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nis capable of re-living the past,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nbut basically it has only the present.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nIt's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nyou know, when the doctor asks,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\n\"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?\"\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd then there is a remembering self,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand the remembering self is the one that keeps score,\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nand maintains the story of our life,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nand it's the one that the doctor approaches\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nin asking the question,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n\"How have you been feeling lately?\"\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nor \"How was your trip to Albania?\" or something like that.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThose are two very different entities,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthe experiencing self and the remembering self,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand getting confused between them is part of the mess\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nabout the notion of happiness.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nNow, the remembering self\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nis a storyteller.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd that really starts with a basic response of our memories --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nit starts immediately.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWe don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nOur memory tells us stories,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nthat is, what we get to keep from our experiences\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nis a story.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd let me begin with one example.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThis is an old study.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThose are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nbut it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThey were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nHere are two patients,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthose are their recordings.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd you are asked, \"Who of them suffered more?\"\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd it's a very easy question.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nClearly, Patient B suffered more --\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nhis colonoscopy was longer,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand every minute of pain that Patient A had,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nPatient B had, and more.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nBut now there is another question:\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\n\"How much did these patients think they suffered?\"\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd here is a surprise.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThe surprise is that Patient A\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nhad a much worse memory of the colonoscopy\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthan Patient B.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThe stories of the colonoscopies were different,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbut one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nbut one of them is distinctly worse than the other.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nAnd the one that is worse\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nis the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nit's a bad story.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nHow do we know that?\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBecause we asked these people after their colonoscopy,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand much later, too,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\n\"How bad was the whole thing, in total?\"\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nNow this is a direct conflict\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nbetween the experiencing self and the remembering self.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nclearly, B had a worse time.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nNow, what you could do with Patient A,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand we actually ran clinical experiments,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nand it has been done, and it does work --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nyou could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nby just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThat will cause the patient\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nto suffer, but just a little\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand much less than before.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAnd if you do that for a couple of minutes,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nyou have made the experiencing self\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nof Patient A worse off,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand you have the remembering self of Patient A\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\na lot better off,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nbecause now you have endowed Patient A\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwith a better story\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nabout his experience.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWhat defines a story?\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd that is true of the stories\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat memory delivers for us,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand it's also true of the stories that we make up.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWhat defines a story are changes,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nsignificant moments and endings.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nEndings are very, very important\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand, in this case, the ending dominated.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nNow, the experiencing self\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nlives its life continuously.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nIt has moments of experience, one after the other.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd you can ask: What happens to these moments?\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd the answer is really straightforward:\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThey are lost forever.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nI mean, most of the moments of our life --\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand I calculated, you know, the psychological present\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nis said to be about three seconds long;\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nthat means that, you know,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nin a life there are about 600 million of them;\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nin a month, there are about 600,000 --\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nmost of them don't leave a trace.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nMost of them are completely ignored\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nby the remembering self.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd yet, somehow you get the sense\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nthat they should count,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat what happens during these moments of experience\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nis our life.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nIt's the finite resource that we're spending\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nwhile we're on this earth.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd how to spend it\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nwould seem to be relevant,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbut that is not the story\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthat the remembering self keeps for us.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nSo we have the remembering self\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand the experiencing self,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand they're really quite distinct.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThe biggest difference between them\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nis in the handling of time.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nFrom the point of view of the experiencing self,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nif you have a vacation,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nand the second week is just as good as the first,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthen the two-week vacation\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nis twice as good as the one-week vacation.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThat's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nFor the remembering self, a two-week vacation\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nis barely better than the one-week vacation\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nbecause there are no new memories added.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nYou have not changed the story.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd in this way,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\ntime is actually the critical variable\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthat distinguishes a remembering self\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nfrom an experiencing self;\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\ntime has very little impact on the story.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nNow, the remembering self does more\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthan remember and tell stories.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIt is actually the one that makes decisions\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbecause, if you have a patient who has had, say,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\ntwo colonoscopies with two different surgeons\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand is deciding which of them to choose,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nthen the one that chooses\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis the one that has the memory that is less bad,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nand that's the surgeon that will be chosen.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe experiencing self\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nhas no voice in this choice.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWe actually don't choose between experiences,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwe choose between memories of experiences.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd even when we think about the future,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwe don't think of our future normally as experiences.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nWe think of our future\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nas anticipated memories.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nAnd basically you can look at this,\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nyou know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand you can think of the remembering self\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nsort of dragging the experiencing self\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nthrough experiences that\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nthe experiencing self doesn't need.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nI have that sense that\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nwhen we go on vacations\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthis is very frequently the case;\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthat is, we go on vacations,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nto a very large extent,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nin the service of our remembering self.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd this is a bit hard to justify I think.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nI mean, how much do we consume our memories?\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThat is one of the explanations\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthat is given for the dominance\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nof the remembering self.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd when I think about that, I think about a vacation\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nwe had in Antarctica a few years ago,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nwhich was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand I think of it relatively often,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nrelative to how much I think of other vacations.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nAnd I probably have consumed\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nmy memories of that three-week trip, I would say,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nfor about 25 minutes in the last four years.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nNow, if I had ever opened the folder\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nwith the 600 pictures in it,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nI would have spent another hour.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nNow, that is three weeks,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand that is at most an hour and a half.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThere seems to be a discrepancy.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nNow, I may be a bit extreme, you know,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nin how little appetite I have for consuming memories,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nbut even if you do more of this,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthere is a genuine question:\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWhy do we put so much weight on memory\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nrelative to the weight that we put on experiences?\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nSo I want you to think\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nabout a thought experiment.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nImagine that for your next vacation,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nyou know that at the end of the vacation\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nall your pictures will be destroyed,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand you'll get an amnesic drug\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nso that you won't remember anything.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nNow, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd if you would choose a different vacation,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthere is a conflict between your two selves,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nand it's actually not at all obvious, because\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nif you think in terms of time,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthen you get one answer,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nand if you think in terms of memories,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nyou might get another answer.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nWhy do we pick the vacations we do\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nis a problem that confronts us\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nwith a choice between the two selves.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow, the two selves\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nbring up two notions of happiness.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nThere are really two concepts of happiness\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthat we can apply, one per self.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd then you would ask: How happy are the moments\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nin the experiencing self's life?\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd they're all -- happiness for moments\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nis a fairly complicated process.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nWhat are the emotions that can be measured?\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nAnd, by the way, now we are capable\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nof getting a pretty good idea\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nof the happiness of the experiencing self over time.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nIf you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nit's a completely different thing.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThis is not about how happily a person lives.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nIt is about how satisfied or pleased the person is\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nwhen that person thinks about her life.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nVery different notion.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nAnyone who doesn't distinguish those notions\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nis going to mess up the study of happiness,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nand I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwho've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nin precisely this way.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThe distinction between the\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nhappiness of the experiencing self\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand the satisfaction of the remembering self\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nhas been recognized in recent years,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nand there are now efforts to measure the two separately.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThe Gallup Organization has a world poll\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhere more than half a million people\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nhave been asked questions\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nabout what they think of their life\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand about their experiences,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand there have been other efforts along those lines.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nSo in recent years, we have begun to learn\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nabout the happiness of the two selves.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd the main lesson I think that we have learned\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nis they are really different.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nYou can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand that really doesn't teach you much\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nabout how happily they're living their life,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand vice versa.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nJust to give you a sense of the correlation,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nthe correlation is about .5.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nWhat that means is if you met somebody,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand you were told, \"Oh his father is six feet tall,\"\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nhow much would you know about his height?\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nWell, you would know something about his height,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nbut there's a lot of uncertainty.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nYou have that much uncertainty.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nIf I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nyou have a lot of uncertainty\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nabout how happy they are\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwith their experiencing self.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nSo the correlation is low.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe know something about what controls\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nsatisfaction of the happiness self.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWe know that money is very important,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\ngoals are very important.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe know that happiness is mainly\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nbeing satisfied with people that we like,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nspending time with people that we like.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nThere are other pleasures, but this is dominant.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nSo if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nyou are going to end up\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\ndoing very different things.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nThe bottom line of what I've said here\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nis that we really should not think of happiness\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nas a substitute for well-being.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIt is a completely different notion.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nNow, very quickly,\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nanother reason we cannot think straight about happiness\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nis that we do not attend to the same things\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nwhen we think about life, and we actually live.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nSo, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nyou are not going to get to the correct answer.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nWhen you ask that question,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nyou think people must be happier in California\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nif, say, you live in Ohio.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nAnd what happens is\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhen you think about living in California,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nyou are thinking of the contrast\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nbetween California and other places,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand that contrast, say, is in climate.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nWell, it turns out that climate\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nis not very important to the experiencing self\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nand it's not even very important to the reflective self\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthat decides how happy people are.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nBut now, because the reflective self is in charge,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nyou may end up -- some people may end up\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nmoving to California.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nto people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWell, their experiencing self\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nis not going to get happier.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nWe know that.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nBut one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nbecause, when they think about it,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nthey'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nand they will feel they made the right decision.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nIt is very difficult\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nto think straight about well-being,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nand I hope I have given you a sense\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nof how difficult it is.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nChris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nThank you so much.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nNow, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nyou mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\ncame out of that Gallup survey.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nIs that something you can share\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nsince you do have a few moments left now?\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nDaniel Kahneman: Sure.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nI think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nis a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nWe found that with respect to the happiness\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nof the experiencing self.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nWhen we looked at how feelings,\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nvary with income.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nAnd it turns out that, below an income\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nof 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nand that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nso it's a large representative sample --\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nbelow an income of 600,000 dollars a year...\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nCA: 60,000.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nDK: 60,000.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:53.958\n60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nand they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nAbove that, we get an absolutely flat line.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nI mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nClearly, what is happening is\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nmoney does not buy you experiential happiness,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nbut lack of money certainly buys you misery,\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nand we can measure that misery\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nvery, very clearly.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nIn terms of the other self, the remembering self,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nyou get a different story.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nThe more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nThat does not hold for emotions.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nCA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nlife, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nIf people took seriously that finding,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nI mean, it seems to turn upside down\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\neverything we believe about, like for example,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\ntaxation policy and so forth.\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nIs there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nwould take a finding like that seriously\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nand run public policy based on it?\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nDK: You know I think that there is recognition\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nof the role of happiness research in public policy.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nThe recognition is going to be slow in the United States,\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nno question about that,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nbut in the U.K., it is happening,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nand in other countries it is happening.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nPeople are recognizing that they ought\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nto be thinking of happiness\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nwhen they think of public policy.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nIt's going to take a while,\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nand people are going to debate\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nwhether they want to study experience happiness,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nor whether they want to study life evaluation,\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nso we need to have that debate fairly soon.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nHow to enhance happiness\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\ngoes very different ways depending on how you think,\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nand whether you think of the remembering self\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nor you think of the experiencing self.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nThis is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nIn the United States, efforts are being made\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nto measure the experience happiness of the population.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nThis is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\npart of national statistics.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nCA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nthe most interesting policy discussion to track\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nover the next few years.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nThank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nThank you, Danny Kahneman."}, {"title": "The rise of cricket, the rise of India", "duration": "1019", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/harsha_bhogle_the_rise_of_cricket_the_rise_of_india", "transcript": "So, what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's \u2014 maybe the world's \u2014 longest running soap opera, which is cricket. And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living. It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want: It's got love, joy, happiness, sadness, tears, laughter, lots of deceit, intrigue. And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes. And that's exactly what cricket has done. It's jumped 20 years into 20-over game. And that's what I'm going to talk about, how a small change leads to a very big revolution.But it wasn't always like that. Cricket wasn't always this speed-driven generations game. There was a time when you played cricket, you played timeless test matches, when you played on till the game got over. And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March. And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town, which is a two-hour train journey, to catch the ship that left on the 17th, because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. So, the match was ended in between. And one of the English batsmen said, \"You know what? Another half an hour and we would have won.\" (Laughter) Another half an hour after 12 days. There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days, so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained, so they all sat around making friends with each other.But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket: because we had about the same pace of life. (Laughter) The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it? You fought by day, then it was sunset, so everyone went back home. And then you worked out your strategy, and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again. The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. Princes patronize the game, not because they love the game, but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers.But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which was, all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball, and any number of people could play it anywhere. Take a look: You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there, you could play it in a little alley \u2014 you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall; don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. (Laughter) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges \u2014 that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. Or you could play many games in one small patch of land, even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. (Laughter) As you can see, you can play anywhere. But slowly the game moved on, you know, finally.You don't always have five days. So, we moved on, and we started playing 50-over cricket. And then an enormous accident took place. In Indian sport we don't make things happen, accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes. And we won this World Cup in 1983. And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game, and we played it virtually every day. There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.But there was another big date. 1983 was when we won the World Cup. 1991,'92, we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India, rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. And so we allowed multinationals into India. We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties, and we got all the multinationals coming in, with multinational budgets, who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India, and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.And there are only two vehicles in India \u2014 one real, one scripted. The scripted one is what you see in the movies, the real one was cricket. And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me, Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it all over the world. And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over. And so cricket started becoming big; cricket started bringing riches in. Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said, \"We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.\" Then they said, \"OK, the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars. The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars.\" So, it's a bit of a curve, that.And then another big accident happened in our cricket. England invented 20 overs cricket, and said, \"The world must play 20 overs cricket.\" Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it. Thank God for them. (Laughter) And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see. India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup. But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin. And then something very dramatic happened. We got to the final, and then this moment, that will remain enshrined forever, for everybody, take a look.(Crowd cheering)The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins! What a match for a Twenty20 final. India, the world champions. (Cheering) India, T20 champions. But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player. A massive, massive success: India, the world TT champions.Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket. The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. (Laughter) If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go, but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. It was at a time when investment was coming in, India was feeling a little more confident about itself. And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. And thankfully for all of us, the English are very good at inventing things, and then the gracious people that they are, they let the world become very good at it. (Laughter) And so England invented T20 cricket, and allowed India to hijack it. It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine, we just took it straight away, as is. (Laughter)And so, we launched our own T20 league. Six weeks, city versus city. It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country \u2014 the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country, representing itself on the field. One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often. The other was Indian cricket. Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues. But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. America is a home of leagues. And they said, \"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.\" But was India ready for it? Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized. It was never promoted, it was never sold \u2014 it was organized. And look what they did with our beautiful, nice, simple family game. All of a sudden, you had that happening.(Music)An opening ceremony to match every other. This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. So, it was a different India. But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern, but didn't want to say that to people. And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.(Music)(Laughter)The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it; these were people who ran serious companies. And so they started promoting cricket big time, started promoting clubs big time. And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled, 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years, and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities, but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues. But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. So, just to give you an example of how they did it \u2014 not Manchester United style promotion, but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.(Music)Of course, a lot of people said, \"Maybe they dance better than they play.\" (Laughter) But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. All along, if you wanted a young cricketer, you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality, your own city, and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot \u2014 if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example, they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them, they could go to Trinidad. This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world, where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world.So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago, overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies, they asked him, \"When do you have to reach?\" He said, \"I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today.\" We said, \"No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave; it's about when do you have to reach there?\" And so he said, \"I've got to reach on date X.\" And they said, \"Fine, you play to date X, minus one.\" So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game, went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport, sat in a private corporate jet \u2014 first refueling in Portugal, second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time. (Laughter) Never would India have thought on this scale before. Never would India have said, \"I want a player to play one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica to play a game.\" And I just thought to myself, \"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know? We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.\"But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket, which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. There is cricket and the movies. And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. And something very interesting happened. We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team \u2014 as you will see on the clip that follows \u2014 if you did well, you got a hug from Preity Zinta. So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look \u2014 everyone's watching Preity Zinta.(Music)And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. We'd all seen matches in Kolkata, but we'd never seen anything like this: Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata \u2014 not for India, but for Kolkata. But take a look at this.(Music)An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. Can you imagine? And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said? (Applause) \"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.\"(Laughter)But I thought I'd take this opportunity \u2014 there's a few people from Pakistan in here. I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right? We can play cricket together, we can be friends. So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.(Applause)There was criticism too because they said, \"Players are being bought and sold? Are they grain? Are they cattle?\" Because we had this auction, you see. How do you fix a price for a player? And so the auction that followed literally had people saying, \"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player.\" There it is.(Music)Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai. Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day \u2014 so 250 rupees for a test match, but if you finish in four days you only got 200. The best Indian players who played every test match \u2014 every one of the internationals, the top of the line players \u2014 standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year. Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work. Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England, he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said, \"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow.\" And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India. Could you have imagined that day would come? One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. That's not bad, is it?So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. What India was doing, though, was benchmarking itself against the best in the world, and it became a huge brand. Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. IPL became the biggest brand in India and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa, and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. But we did it. You know why? Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event, and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.(Applause)Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem, suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching \u2014 the huge consuming class \u2014 everybody came to watch the cricket. We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.Now, this last minute before I go \u2014 there's a couple of side effects of all this. For a long time, India was this country of poverty, dust, beggars, snake charmers, filth, Delhi belly \u2014 people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity. Cricketers all over the world said, \"You know, we love India. We love to play in India.\" And that felt good, you know? We said, \"The dollar's quite powerful actually.\" Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished, everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world. If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game. You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end, or you can't take it all over the world. So that's what T20 is doing. Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.Thank you very much. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 780, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nSo, what I'm going to do is\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:15.958\njust give you the latest episode of India's --\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nmaybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nwhich is cricket.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nAnd may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nIt's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nIt's got love, joy, happiness,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nsadness, tears, laughter,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nlots of deceit, intrigue.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nAnd like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nwhen the audience interest changes.\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd that's exactly what cricket has done.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nIt's jumped 20 years\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\ninto 20-over game.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd that's what I'm going to talk about,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nhow a small change\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nleads to a very big revolution.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nBut it wasn't always like that.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nCricket wasn't always this\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nspeed-driven generations game.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nThere was a time when you played cricket,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nyou played timeless test matches,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nwhen you played on till the game got over.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd there was this game in March 1939\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat started on the third of March\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nand ended on the 14th of March.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nAnd it only ended because the English cricketers\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nhad to go from Durban to Cape Town,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwhich is a two-hour train journey,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nto catch the ship that left on the 17th,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nbecause the next ship wasn't around for a long time.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nSo, the match was ended in between.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd one of the English batsmen said, \"You know what?\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnother half an hour and we would have won.\"\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nAnother half an hour after 12 days.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThere were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nso you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nso they all sat around making friends with each other.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nBut there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbecause we had about the same pace of life.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nThe Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nYou fought by day, then it was sunset,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nso everyone went back home.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd then you worked out your strategy,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThe only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthat in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nPrinces patronize the game,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nnot because they love the game,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nbut because it was a means of ingratiating themselves\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nto the British rulers.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nBut there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nwhich was, all you needed was a plank of wood\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand a rubber ball, and any number of people\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\ncould play it anywhere.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nTake a look:\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nYou could play it in the dump\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwith some rocks over there,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nyou could play it in a little alley --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nyou couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\ndon't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nYou could play it on the banks of the Ganges --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nthat's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nOr you could play many games in one small patch of land,\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\neven if you didn't know which game you were actually in.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAs you can see, you can play anywhere.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nBut slowly the game moved on,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nyou know, finally.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nYou don't always have five days. So, we moved on,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand we started playing 50-over cricket.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nAnd then an enormous accident took place.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nIn Indian sport we don't make things happen,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\naccidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd we won this World Cup in 1983.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nAnd suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand we played it virtually every day.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nThere was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nBut there was another big date.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\n1983 was when we won the World Cup.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\n1991,'92, we found a finance minister\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nand a prime minister\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nwilling to let the world look at India,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nrather than be this great country of intrigue\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand mystery in this closed country.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd so we allowed multinationals into India.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nWe cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand we got all the multinationals coming in,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nwith multinational budgets,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwho looked at per-capita income\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand got very excited about the possibilities in India,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nand were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThe scripted one is what you see in the movies,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthe real one was cricket.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nRavi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nall over the world.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nAnd Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd so cricket started becoming big;\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\ncricket started bringing riches in.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nTelevision started covering cricket. For a long time\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\ntelevision said, \"We won't cover cricket\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nunless you pay us to cover it.\"\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThen they said, \"OK,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthe next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThe next rights are sold for 612 million dollars.\"\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo, it's a bit of a curve, that.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd then another big accident happened in our cricket.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nEngland invented 20 overs cricket,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand said, \"The world must play 20 overs cricket.\"\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nJust as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThank God for them.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIndia didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nBut we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd then something very dramatic happened.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nWe got to the final, and then this moment,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat will remain enshrined forever,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nfor everybody, take a look.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Crowd cheering)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThe Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nAnnouncer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nWhat a match for a Twenty20 final.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nIndia, the world champions.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:08.958\n(Cheering)\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nIndia, T20 champions.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBut what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\ngot it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nA massive, massive success:\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIndia, the world TT champions.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nHarsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nThe accident, of course, there, was that the batsman\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthought the bowler was bowling fast.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nIf he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nbut it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat we could be good at this game.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd what it also did was\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nit led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nIt was at a time when investment was coming in,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nIndia was feeling a little more confident about itself.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd so there was a feeling that there was great pride\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nin what we can do.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nAnd thankfully for all of us,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthe English are very good at inventing things,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand then the gracious people that they are,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nthey let the world become very good at it.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd so England invented T20 cricket,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand allowed India to hijack it.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nwe just took it straight away, as is.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd so, we launched our own T20 league.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSix weeks, city versus city.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIt was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthe only two areas in which India was very proud about\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\ntheir country, representing itself on the field.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nOne was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThe other was Indian cricket.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nNow, suddenly we had to support city leagues.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nBut the people getting into these city leagues\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwere people who were taking their cues from the West.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAmerica is a home of leagues. And they said,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\n\"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nBut was India ready for it?\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBecause cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nIt was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd look what they did with our beautiful, nice,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nsimple family game.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAll of a sudden, you had that happening.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Music)\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAn opening ceremony to match every other.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nThis was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nThis was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nthan New Zealand's population twice over.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nSo, it was a different India.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut it was also a slightly more orthodox India\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nthat was very happy to be modern,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nbut didn't want to say that to people.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nAnd so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nEveryone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n(Music)\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThe new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nThey were not bureaucrats who were forced\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ninto sport because they didn't actually love it;\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthese were people who ran serious companies.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd so they started promoting cricket big time,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nstarted promoting clubs big time.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nI mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nbefore a ball was bowled,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\n1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthat were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbut they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nBut what they were very good at doing\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwas making it very localized.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nSo, just to give you an example of how they did it --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nnot Manchester United style promotion,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbut very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nOf course, a lot of people said, \"Maybe they dance better than they play.\"\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nBut that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAll along, if you wanted a young cricketer,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nyou picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nyour own city, and you were very proud\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof the system that produced those cricketers.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nNow, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nif Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthey needn't go to Kalbadevi\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nor Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nthey could go to Trinidad.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nThis was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nwhere you can source from anywhere\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nas long as you get the best product at the best price.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nthat you can source the best product for the best price\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nanywhere in the world.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\novernight. And when he had to go back to represent\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthe West Indies, they asked him, \"When do you have to reach?\"\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nHe said, \"I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today.\"\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWe said, \"No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nit's about when do you have to reach there?\"\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd so he said, \"I've got to reach on date X.\"\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd they said, \"Fine, you play to date X, minus one.\"\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nSo, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nwent from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nsat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nsecond refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nNever would India have thought on this scale before.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nNever would India have said, \"I want a player to play\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\none game for me, and I will use a corporate jet\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nto play a game.\"\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd I just thought to myself,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\n\"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big.\"\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nBut what this also did was it started\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nmarrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nwhich is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nThere is cricket and the movies.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd they came together because people in the movies\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nnow started owning clubs.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nThey started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd something very interesting happened.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWe started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nas you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nyou got a hug from Preity Zinta.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nSo that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\neveryone's watching Preity Zinta.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\n(Music)\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nWe'd all seen matches in Kolkata,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nbut we'd never seen anything like this:\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nShah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nfor Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nBut take a look at this.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\n(Music)\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAn Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nbecause they'd won in Kolkata.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nCan you imagine?\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\n\"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team.\"\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nBut I thought I'd take this opportunity --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthere's a few people from Pakistan in here.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI'm so happy that you're here\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nbecause I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe can play cricket together, we can be friends.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nSo thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThere was criticism too because they said,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\n\"Players are being bought and sold?\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAre they grain?\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAre they cattle?\"\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nBecause we had this auction, you see.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nHow do you fix a price for a player?\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd so the auction that followed\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nliterally had people saying,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\n\"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player.\"\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThere it is.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n(Music)\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nAuctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars.

From a little club in India.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nCould you have imagined that day would come?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nOne and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nThat's not bad, is it?\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nWhat India was doing, though, was benchmarking\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nitself against the best in the world,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand it became a huge brand.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nLalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nIPL became the biggest brand in India\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nand we had to start the tournament in three weeks.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nMove a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nBut we did it. You know why?\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nBecause no country works as slowly as we do\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\ntill three weeks before an event,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:19.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nOur population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nsuddenly became our biggest asset\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nbecause there were more people watching --\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nthe huge consuming class --\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\neverybody came to watch the cricket.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe'd also made cricket the only sport in India,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nwhich is a pity, but in India every other sport\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\npushes cricket to become big,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nwhich is a bit of a tragedy of our times.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nNow, this last minute before I go --\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nthere's a couple of side effects of all this.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nFor a long time, India was this country of poverty,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\ndust, beggars,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nsnake charmers, filth,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nDelhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nCricketers all over the world said,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\n\"You know, we love India. We love to play in India.\"\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnd that felt good, you know?\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nWe said, \"The dollar's quite powerful actually.\"\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nCan you imagine, you've got the dollar on view\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nThere's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\neverybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nRight so, finally,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nan English game that India usurped a little bit,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nbut T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nIf you want to take the game around the world,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nit's got to be the shortest form of the game.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nYou can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nor you can't take it all over the world.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nSo that's what T20 is doing.\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nHopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nand hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nThank you very much. Thank you.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Is Pivot a turning point for web exploration?", "duration": "385", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_flake_is_pivot_a_turning_point_for_web_exploration", "transcript": "If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts, and instead of thinking about information overload, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age. This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment. It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths \u2014 say, accidents. And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges. This is because, in the mid-area here, people are at their most active, and over here they're at their most frail. We can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death, seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects, but not for everyone. If we go ahead and we filter by age \u2014 say 40 years or less \u2014 we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about. And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.So you get the idea that viewing information, viewing data in this way, is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic. And if we can do this for raw data, why not do it for content as well? So what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced. It's all here; it's all on the web. You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk. With Pivot, you can drill into a decade. You can drill into a particular year. You can jump right into a specific issue. So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue, the sports. I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.(Applause)Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these, I might think, \"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?\" So I can step back, and expand on that. And I see Greg LeMond now. And so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way \u2014 going narrower, broader, backing in, backing out \u2014 you're not searching, you're not browsing. You're doing something that's actually a little bit different. It's in between, and we think it changes the way information can be used.So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit crazy. What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary. So the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from. I'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here. But even in this limited view, we can do a lot of things. Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia. I'm going to go ahead and select government. Now, having selected government, I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year. So this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page. It's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them.Looking at one of these particular summaries, I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year, bringing up all of them. So looking at these people, I can see that the majority come from government; some have come from natural sciences; some, fewer still, have come from business \u2014 there's my boss \u2014 and one has come from music. And interestingly enough, Bono is also a TED Prize winner. So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners. So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page, but at a higher level of abstraction.And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise. I'm just showing the New York Times website here. So Pivot, this application \u2014 I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can view web pages with it \u2014 and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this. So I can step back, pop right back into a specific section. Now the reason why this is important is because, by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way, I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way. So I can drill into what I've done over specific time frames. Here, in fact, is the state of all the demo that I just gave. And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today. And, if I want to step back and look at everything, I can slice and dice my history, perhaps by my search history \u2014 here, I was doing some nepotistic searching, looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot. And from these, I can drill into the web page and just launch them again. It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times, and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data.So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this curse. We talk about the curse of information overload. We talk about drowning in data. What if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down, so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next, we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden? If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data, we might actually extract information. And, instead of dealing just with information, we can tease out knowledge.

I see the athletes\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthat have appeared in this issue, the sports.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nI'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nwhich reveals, for me, all the issues\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nNow, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nI might think,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\n\"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?\"\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo I can step back, and expand on that.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nAnd I see Greg LeMond now.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd so you get the idea that when you\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nnavigate over information this way --\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\ngoing narrower, broader,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nbacking in, backing out --\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nyou're not searching, you're not browsing.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nYou're doing something that's actually a little bit different.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nIt's in between, and we think it changes\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthe way information can be used.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nSo I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nwith something that's a little bit crazy.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nWhat we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand we reduced it down to a little summary.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nSo the summary consists of just a little synopsis\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nI'm only showing the top 500\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nmost popular Wikipedia pages right here.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nBut even in this limited view,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwe can do a lot of things.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nRight away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthat are most popular on Wikipedia.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nI'm going to go ahead and select government.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nNow, having selected government,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nI can now see that the Wikipedia categories\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat most frequently correspond to that\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nare Time magazine People of the Year.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nSo this is really important because this is an insight\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIt's only possible to see that insight\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nwhen you step back and look at all of them.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nLooking at one of these particular summaries,\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nI can then drill into the concept of\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nTime magazine Person of the Year,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nbringing up all of them.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo looking at these people,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nI can see that the majority come from government;\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nsome have come from natural sciences;\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nsome, fewer still, have come from business --\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthere's my boss --\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand one has come from music.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd interestingly enough,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nBono is also a TED Prize winner.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nSo you see, we're navigating the web for the first time\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nas if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nbut at a higher level of abstraction.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd so I want to show you one other thing\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthat may catch you a little bit by surprise.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI'm just showing the New York Times website here.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nSo Pivot, this application --\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nI don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nbut you can view web pages with it --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nand we bring that zoomable technology\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nto every single web page like this.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo I can step back,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\npop right back into a specific section.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nNow the reason why this is important is because,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nby virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nI can look at my entire browsing history\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nin the exact same way.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nSo I can drill into what I've done\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nover specific time frames.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHere, in fact, is the state\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nof all the demo that I just gave.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd, if I want to step back and look at everything,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nI can slice and dice my history,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nperhaps by my search history --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nhere, I was doing some nepotistic searching,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nlooking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAnd from these, I can drill into the web page\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand just launch them again.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nIt's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nand in each case it makes the whole greater\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthan the sum of the parts with the data.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo right now, in this world,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nwe think about data as being this curse.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nWe talk about the curse of information overload.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nWe talk about drowning in data.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nWhat if we can actually turn that upside down\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nand turn the web upside down,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nso that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwe get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand then being able to see the patterns\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nthat were otherwise hidden?\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nIf we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nwe might actually extract information.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd, instead of dealing just with information,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nwe can tease out knowledge.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nSo with that, I thank you.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:11.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Before Avatar ... a curious boy", "duration": "1028", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_cameron_before_avatar_a_curious_boy", "transcript": "I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction. In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school I was out in the woods, hiking and taking \"samples\" \u2014 frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water \u2014 and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope. You know, I was a real science geek. But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility.And my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late '60s, we were going to the moon, we were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. So, that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it.And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head. You know, we all did, as kids having to read a book, and through the author's description, put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook. That was \u2014 the creativity had to find its outlet somehow.And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday \u2014 that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books.So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15. And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo, New York, right across the border from where we live. And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York. And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean, for another two years, until we moved to California.Since then, in the intervening 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 hours of that was in submersibles. And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment, and even the shallow oceans, are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing, and just as strong as it ever was.But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on. So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense. And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories: \"Terminator,\" \"Aliens\" and \"The Abyss.\" And with \"The Abyss,\" I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So, you know, merging the two passions.Something interesting came out of \"The Abyss,\" which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature, we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG. And this resulted in the first soft-surface character, CG animation that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money \u2014 barely broke even, I should say \u2014 I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic.You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought, \"Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art.\" So, with \"Terminator 2,\" which was my next film, we took that much farther. Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude in that film. The success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. And it did, and we created magic again, and we had the same result with an audience \u2014 although we did make a little more money on that one.So, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, \"This is going to be a whole new world,\" this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists. So, I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on, and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. So, I wrote this piece called \"Avatar,\" which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects, of CG effects, beyond, with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG, and the main characters would all be in CG, and the world would be in CG. And the envelope pushed back, and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. (Laughter) You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as \"'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship: \"It's going to be this epic romance, passionate film.\" Secretly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of \"Titanic.\" And that's why I made the movie. (Applause) And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that. But I convinced them. I said, \"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real. We'll be using it in the opening of the film. It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.\" And I talked them into funding an expedition. (Laughter)Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie, not HD \u2014 for real. (Applause)Now, that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission. You know, where it was highly technical, and it required enormous planning. You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. And I thought like, \"Wow. I'm like, living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool.\"And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration. Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it \u2014 it was everything. It was adventure, it was curiosity, it was imagination. And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. As we did some of our subsequent expeditions, I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before, that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them.So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more. And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of \"Titanic,\" I said, \"OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while.\" And so, we started planning these expeditions. And we wound up going to the Bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic. And the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done. Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it.So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played. And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. When I say, \"I'm operating it,\" but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic. And it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship.So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience. And it really made me realize that the telepresence experience \u2014 that you actually can have these robotic avatars, then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence. It was really, really quite profound. And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine, as a science fiction fan.So, having done these expeditions, and really beginning to appreciate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing, amazing animals \u2014 they're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do. And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree-Centigrade water plumes. You think they can't possibly exist.At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well \u2014 again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. And taking them down so that they had access \u2014 astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who were interested in these extreme environments \u2014 taking them down to the vents, and letting them see, and take samples and test instruments, and so on.So, here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science, and actually doing space science. I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real. And you know, along the way in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot. I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot about leadership. Now you think director has got to be a leader, leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to, at a certain point, say, \"What am I doing out here? Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?\" We don't make money at these damn shows. We barely break even. There is no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach. Made all these films, made all these documentary films for a very limited audience.No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? You're doing it for the task itself, for the challenge \u2014 and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is \u2014 for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team. Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people, working for years at a time, sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.And in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say, \"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficulty, the human-performance aspects of working at sea,\" you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.So, when I came back to make my next movie, which was \"Avatar,\" I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So, here I was again with a small team, in uncharted territory, doing \"Avatar,\" coming up with new technology that didn't exist before. Tremendously exciting. Tremendously challenging. And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period. And it completely changed how I do movies. So, people have commented on how, \"Well, you know, you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora.\" To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself, that changed as a result of that.So, what can we synthesize out of all this? You know, what are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, \"Give me some advice for doing this.\" And I say, \"Don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you \u2014 don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself, and take risks.\"NASA has this phrase that they like: \"Failure is not an option.\" But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So, that's the thought I would leave you with, is that in whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is not. Thank you.

I could paint.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd I found that because there weren't video games\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand this saturation of CG movies and all of this\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nimagery in the media landscape,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nI had to create these images in my head.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nYou know, we all did, as kids having to\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nread a book, and through the author's description,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nput something on the movie screen in our heads.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd so, my response to this was to paint, to draw\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nalien creatures, alien worlds,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nrobots, spaceships, all that stuff.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nI was endlessly getting busted in math class\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\ndoodling behind the textbook.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nThat was -- the creativity\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nhad to find its outlet somehow.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nactually got me very excited about the fact that there was\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nan alien world right here on Earth.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI might not really go to an alien world\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\non a spaceship someday --\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nthat seemed pretty darn unlikely.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nBut that was a world I could really go to,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nright here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nas anything that I had imagined\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nfrom reading these books.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nSo, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nat the age of 15.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd the only problem with that was that I lived\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nin a little village in Canada,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\n600 miles from the nearest ocean.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut I didn't let that daunt me.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nI pestered my father until he finally found\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\na scuba class in Buffalo, New York,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nright across the border from where we live.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAnd I actually got certified\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nin a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nin Buffalo, New York.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nAnd I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nfor another two years,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nuntil we moved to California.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nSince then, in the intervening\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\n40 years,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nI've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand 500 hours of that was in submersibles.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand even the shallow oceans,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nare so rich with amazing life\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat really is beyond our imagination.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nNature's imagination is so boundless\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\ncompared to our own\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nmeager human imagination.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI still, to this day, stand in absolute awe\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nof what I see when I make these dives.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nAnd my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand just as strong as it ever was.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nBut when I chose a career as an adult,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nit was filmmaking.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd that seemed to be the best way to reconcile\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nthis urge I had to tell stories\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nwith my urges to create images.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nSo, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\ntogether, and that made sense.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd of course the stories that I chose to tell\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nwere science fiction stories: \"Terminator,\" \"Aliens\"\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand \"The Abyss.\"\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd with \"The Abyss,\" I was putting together my love\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nof underwater and diving with filmmaking.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSo, you know, merging the two passions.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nSomething interesting came out of \"The Abyss,\"\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nwhich was that to solve a specific narrative\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nproblem on that film,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwhich was to create this kind of liquid water creature,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwe actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd this resulted in the first soft-surface\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\ncharacter, CG animation\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nthat was ever in a movie.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd even though the film didn't make any money --\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nbarely broke even, I should say --\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nI witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthe global audience, was mesmerized\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nby this apparent magic.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nYou know, it's Arthur Clarke's law\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThey were seeing something magical.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd so that got me very excited.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nAnd I thought, \"Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\ninto the cinematic art.\"\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo, with \"Terminator 2,\" which was my next film,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwe took that much farther.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nWorking with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nin that film. The success hung in the balance\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\non whether that effect would work.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd it did, and we created magic again,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand we had the same result with an audience --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nalthough we did make a little more money on that one.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, drawing a line through those two dots\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nof experience\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\ncame to, \"This is going to be a whole new world,\"\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthis was a whole new world of creativity\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nfor film artists.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo, I started a company with Stan Winston,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nmy good friend Stan Winston,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwho is the premier make-up and creature designer\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nat that time, and it was called Digital Domain.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd the concept of the company was\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthat we would leapfrog past\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthe analog processes of optical printers and so on,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nand we would go right to digital production.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nAnd we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nBut we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nin the creature and character design stuff\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat we had actually founded the company to do.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nSo, I wrote this piece called \"Avatar,\"\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nwhich was meant to absolutely push the envelope\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nof visual effects,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nof CG effects, beyond,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nwith realistic human emotive characters\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\ngenerated in CG,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand the main characters would all be in CG,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand the world would be in CG.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd the envelope pushed back,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nand I was told by the folks at my company\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nYou know, I went and pitched it to the studio as \"'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\n\"It's going to be this epic romance,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\npassionate film.\"\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSecretly, what I wanted to do was\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI wanted to dive to the real wreck of \"Titanic.\"\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAnd that's why I made the movie.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut I convinced them. I said,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\n\"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nWe'll be using it in the opening of the film.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nIt will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd I talked them into funding an expedition.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nabout your imagination creating a reality.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nBecause we actually created a reality where six months later,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nI find myself in a Russian submersible\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\ntwo and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nlooking at the real Titanic through a view port.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nNot a movie, not HD -- for real.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nNow, that blew my mind.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand lights and all kinds of things.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nBut, it struck me how much\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthis dive, these deep dives,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwas like a space mission.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nYou know, where it was highly technical,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand it required enormous planning.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nYou get in this capsule, you go down to this dark\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nhostile environment\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwhere there is no hope of rescue\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nif you can't get back by yourself.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nAnd I thought like, \"Wow. I'm like,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nliving in a science fiction movie.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThis is really cool.\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nAnd so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nOf course, the curiosity, the science component of it --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nit was everything. It was adventure,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nit was curiosity, it was imagination.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nAnd it was an experience that\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nHollywood couldn't give me.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nBecause, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\ncreate a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nout that window.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nAs we did some of our subsequent expeditions,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nI was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand sometimes things that I had never seen before,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nsometimes things that no one had seen before,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nthat actually were not described by science\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nat the time that we saw them and imaged them.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo, I was completely smitten by this,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nand had to do more.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nAnd so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAfter the success of \"Titanic,\"\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nI said, \"OK, I'm going to park my day job\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nas a Hollywood movie maker,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while.\"\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd so, we started planning these\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nexpeditions.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd we wound up going to the Bismark,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand exploring it with robotic vehicles.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nWe went back to the Titanic wreck.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nWe took little bots that we had created\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthat spooled a fiber optic.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nAnd the idea was to go in and do an interior\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nsurvey of that ship, which had never been done.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nNobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nso we created technology to do it.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo, you know, here I am now, on the deck\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nof Titanic, sitting in a submersible,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand looking out at planks that look much like this,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwhere I knew that the band had played.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nAnd I'm flying a little robotic vehicle\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nthrough the corridor of the ship.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nWhen I say, \"I'm operating it,\"\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbut my mind is in the vehicle.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nI felt like I was physically present\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\ninside the shipwreck of Titanic.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nAnd it was the most surreal kind\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nof deja vu experience I've ever had,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause I would know before I turned a corner\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nwhat was going to be there before the lights\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nof the vehicle actually revealed it,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbecause I had walked the set for months\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nwhen we were making the movie.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd the set was based as an exact replica\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\non the blueprints of the ship.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nSo, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd it really made me realize that\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nthe telepresence experience --\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat you actually can have these robotic avatars,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nthen your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\ninto this other form of existence.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nIt was really, really quite profound.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nsome decades out\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nas we start to have cyborg bodies\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nfor exploration or for other means\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nin many sort of\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\npost-human futures\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nthat I can imagine,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nas a science fiction fan.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nSo, having done these expeditions,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand really beginning to appreciate what was down there,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nsuch as at the deep ocean vents\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nwhere we had these amazing, amazing animals --\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthey're basically aliens right here on Earth.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThey live in an environment of chemosynthesis.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nThey don't survive on sunlight-based\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nsystem the way we do.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd so, you're seeing animals that are living next to\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\na 500-degree-Centigrade\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nwater plumes.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nYou think they can't possibly exist.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAt the same time\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI was getting very interested in space science as well --\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nagain, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd I wound up getting involved with\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthe space community,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nreally involved with NASA,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nsitting on the NASA advisory board,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nplanning actual space missions,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\ngoing to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nbiomedical protocols,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nand all these sorts of things,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nto actually go and fly to the international space station\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwith our 3D camera systems.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd this was fascinating.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nBut what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwith us into the deep.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nAnd taking them down so that they had access --\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nastrobiologists, planetary scientists,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\npeople who were interested in these extreme environments --\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\ntaking them down to the vents, and letting them see,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nand take samples and test instruments, and so on.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nSo, here we were making documentary films,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbut actually doing science,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand actually doing space science.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nI'd completely closed the loop\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbetween being the science fiction fan,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nyou know, as a kid,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand doing this stuff for real.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nAnd you know, along the way in this journey\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nof discovery,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nI learned a lot.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nI learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nabout leadership.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nNow you think director has got to be a leader,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nleader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nI didn't really learn about leadership\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nuntil I did these expeditions.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBecause I had to, at a certain point, say,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\n\"What am I doing out here?\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nWhy am I doing this?

Chu. And I'm not a dancer, I'm not a choreographer \u2014 I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller. I directed a movie two years ago called \"Step Up 2: The Streets.\" Anybody? Anybody? Yeah! During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers \u2014 amazing, the best in the world \u2014 and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind. I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities. They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back. They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row. I'd never seen anything like that.When I was growing up, my heroes were people like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson. I grew up in a musical family. (Laughter) And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes. Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger. Those guys made me want to, like, \"I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl.\"(Applause)And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared, sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos. But after seeing what I've seen, the truth is, they have not disappeared at all. They're here, getting better and better every day. And dance has progressed. It is insane what dance is right now. Dance has never had a better friend than technology.Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit, building on it within days and releasing a new video, while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself. And this is happening every day.And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow. Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips, and may not have that opportunity, except for us.So, we created the LXD, sort of a \u2014 the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers, a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world. A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it. And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you, some of our heroes right now. We got Madd Chadd, Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth. Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream. Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.(Applause)(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me, I get a lot of different reactions actually. Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out. And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.(Music)(Applause)J Smooth: When I'm in the zone \u2014 I'm dancing and free styling it \u2014 I actually visually kind of picture lines, and moving them. I think of like, Transformers, like how panels open and then they fold, they fold in, and then you close that panel. And then another thing opens, you close that.(Music)(Applause)Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing. Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music. It's not really a conscious decision, \"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this.\" It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore, and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. I got my name just because I was so young. I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with. So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.(Music)(Applause)L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy. And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move. That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out, you throw it out, and you hold it. And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in. And you just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating it. You know, you create power, then you tame it.(Music)(Applause)(Music)(Applause)", "id": 786, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\n(Music)\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nI'm Jon M.

I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nSo, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n(Music)\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nL'il C: I tell them to create a ball,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nand then you just use that ball of energy.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd instead of throwing it out, people would think\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nthat's a krump move, that's a krump move.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nThat's not a krump move.

And if your life isn't like that, I'd like to humbly suggest that you're wasting your life. A life is too short to be wasted.So what I propose to do in the next 17 minutes \u2014 I've used up one minute already \u2014 is to give you a set of powerful tools which can get you started on being there. Is that of interest to you?Audience: Yes.Srikumar Rao: OK.This is a conference on happiness, but even if it wasn't a conference on happiness, would it be right if I said that in some way, shape, fashion or form, you're devoting your entire life to being happy? Everything you do \u2014 your job, family, children, relationships, whatever \u2014 is a quest for happiness. Correct?I'd like you to think about the following: What do you have to get in order to be happy? We're just going to spend a minute on this. What do you have to get in order to be happy?Anybody, quick?When I conduct this experiment, a bunch of stuff comes up: vast wealth, trophy spouse, good health, lots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc. Right now, if you were to think about it, you probably have a list of, \"Here's what I need to get in order to be happy.\" I would like you to consider this: anything that you can get \u2014 let me repeat that \u2014 anything you can get, you can un-get. Is that correct? So, vast wealth can make you happy. Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow. A number of people in the financial sector have discovered this already. So whatever you get that can make you happy can go away. Where does that leave you? Not a very nice place, right?I have a different proposition to suggest to you. What I have to suggest to you is that there is nothing that you have to get, do or be in order to be happy. Let me repeat that: there is nothing that you have to get, do or be in order to be happy. In fact, happiness is your innate nature. It is hardwired into you. It is part of your DNA. You cannot not be happy.Now, all of you are very polite, and in some of the other forums I speak in, such as top business schools, they're not so polite. And invariably, somebody articulates what many of you are thinking, which is: \"If happiness is my innate nature, how come I am not experiencing it? How come I am experiencing my life sucks?\"(Laughter)And the answer to that is actually very simple. You have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. Let me repeat that: you have spent your entire life learning to be unhappy. And the way we learn to be unhappy is by buying into a particular mental model.A mental model is a notion we have that this is the way the world works. All of us have mental models, we've got dozens of mental models. We've got mental models on how to find a job, how to get ahead at work, how to pick a restaurant to eat at, how to have a movie to go to ... dozens of them. The problem isn't that we have mental models. The problem is that we don't know that we have mental models. We think this is the way the world works. And the more we invest in a mental model, the more it appears that this, in fact, is the way the world works. But it isn't: it's just a mental model, and the mental model we have that we buy into so strongly is that we have to get something so we can do something so we can be something. Like, we have to get a great deal of money so we can travel to exotic places so we can be happy. We have to be in a relationship so we can have great sex so we can be happy.All of this is a variation of the if-then model. And the if-then model is: if this happens, then we will be happy. If I were to get a better job, if I were to get more money, if my boss would have a heart attack, if only I was married, if only my wife would leave me \u2014(Laughter)if only I had children, if my children would grow up and go to college ... It doesn't matter what it is. The whole notion is if this happens, then I will be happy.And right now, the only thing that's different between the persons in this audience is what is the particular \"if\" that you are focusing on? And the only thing that's different between you now and where you were 10 years ago is what is the particular \"if\" that you were focusing on? Think about your life 10 years ago. Spend a minute doing that. Ten years ago, if you remember clearly, there were certain things you wanted. Is that correct? Odds are pretty good that many of those things you wanted 10 years ago you now have. Is that correct? Where has that left you? In exactly the same place, right?What we don't realize is the model itself is flawed. The if-then model \u2014 \"If this happens I will be happy\" \u2014 the model itself is flawed. But instead of recognizing that it is the model itself that's flawed, what we do is spend enormous amounts of time changing the \"if.\" \"Oh, well, I thought if I became CEO it would help, but now I realize it's not that I want to become a CEO. I want to become the billionaire CEO, and then I will be happy.\" You've got your own variation on that. But it's the model itself that's flawed, not what you put on the \"if\" side of the equation. I can demonstrate that to you.Can any of you recall a time when you were confronted with a scene of such spectacular beauty that it took you outside of yourself into a place of great serenity? Maybe a rainbow, a mountain range, a valley, the sea. And if you remember that \u2014 raise your hands if you could. Virtually all of you could, right? Have you ever wondered why that happened? The reason that happened is that somehow, for some reason, at that instant, you accepted the universe exactly as it was. You didn't say, \"That's a beautiful rainbow, but it's kind of off to the left, and if I could move it 200 yards to the right, it would be ever so much more beautiful.\"(Laughter)You didn't say, \"That's a beautiful valley, but the tree in the foreground has too many crooked branches. So if you gave me a chainsaw and 20 minutes, I'd make it ever so much better.\"Oh no, the rainbow off-center was just fine. The tree with its crooked branches was just fine. And the moment you accepted the universe just as it was, your habitual-wanting self dropped away, and the happiness which is your innate nature surfaced, and you felt it. And I know you felt it because now, even now after all those years, you can still remember it.The problem is that your life right now, with all of the problems that you have \u2014 more precisely, all of the problems that you think you have \u2014 is equally perfect. But you do not accept it. In fact, you're spending all your time striving with might and main to make it different. You are not accepting it. And when you're not accepting it, you're buying into the if-then model: if this happens, then I will be happy. And it's the model itself that is flawed.So let me show you how you can get out of that, or at least you can begin the steps towards getting out of that. I'd like to share with you that action. We all live our lives because we want to achieve something, correct? You know, we are here and we want to have something. Alex wants to have a successful conference. You know, many of you want to have great programs for your companies that are very successful. You want to progress, have more money, all of that, is that correct? Each of those is an outcome; you would like something to happen.Now, I'd like you to think about the following: actions are within your control, not entirely, but to a large extent. The outcome is completely out of your control. OK? Actions are within your control. The outcome is completely outside your control.Have any of you recognized that when you have a goal and you start to work towards it, some of the time you don't achieve your goal, and some of the time what you get is the exact opposite of what you wanted? Has that happened to any of you?Like there was a friend of mine who said, \"Gee, you know, I have not been paying a lot of attention to my wife, and this has to change.\" So the next time we went on a business trip, he bought a very expensive dress for her. And this was his way of showing, you know, I care for you, and nice things would happen. And when he presented the gift to his wife, her immediate reaction was, \"After 20 years of marriage, you don't know my size?\"(Laughter)\"And furthermore, don't you know I never wear this kind of thing?\" And the next thing you know, he had a full-blown marital spat. Has that happened to any of you? You've taken action for a particular outcome and the outcome you got was the exact opposite of what you wanted? Happens all the time.Well, we live in a world where what we think of, what we invest in, is the outcome. We define our life in the following way: here I am, here is where I want to go, these are the steps I have to take in order to get from where I am to where I want to go, and if I succeed, life is wonderful. And if I don't, then I have failed, life is no good, life sucks. True? False? That is how we live. We invest in the outcome, and as I've just pointed out, the outcome is frequently different from what we would like, and sometimes the diametric opposite of what we would like. You invest in the outcome and you are guaranteed to have more than your share of frustration, angst and all the rest of the stuff that makes life suck.There is an alternative. And the alternative is that you do not invest in the outcome, you invest in the process. And the best way to describe that is a quote by John Wooden. I don't know how many of you are familiar with John Wooden. He's very well-known in the United States and certainly among basketball fans. He's the only person ever to make the basketball Hall of Fame both as a player and as a coach. And what he told his entering team \u2014 he led UCLA to an unprecedented number of victories and finals in the NCAA \u2014 and what he used to tell any new team is he never spoke about winning. He always said, \"When it's over and you look in the mirror, did you do the best that you were capable of? And if you did the best that you were capable of, the score doesn't matter. But I would suspect that if you did the best that you were capable of, you will find the score to your liking.\" That is investing in a process.What we do is the exact opposite. We invest in the outcome. This is what I want \u2014 oh, I want it so desperately, because if I get it I will be happy. And you try with might and main, to do whatever you can, but you are always focusing on, \"This is the outcome.\" Now, focusing on the outcome is fine. It gives you direction. Investing in the outcome means that you make the achievement of a particular outcome dependent for your well-being. And that is a surefire recipe for failure.What you can do is something else. You can invest in the process. That is, once you have determined, here is where I am, here is where I want to be, and that's fine, you focus on the outcome only to the extent that it gives you direction, and then you invest yourself completely in the process. You say, here are the steps you want to take, and you put everything into it. And if you succeed, wonderful. And if you don't succeed, still wonderful, because now you have a new starting point, and from that new starting point, you select another outcome and keep going. And when you do that, you will find that every day is a blast.Let me give you an example. And if you have children \u2014 raise your hands if you have children. Have you ever seen a small child learn to walk? What happens, and this happens typically between 11 and 13 months, is the child gets up and she sees everybody walking, she wants to walk, she gets up, she falls down, she starts crying and momma runs up and comforts her, kisses the place, makes it well. She tries again, falls down, mommy runs up again. After some time, mommy feels tired and no longer runs up and the child stops crying, and then she gets up, takes a step and doesn't fall down, and then she takes another, and a beautiful smile comes on her face. And very soon, generally within 24 hours, she's walking all over the place, upsetting your living room arrangements. And you know you've gone to a new stage of parenting. Right?Now, imagine what would happen if each time the child fell, she would say, \"Oh my God, I failed again. I'm never going to learn to walk.\" And you have to get counseling for her to help her deal with feelings of inadequacy and not being able to achieve and fail yet again. How long do you think it would take her to learn to walk if you had to do that, if every three times she fell down, you had to get a counselor to counsel her and so on? Sounds funny, doesn't it? But that is exactly what we're doing. What the child is doing is focusing on the process. She's investing in the process, not in the outcome.What we do is the exact opposite. As we grow up, we lose the ability to invest in the process, we start investing in the outcome. By definition the outcome is outside of our control, and if that's where we spend all of our emotional energy, we are going to get drained as we do.But if, on the other hand, we said, \"Here is the outcome, I am going to invest in the process and give it every single bit I could,\" every day is a blast, and you're well on your way to achieving the vision that I outlined to you.The question that I get all the time, is people say, \"Professor Rao, but nothing makes me passionate.\" So I say, \"OK, what would?\" And they invariably come up with, you know, here is a list of things. Here's my job and here's how much it pays, this is the kind of person my boss is, the kind of people my colleagues are, and here's how my customers are, here's how much I travel, here's how big my office is, how deep the carpeting is, how many windows I have \u2014 a bunch of parameters.And what I tell them is what I want to share with you, because all of that stuff \u2014 first of all, it doesn't exist. But second, even if it did and you were plugged into it, it would not take more than six months for you to be the same sorry, miserable self there as you are now, because passion exists inside you. It does not exist in the job. And if you don't find a way to ignite it within you right where you are, you are not going to find it outside. But if you do find a way to ignite it where you are, then you will find that the external world rearranges itself to accommodate the new person that you are becoming. And as you do that, you will find that miracles happen on a regular basis. Persons come up whom you're delighted to meet. New people enter your life. It's just a breeze, because all you do in your life is you take journeys.You came here to this conference; you went on a journey. You hang around the water cooler, talking about how terrible your place of work is; you went on a journey. You watch \"Desperate Housewives,\" you go on a journey. You go on a journey where 40-something women are having affairs with 19-something gardeners while the husbands are playing around with models. All you do is go on journeys. There's nothing wrong with that, but just ask yourself, \"Is this a journey I want to take? Does this take me to a place I want to spend time?\"And if you start doing that, you will find that your life changes. The kind of people you meet, the things you talk about, the movies you go to, the books you read \u2014 everything changes. And you begin all of that by focusing on the process.Invest in the process, not in the outcome.Thank you.", "id": 787, "subtitle":

00:00:26.282\nand doing what you do;\n\n00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:27.838\nthat as you go through the day,\n\n00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:31.345\nyou can literally sink\nto your knees in gratitude\n\n00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.500\nat the tremendous good fortune\nthat's been bestowed on you;\n\n00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:37.065\nthat as you go through the day,\n\n00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.692\nyou become radiantly alive several times.\n\n00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:46.359\nAnd if your life isn't like that,\n\n00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:50.134\nI'd like to humbly suggest\nthat you're wasting your life.\n\n00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:52.642\nA life is too short to be wasted.\n\n00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:57.032\nSo what I propose to do\nin the next 17 minutes --\n\n00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.047\nI've used up one minute already --\n\n00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.531\nis to give you a set of powerful tools\n\n00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:06.459\nwhich can get you started on being there.\n\n00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.777\nIs that of interest to you?\n\n00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.952\nAudience: Yes.\n\n00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:10.131\nSrikumar Rao: OK.\n\n00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:12.050\nThis is a conference on happiness,\n\n00:01:12.074 --> 00:01:14.609\nbut even if it wasn't\na conference on happiness,\n\n00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:19.734\nwould it be right if I said\nthat in some way, shape, fashion or form,\n\n00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:21.963\nyou're devoting your entire life\n\n00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:23.163\nto being happy?\n\n00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:28.348\nEverything you do -- your job, family,\nchildren, relationships, whatever --\n\n00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:30.534\nis a quest for happiness.\n\n00:01:30.558 --> 00:01:31.889\nCorrect?\n\n00:01:31.913 --> 00:01:34.067\nI'd like you to think about the following:\n\n00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.867\nWhat do you have to get\n\n00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.392\nin order to be happy?\n\n00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:43.511\nWe're just going to spend\na minute on this.\n\n00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.440\nWhat do you have to get\nin order to be happy?\n\n00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:49.519\nAnybody, quick?\n\n00:01:50.352 --> 00:01:53.367\nWhen I conduct this experiment,\na bunch of stuff comes up:\n\n00:01:53.391 --> 00:02:00.385\nvast wealth, trophy spouse, good health,\nlots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc.\n\n00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.875\nRight now, if you were to think about it,\n\n00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.542\nyou probably have a list\nof, \"Here's what I need to get\n\n00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:06.993\nin order to be happy.\"\n\n00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:10.361\nI would like you to consider this:\n\n00:02:10.385 --> 00:02:12.328\nanything that you can get --\n\n00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:16.115\nlet me repeat that -- anything\nyou can get, you can un-get.\n\n00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.289\nIs that correct?\n\n00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.798\nSo, vast wealth can make you happy.\nVast wealth can disappear tomorrow.\n\n00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:25.658\nA number of people in the financial sector\nhave discovered this already.\n\n00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:30.048\nSo whatever you get\nthat can make you happy\n\n00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:31.223\ncan go away.\n\n00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:32.508\nWhere does that leave you?\n\n00:02:33.563 --> 00:02:35.103\nNot a very nice place, right?\n\n00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:38.344\nI have a different proposition\nto suggest to you.\n\n00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:39.891\nWhat I have to suggest to you\n\n00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:44.390\nis that there is nothing\nthat you have to get, do or be\n\n00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.717\nin order to be happy.\n\n00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.383\nLet me repeat that:\n\n00:02:47.407 --> 00:02:51.516\nthere is nothing that you have to get,\ndo or be in order to be happy.\n\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.638\nIn fact, happiness is your innate nature.\n\n00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:58.383\nIt is hardwired into you.\nIt is part of your DNA.\n\n00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.192\nYou cannot not be happy.\n\n00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.640\nNow, all of you are very polite,\n\n00:03:03.664 --> 00:03:08.123\nand in some of the other forums\nI speak in, such as top business schools,\n\n00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:09.609\nthey're not so polite.\n\n00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:13.552\nAnd invariably, somebody articulates\nwhat many of you are thinking,\n\n00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:17.159\nwhich is: \"If happiness\nis my innate nature,\n\n00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:19.477\nhow come I am not experiencing it?\n\n00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:22.724\nHow come I am experiencing my life sucks?\"\n\n00:03:22.748 --> 00:03:24.790\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:27.845\nAnd the answer to that\nis actually very simple.\n\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.561\nYou have spent your entire life\n\n00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:35.182\nlearning to be unhappy.\n\n00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:42.186\nLet me repeat that: you have spent\nyour entire life learning to be unhappy.\n\n00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.212\nAnd the way we learn to be unhappy\n\n00:03:45.236 --> 00:03:48.304\nis by buying into\na particular mental model.\n\n00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:51.755\nA mental model is a notion we have\nthat this is the way the world works.\n\n00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.823\nAll of us have mental models,\nwe've got dozens of mental models.\n\n00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:57.240\nWe've got mental models\non how to find a job,\n\n00:03:57.264 --> 00:04:00.165\nhow to get ahead at work,\nhow to pick a restaurant to eat at,\n\n00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.253\nhow to have a movie\nto go to ... dozens of them.\n\n00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:05.427\nThe problem isn't\nthat we have mental models.\n\n00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:08.613\nThe problem is that we don't know\nthat we have mental models.\n\n00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:10.843\nWe think this is the way the world works.\n\n00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:12.827\nAnd the more we invest in a mental model,\n\n00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.616\nthe more it appears that this, in fact,\nis the way the world works.\n\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.863\nBut it isn't: it's just a mental model,\n\n00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:22.526\nand the mental model we have\nthat we buy into so strongly\n\n00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.427\nis that we have to get something\nso we can do something\n\n00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:27.979\nso we can be something.\n\n00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:31.861\nLike, we have to get a great deal of money\nso we can travel to exotic places\n\n00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:33.145\nso we can be happy.\n\n00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.376\nWe have to be in a relationship\nso we can have great sex\n\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.660\nso we can be happy.\n\n00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:44.253\nAll of this is a variation\nof the if-then model.\n\n00:04:44.277 --> 00:04:46.287\nAnd the if-then model is:\n\n00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:47.896\nif this happens,\n\n00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:50.412\nthen we will be happy.\n\n00:04:52.155 --> 00:04:55.338\nIf I were to get a better job,\nif I were to get more money,\n\n00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.546\nif my boss would have a heart attack,\n\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.222\nif only I was married,\nif only my wife would leave me --\n\n00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:04.423\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:05.956\nif only I had children,\n\n00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.794\nif my children would grow up\nand go to college ...\n\n00:05:09.654 --> 00:05:11.350\nIt doesn't matter what it is.\n\n00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:14.168\nThe whole notion is if this happens,\n\n00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.564\nthen I will be happy.\n\n00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:20.132\nAnd right now, the only thing\nthat's different\n\n00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:23.076\nbetween the persons in this audience\n\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.653\nis what is the particular \"if\"\nthat you are focusing on?\n\n00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:28.400\nAnd the only thing that's different\n\n00:05:28.424 --> 00:05:31.000\nbetween you now\nand where you were 10 years ago\n\n00:05:31.024 --> 00:05:34.024\nis what is the particular \"if\"\nthat you were focusing on?\n\n00:05:34.737 --> 00:05:37.059\nThink about your life 10 years ago.\n\n00:05:37.715 --> 00:05:39.073\nSpend a minute doing that.\n\n00:05:39.962 --> 00:05:42.090\nTen years ago, if you remember clearly,\n\n00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:43.892\nthere were certain things you wanted.\n\n00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:45.066\nIs that correct?\n\n00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:47.122\nOdds are pretty good\n\n00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:50.249\nthat many of those things you wanted\n10 years ago you now have.\n\n00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:51.423\nIs that correct?\n\n00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:54.133\nWhere has that left you?\n\n00:05:56.662 --> 00:05:59.075\nIn exactly the same place, right?\n\n00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:03.842\nWhat we don't realize\nis the model itself is flawed.\n\n00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:06.860\nThe if-then model --\n\"If this happens I will be happy\" --\n\n00:06:06.884 --> 00:06:08.928\nthe model itself is flawed.\n\n00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.488\nBut instead of recognizing\nthat it is the model itself that's flawed,\n\n00:06:13.512 --> 00:06:17.024\nwhat we do is spend\nenormous amounts of time\n\n00:06:17.048 --> 00:06:18.792\nchanging the \"if.\"\n\n00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:22.887\n\"Oh, well, I thought if I became\nCEO it would help,\n\n00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.554\nbut now I realize it's not\nthat I want to become a CEO.\n\n00:06:25.578 --> 00:06:27.997\nI want to become the billionaire CEO,\n\n00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.610\nand then I will be happy.\"\n\n00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:32.435\nYou've got your own variation on that.\n\n00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:37.116\nBut it's the model itself that's flawed,\nnot what you put on the \"if\" side\n\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.307\nof the equation.\n\n00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:40.876\nI can demonstrate that to you.\n\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.441\nCan any of you recall a time\n\n00:06:42.465 --> 00:06:47.001\nwhen you were confronted with a scene\nof such spectacular beauty\n\n00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:51.640\nthat it took you outside of yourself\ninto a place of great serenity?\n\n00:06:52.224 --> 00:06:54.848\nMaybe a rainbow, a mountain range,\n\n00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.570\na valley, the sea.\n\n00:06:56.594 --> 00:06:59.418\nAnd if you remember that --\nraise your hands if you could.\n\n00:06:59.918 --> 00:07:01.561\nVirtually all of you could, right?\n\n00:07:01.585 --> 00:07:04.033\nHave you ever wondered why that happened?\n\n00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:07.665\nThe reason that happened is that somehow,\n\n00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:09.848\nfor some reason,\n\n00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:11.983\nat that instant,\n\n00:07:13.115 --> 00:07:17.615\nyou accepted the universe\nexactly as it was.\n\n00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:19.797\nYou didn't say,\n\n00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:22.757\n\"That's a beautiful rainbow,\nbut it's kind of off to the left,\n\n00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:25.174\nand if I could move it\n200 yards to the right,\n\n00:07:25.198 --> 00:07:27.349\nit would be ever so much more beautiful.\"\n\n00:07:27.373 --> 00:07:29.100\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:31.595\nYou didn't say,\n\"That's a beautiful valley,\n\n00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.611\nbut the tree in the foreground\nhas too many crooked branches.\n\n00:07:34.635 --> 00:07:36.906\nSo if you gave me\na chainsaw and 20 minutes,\n\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.573\nI'd make it ever so much better.\"\n\n00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:40.590\nOh no, the rainbow off-center\n\n00:07:40.614 --> 00:07:41.772\nwas just fine.\n\n00:07:41.796 --> 00:07:43.438\nThe tree with its crooked branches\n\n00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:44.746\nwas just fine.\n\n00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.443\nAnd the moment you accepted\nthe universe just as it was,\n\n00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:52.982\nyour habitual-wanting self dropped away,\n\n00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:56.261\nand the happiness which is\nyour innate nature surfaced,\n\n00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:57.443\nand you felt it.\n\n00:07:57.947 --> 00:08:00.107\nAnd I know you felt it because now,\n\n00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.476\neven now after all those years,\n\n00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.562\nyou can still remember it.\n\n00:08:06.077 --> 00:08:09.045\nThe problem is that your life right now,\n\n00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:11.633\nwith all of the problems that you have --\n\n00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:16.173\nmore precisely, all of the problems\nthat you think you have --\n\n00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.031\nis equally perfect.\n\n00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:21.405\nBut you do not accept it.\n\n00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:24.328\nIn fact, you're spending all your time\n\n00:08:24.352 --> 00:08:28.540\nstriving with might and main\nto make it different.\n\n00:08:28.564 --> 00:08:30.499\nYou are not accepting it.\n\n00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.304\nAnd when you're not accepting it,\n\n00:08:33.328 --> 00:08:35.359\nyou're buying into the if-then model:\n\n00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:38.449\nif this happens, then I will be happy.\n\n00:08:38.473 --> 00:08:41.491\nAnd it's the model itself that is flawed.\n\n00:08:43.118 --> 00:08:45.428\nSo let me show you how\nyou can get out of that,\n\n00:08:45.452 --> 00:08:48.924\nor at least you can begin the steps\ntowards getting out of that.\n\n00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:52.241\nI'd like to share with you that action.\n\n00:08:52.734 --> 00:08:55.980\nWe all live our lives because we want\nto achieve something, correct?\n\n00:08:56.004 --> 00:08:58.572\nYou know, we are here\nand we want to have something.\n\n00:08:58.935 --> 00:09:01.469\nAlex wants to have\na successful conference.\n\n00:09:01.493 --> 00:09:05.198\nYou know, many of you want to have\ngreat programs for your companies\n\n00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:06.712\nthat are very successful.\n\n00:09:06.736 --> 00:09:09.927\nYou want to progress, have more money,\nall of that, is that correct?\n\n00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:16.985\nEach of those is an outcome;\nyou would like something to happen.\n\n00:09:17.874 --> 00:09:20.091\nNow, I'd like you to think\nabout the following:\n\n00:09:20.115 --> 00:09:21.988\nactions are within your control,\n\n00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:23.900\nnot entirely, but to a large extent.\n\n00:09:24.401 --> 00:09:26.987\nThe outcome is completely\nout of your control.\n\n00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.722\nOK?\n\n00:09:28.746 --> 00:09:30.438\nActions are within your control.\n\n00:09:30.462 --> 00:09:32.695\nThe outcome is completely\noutside your control.\n\n00:09:32.719 --> 00:09:35.180\nHave any of you recognized\nthat when you have a goal\n\n00:09:35.204 --> 00:09:37.218\nand you start to work towards it,\n\n00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:39.540\nsome of the time\nyou don't achieve your goal,\n\n00:09:39.564 --> 00:09:41.287\nand some of the time what you get\n\n00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.662\nis the exact opposite of what you wanted?\n\n00:09:43.686 --> 00:09:45.479\nHas that happened to any of you?\n\n00:09:46.132 --> 00:09:49.623\nLike there was a friend of mine\nwho said, \"Gee, you know,\n\n00:09:49.647 --> 00:09:53.273\nI have not been paying\na lot of attention to my wife,\n\n00:09:53.297 --> 00:09:54.481\nand this has to change.\"\n\n00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:56.576\nSo the next time\nwe went on a business trip,\n\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.121\nhe bought a very expensive dress for her.\n\n00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:02.682\nAnd this was his way of showing,\nyou know, I care for you,\n\n00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:04.643\nand nice things would happen.\n\n00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:08.690\nAnd when he presented the gift\nto his wife, her immediate reaction was,\n\n00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:12.900\n\"After 20 years of marriage,\nyou don't know my size?\"\n\n00:10:12.924 --> 00:10:14.185\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:18.924\n\"And furthermore, don't you know\nI never wear this kind of thing?\"\n\n00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:23.054\nAnd the next thing you know,\nhe had a full-blown marital spat.\n\n00:10:23.078 --> 00:10:24.718\nHas that happened to any of you?\n\n00:10:24.742 --> 00:10:27.535\nYou've taken action\nfor a particular outcome\n\n00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:29.735\nand the outcome you got\nwas the exact opposite\n\n00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:31.243\nof what you wanted?\n\n00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:32.651\nHappens all the time.\n\n00:10:33.143 --> 00:10:37.573\nWell, we live in a world\nwhere what we think of,\n\n00:10:37.597 --> 00:10:39.019\nwhat we invest in,\n\n00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:40.471\nis the outcome.\n\n00:10:40.897 --> 00:10:42.842\nWe define our life in the following way:\n\n00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:44.910\nhere I am, here is where I want to go,\n\n00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:48.053\nthese are the steps I have to take\nin order to get from where I am\n\n00:10:48.077 --> 00:10:49.259\nto where I want to go,\n\n00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:51.808\nand if I succeed, life is wonderful.\n\n00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:56.625\nAnd if I don't, then I have failed,\n\n00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:59.130\nlife is no good, life sucks.\n\n00:11:00.263 --> 00:11:01.527\nTrue? False?\n\n00:11:02.106 --> 00:11:03.654\nThat is how we live.\n\n00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:05.849\nWe invest in the outcome,\n\n00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:07.773\nand as I've just pointed out,\n\n00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:11.123\nthe outcome is frequently different\nfrom what we would like,\n\n00:11:11.147 --> 00:11:14.502\nand sometimes the diametric opposite\nof what we would like.\n\n00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:18.681\nYou invest in the outcome\nand you are guaranteed to have\n\n00:11:18.705 --> 00:11:20.835\nmore than your share of frustration, angst\n\n00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:23.479\nand all the rest of the stuff\nthat makes life suck.\n\n00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:25.510\nThere is an alternative.\n\n00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:29.862\nAnd the alternative is that you do not\ninvest in the outcome,\n\n00:11:29.886 --> 00:11:32.566\nyou invest in the process.\n\n00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:37.675\nAnd the best way to describe that\nis a quote by John Wooden.\n\n00:11:37.699 --> 00:11:40.523\nI don't know how many of you\nare familiar with John Wooden.\n\n00:11:40.547 --> 00:11:42.575\nHe's very well-known in the United States\n\n00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:44.637\nand certainly among basketball fans.\n\n00:11:45.106 --> 00:11:48.960\nHe's the only person ever to make\nthe basketball Hall of Fame\n\n00:11:48.984 --> 00:11:51.120\nboth as a player and as a coach.\n\n00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:53.732\nAnd what he told his entering team --\n\n00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:59.830\nhe led UCLA to an unprecedented number\nof victories and finals in the NCAA --\n\n00:11:59.854 --> 00:12:05.287\nand what he used to tell any new team\nis he never spoke about winning.\n\n00:12:05.969 --> 00:12:10.256\nHe always said, \"When it's over\nand you look in the mirror,\n\n00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.985\ndid you do the best\nthat you were capable of?\n\n00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:16.541\nAnd if you did the best\nthat you were capable of,\n\n00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:18.063\nthe score doesn't matter.\n\n00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.359\nBut I would suspect that if you did\nthe best that you were capable of,\n\n00:12:22.383 --> 00:12:24.555\nyou will find the score to your liking.\"\n\n00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:28.913\nThat is investing in a process.\n\n00:12:29.432 --> 00:12:31.692\nWhat we do is the exact opposite.\n\n00:12:31.716 --> 00:12:33.477\nWe invest in the outcome.\n\n00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:36.249\nThis is what I want -- oh,\nI want it so desperately,\n\n00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:38.675\nbecause if I get it I will be happy.\n\n00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:42.036\nAnd you try with might and main,\nto do whatever you can,\n\n00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.076\nbut you are always focusing\non, \"This is the outcome.\"\n\n00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:48.728\nNow, focusing on the outcome is fine.\n\n00:12:48.752 --> 00:12:50.014\nIt gives you direction.\n\n00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:52.110\nInvesting in the outcome means\n\n00:12:52.134 --> 00:12:57.079\nthat you make the achievement\nof a particular outcome\n\n00:12:57.103 --> 00:12:59.873\ndependent for your well-being.\n\n00:12:59.897 --> 00:13:02.556\nAnd that is a surefire recipe for failure.\n\n00:13:03.277 --> 00:13:05.371\nWhat you can do is something else.\n\n00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:08.442\nYou can invest in the process.\n\n00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:12.632\nThat is, once you have determined,\nhere is where I am,\n\n00:13:12.656 --> 00:13:14.956\nhere is where I want to be,\nand that's fine,\n\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.964\nyou focus on the outcome only\nto the extent that it gives you direction,\n\n00:13:18.988 --> 00:13:22.304\nand then you invest yourself\ncompletely in the process.\n\n00:13:22.328 --> 00:13:24.455\nYou say, here are the steps\nyou want to take,\n\n00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:26.438\nand you put everything into it.\n\n00:13:26.934 --> 00:13:29.629\nAnd if you succeed, wonderful.\n\n00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:32.797\nAnd if you don't succeed,\n\n00:13:32.821 --> 00:13:34.765\nstill wonderful,\n\n00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:39.895\nbecause now you have a new starting point,\nand from that new starting point,\n\n00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:42.180\nyou select another outcome and keep going.\n\n00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:46.222\nAnd when you do that, you will find\nthat every day is a blast.\n\n00:13:46.775 --> 00:13:48.096\nLet me give you an example.\n\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.255\nAnd if you have children -- raise\nyour hands if you have children.\n\n00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:53.746\nHave you ever seen\na small child learn to walk?\n\n00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:57.879\nWhat happens, and this happens\ntypically between 11 and 13 months,\n\n00:13:57.903 --> 00:14:01.599\nis the child gets up\nand she sees everybody walking,\n\n00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:05.239\nshe wants to walk, she gets up,\nshe falls down, she starts crying\n\n00:14:05.263 --> 00:14:09.219\nand momma runs up and comforts her,\nkisses the place, makes it well.\n\n00:14:09.243 --> 00:14:12.182\nShe tries again, falls down,\nmommy runs up again.\n\n00:14:12.206 --> 00:14:15.893\nAfter some time, mommy feels tired\nand no longer runs up\n\n00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:17.848\nand the child stops crying,\n\n00:14:17.872 --> 00:14:19.918\nand then she gets up, takes a step\n\n00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:22.512\nand doesn't fall down,\nand then she takes another,\n\n00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:24.770\nand a beautiful smile comes on her face.\n\n00:14:24.794 --> 00:14:28.510\nAnd very soon, generally within 24 hours,\nshe's walking all over the place,\n\n00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:30.841\nupsetting your living room arrangements.\n\n00:14:30.865 --> 00:14:33.349\nAnd you know you've gone\nto a new stage of parenting.\n\n00:14:33.373 --> 00:14:34.524\nRight?\n\n00:14:34.548 --> 00:14:36.973\nNow, imagine what would happen\n\n00:14:36.997 --> 00:14:40.090\nif each time the child fell,\n\n00:14:40.114 --> 00:14:43.684\nshe would say, \"Oh my God, I failed again.\n\n00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:46.073\nI'm never going to learn to walk.\"\n\n00:14:46.097 --> 00:14:48.226\nAnd you have to get counseling for her\n\n00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.353\nto help her deal with\nfeelings of inadequacy\n\n00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:55.789\nand not being able to achieve\nand fail yet again.\n\n00:14:55.813 --> 00:14:59.552\nHow long do you think it would take her\nto learn to walk if you had to do that,\n\n00:14:59.576 --> 00:15:02.536\nif every three times she fell down,\nyou had to get a counselor\n\n00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.381\nto counsel her and so on?\n\n00:15:04.739 --> 00:15:06.143\nSounds funny, doesn't it?\n\n00:15:06.587 --> 00:15:08.691\nBut that is exactly what we're doing.\n\n00:15:08.715 --> 00:15:12.973\nWhat the child is doing\nis focusing on the process.\n\n00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:15.853\nShe's investing in the process,\n\n00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:17.667\nnot in the outcome.\n\n00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.367\nWhat we do is the exact opposite.\n\n00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:25.236\nAs we grow up, we lose the ability\nto invest in the process,\n\n00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.433\nwe start investing in the outcome.\n\n00:15:27.457 --> 00:15:31.069\nBy definition the outcome\nis outside of our control,\n\n00:15:31.093 --> 00:15:33.870\nand if that's where we spend\nall of our emotional energy,\n\n00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:36.149\nwe are going to get drained as we do.\n\n00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:38.458\nBut if, on the other hand, we said,\n\n00:15:38.482 --> 00:15:41.173\n\"Here is the outcome,\nI am going to invest in the process\n\n00:15:41.197 --> 00:15:43.530\nand give it every single bit I could,\"\n\n00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:46.635\nevery day is a blast,\n\n00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:50.872\nand you're well on your way to achieving\nthe vision that I outlined to you.\n\n00:15:51.485 --> 00:15:54.871\nThe question that I get all the time,\nis people say, \"Professor Rao,\n\n00:15:54.895 --> 00:15:57.330\nbut nothing makes me passionate.\"\n\n00:15:57.354 --> 00:15:58.930\nSo I say, \"OK, what would?\"\n\n00:15:58.954 --> 00:16:02.505\nAnd they invariably come up with,\nyou know, here is a list of things.\n\n00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:04.649\nHere's my job and here's how much it pays,\n\n00:16:04.673 --> 00:16:06.489\nthis is the kind of person my boss is,\n\n00:16:06.513 --> 00:16:08.288\nthe kind of people my colleagues are,\n\n00:16:08.312 --> 00:16:11.065\nand here's how my customers are,\nhere's how much I travel,\n\n00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:13.707\nhere's how big my office is,\nhow deep the carpeting is,\n\n00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:15.278\nhow many windows I have --\n\n00:16:15.302 --> 00:16:16.770\na bunch of parameters.\n\n00:16:17.793 --> 00:16:20.492\nAnd what I tell them is what\nI want to share with you,\n\n00:16:20.516 --> 00:16:23.778\nbecause all of that stuff --\nfirst of all, it doesn't exist.\n\n00:16:23.802 --> 00:16:26.445\nBut second, even if it did\nand you were plugged into it,\n\n00:16:26.469 --> 00:16:28.310\nit would not take more than six months\n\n00:16:28.334 --> 00:16:31.769\nfor you to be the same sorry,\nmiserable self there as you are now,\n\n00:16:32.753 --> 00:16:36.191\nbecause passion exists inside you.\n\n00:16:36.215 --> 00:16:38.745\nIt does not exist in the job.\n\n00:16:39.394 --> 00:16:42.947\nAnd if you don't find a way\nto ignite it within you\n\n00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:44.807\nright where you are,\n\n00:16:44.831 --> 00:16:47.602\nyou are not going to find it outside.\n\n00:16:48.263 --> 00:16:52.957\nBut if you do find a way\nto ignite it where you are,\n\n00:16:52.981 --> 00:16:55.578\nthen you will find that the external world\n\n00:16:55.602 --> 00:16:57.291\nrearranges itself\n\n00:16:59.699 --> 00:17:02.580\nto accommodate the new person\nthat you are becoming.\n\n00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:08.015\nAnd as you do that, you will find\nthat miracles happen on a regular basis.\n\n00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:10.261\nPersons come up\nwhom you're delighted to meet.\n\n00:17:10.285 --> 00:17:11.793\nNew people enter your life.\n\n00:17:11.817 --> 00:17:13.272\nIt's just a breeze,\n\n00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.216\nbecause all you do in your life\nis you take journeys.\n\n00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:20.618\nYou came here to this conference;\nyou went on a journey.\n\n00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:22.712\nYou hang around the water cooler,\n\n00:17:22.736 --> 00:17:25.206\ntalking about how terrible\nyour place of work is;\n\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.490\nyou went on a journey.\n\n00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:29.712\nYou watch \"Desperate Housewives,\"\nyou go on a journey.\n\n00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:31.415\nYou go on a journey\n\n00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:34.790\nwhere 40-something women are having\naffairs with 19-something gardeners\n\n00:17:34.814 --> 00:17:37.181\nwhile the husbands\nare playing around with models.\n\n00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:38.719\nAll you do is go on journeys.\n\n00:17:39.133 --> 00:17:41.732\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\nbut just ask yourself,\n\n00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:44.851\n\"Is this a journey I want to take?\n\n00:17:44.875 --> 00:17:47.914\nDoes this take me to a place\nI want to spend time?\"\n\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.688\nAnd if you start doing that,\n\n00:17:50.712 --> 00:17:52.966\nyou will find that your life changes.\n\n00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.569\nThe kind of people you meet,\nthe things you talk about,\n\n00:17:55.593 --> 00:17:57.626\nthe movies you go to,\nthe books you read --\n\n00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.105\neverything changes.\n\n00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:03.149\nAnd you begin all of that\n\n00:18:03.173 --> 00:18:05.324\nby focusing on the process.\n\n00:18:05.348 --> 00:18:08.362\nInvest in the process, not in the outcome.\n\n00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:11.070\nThank you."}, {"title": "The year open data

things, in ways that they never could have imagined.So, today I'm back just to show you a few things, to show you, in fact, there is an open data movement afoot, now, around the world. The cry of \"Raw data now!\" which I made people make in the auditorium, was heard around the world. So, let's roll the video.A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up, was when in March \u2014 on March 10th in fact, soon after TED \u2014 Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government, blogged, \"Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is, it's about bicycle accidents.\" Two days it took the Times Online to make a map, a mashable map \u2014 we call these things mash-ups \u2014 a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected.Here's more data, traffic survey data, again, put out by the U.K. government, and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards, then a user could just make a map, just by clicking.Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008. Look at Zanesville, Ohio. Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant, and which houses are there, which houses have been connected to the water. And he got, from other data sources, information to show which houses are occupied by white people. Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt, between which houses were occupied by white people and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either. The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars. That's the power of taking one piece of data, another piece of data, putting it together, and showing the result.Let's look at some data from the U.K. now. This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site, Where Does My Money Go. It allows anybody to go there and burrow down. You can burrow down by a particular type of spending, or you can go through all the different regions and compare them. So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.Yes, certainly you can do it over here. Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending in California. Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California, you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending on different things such as energy.In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets in the repositories of data.gov, and data.gov.uk. And I'm delighted to see a great competition between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.How can you use this stuff? Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places you can take, from a postcode \u2014 which is like a zip plus four \u2014 for a specific group of houses, you can make paper, print off a paper which has got very, very specific things about the bus stops, the things specifically near you.On a larger scale, this is a mash-up of the data which was released about the Afghan elections. It allows you to set your own criteria for what sort of things you want to look at. The red circles are polling stations, selected by your criteria. And then you can select also other things on the map to see what other factors, like the threat level. So, that was government data.I also talked about community-generated data \u2014 in fact I edited some. This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map. \"Terrace Theater\" I actually put on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year. I was not the only person editing the open street map. Each flash on this visualization \u2014 put together by ITO World \u2014 shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map. Let's now spin the world during the same year. Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better. You can see Europe is ablaze with updates. Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be.Here focusing in on Haiti. The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be, not as good as the map of California. Fortunately, just after the earthquake, GeoEye, a commercial company, released satellite imagery with a license, which allowed the open-source community to use it. This is January, in time lapse, of people editing ... that's the earthquake. After the earthquake, immediately, people all over the world, mappers who wanted to help, and could, looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince. The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images]. So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps \u2014 rapidly became the best map to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince. Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device being used by rescue team in Haiti.There's the map showing, on the left-hand side, that hospital \u2014 actually that's a hospital ship. This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads, damaged buildings, refugee camps \u2014 it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].So, if you've been involved in that at all, I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing, whether you've just been chanting, \"Raw data now!\" or you've been putting government or scientific data online, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much, and we have only just started!

So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking. I've had some time to think it over. And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle \u2014 it's also about the road.Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections, of which there are two types: signalized and unsignalized, which means stop signs. Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections. Roundabouts are much better. A study of 24 intersections has found crashes drop 40 percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout. Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent, fatal crashes down 90 percent. But that's just safety. What about time and gas? So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking, which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution, less time wasted, and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency than we have in the United States.So, unsignalized intersections, meaning stop signs, they save many lives, but there's an excessive proliferation of them. Small roundabouts are starting to appear. This is one in my neighborhood. And they are much better \u2014 better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs. They're expensive to install, but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.But they are not applicable in all situations. So, take, for example, the three-way intersection. So, it's logical that you'd have one there, on the minor road entering the major. But the other two are somewhat questionable. So, here's one. There's another one which I studied. Cars rarely appear on that third road.And so, the question is, what does that cost us? That intersection I looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction, and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of. That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day, that's $51,000 per year. That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution, wear on the car, and time. What's that time worth? Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars, that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S. is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year. Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction.Discount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction. Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again. And you'd still come out ahead. So, it makes one wonder, \"Why is it there?\" I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction? Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely. Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road. Can that be accomplished with existing signs? So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs. Stop signs were invented in 1915, yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.So, why not use a yield sign? Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way. That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion of alternating, or taking turns, and it's always on the minor road, allowing the major one to have primacy. So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign. You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, \"OK, remember what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different.\" That would not work.So, what the world needs now is a new type of sign. (Applause) So, you'd have a little instruction below it, you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements. And it merges the stop sign and yield signs. It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns. And uncertainty results in caution. When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with they slow down.So, now that you are all \"Road Scholars\" ... (Laughter) don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly. But you all are members of communities, and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows. And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.

And they are\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nmuch better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nThey're expensive to install,\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nbut they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nBut they are not applicable in all situations.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nSo, take, for example, the three-way intersection.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo, it's logical that you'd have one there,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\non the minor road entering the major.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nBut the other two are somewhat questionable.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nSo, here's one. There's another one which I studied.\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nCars rarely appear on that third road.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nAnd so, the question is, what does that cost us?\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nThat intersection I looked at had about 3,000\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\ncars per day in each direction,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nand so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nThat's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthat's $51,000 per year.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThat's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nwear on the car, and time.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nWhat's that time worth?\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nWell, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthat's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nis $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAdd that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\njust for that sign in each direction.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nDiscount that back to the present, at five percent:\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nover two million dollars\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nfor a stop sign, in each direction.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nNow, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nyou could actually buy the property,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\ncut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand then sell it off again.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd you'd still come out ahead.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nSo, it makes one wonder, \"Why is it there?\"\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nI mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nBecause it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nThe answer is to enable cars\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nto come in from that side road safely.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nBecause there are a lot of people who might live up there\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nand if they're waiting forever a long queue could form\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nbecause the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nCan that be accomplished with existing signs?\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nStop signs were invented in 1915,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nyield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nSo, why not use a yield sign?\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nWell the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThat means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\ntill they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nof alternating, or taking turns,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nand it's always on the minor road,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nallowing the major one to have primacy.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nYou couldn't suddenly tell everyone, \"OK, remember\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nwhat you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nThat would not work.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSo, what the world needs now\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nis a new type of sign.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nSo, you'd have a little instruction below it,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nyou know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nAnd it merges the stop sign and yield signs.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nIt's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd uncertainty results in caution.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nWhen people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthey slow down.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo, now that you are all \"Road Scholars\" ...\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\ndon't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nBut you all are members of communities,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nand you can exercise your community influence\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nto create more sensible traffic flows.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd you can have more impact on the environment\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\njust getting your neighborhood to change these things\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nthan by changing your vehicle.

I've loved only two. That first one, it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish: flavorful, textured, meaty, a bestseller on the menu. What a fish. (Laughter) Even better, it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you could feel good about selling it.I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability. \"Absolutely,\" I said. Here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs: How do we keep fish on our menus?For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love \u2014 the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish \u2014 they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So, for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it: Fish farms pollute \u2014 most of them do anyway \u2014 and they're inefficient. Take tuna, a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one. That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either.So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support them. The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.\"Don,\" I said, \"just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute.\"\"That's right,\" he said. \"We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated.\" And then he added, \"We're basically a world unto ourselves. That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one,\" he said. \"Best in the business.\"2.5 to one, great. \"2.5 what? What are you feeding?\"\"Sustainable proteins,\" he said.\"Great,\" I said. Got off the phone. And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought: What the hell is a sustainable protein? (Laughter)So the next day, just before the event, I called Don. I said, \"Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?\"He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company; no one could give me a straight answer until finally, I got on the phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too. (Laughter)\"Don,\" I said, \"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?\"Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals, and then he said chicken pellets. I said, \"Chicken pellets?\"He said, \"Yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried and processed into feed.\"I said, \"What percentage of your feed is chicken?\" Thinking, you know, two percent.\"Well, it's about 30 percent,\" he said.I said, \"Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish?\" (Laughter)There was a long pause on the line, and he said, \"There's just too much chicken in the world.\" (Laughter)I fell out of love with this fish. (Laughter) No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie. I actually am. (Laughter) No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken. (Laughter)This second fish, it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind, the kind where the more you get to know your fish, you love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. (Laughter) It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering, white color. The chef had overcooked it. Like twice over. Amazingly, it was still delicious.Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? I can't, but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel \u2014 actually his name is Miguel. (Laughter) And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist at Veta La Palma. It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well, they couldn't make it work, not economically. And ecologically, it was a disaster. It killed like 90 percent of the birds, which, for this place, is a lot of birds. And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land.What did they do? They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a 27,000-acre fish farm \u2014 bass, mullet, shrimp, eel \u2014 and in the process, Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean, you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away, and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland.I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee. (Laughter) Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands, and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees, and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite. Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.He said, \"Fish? I didn't know anything about fish. I'm an expert in relationships.\" And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know, the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing. It's great, but I was in love. And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted him. I said, \"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?\"He pointed at the algae.\"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships: It's amazing. But what are your fish eating? What's the feed conversion ratio?\"Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild. The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish. The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel, and I asked him, I said, \"For a place that seems so natural, unlike like any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success?\"At that moment, it was as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight: thousands and thousands of pink flamingos, a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.\"That's success,\" he said. \"Look at their bellies, pink. They're feasting.\" Feasting? I was totally confused.I said, \"Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?\" (Laughter)\"Yes,\" he said. (Laughter) \"We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds. Well, last year, this property had 600,000 birds on it, more than 250 different species. It's become, today, the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.\"I said, \"Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm?\" (Laughter) He shook his head, no.He said, \"We farm extensively, not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp. The shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pinker the belly, the better the system.\"Okay, so let's review: a farm that doesn't feed its animals, and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators. A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brood in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the farm. And every evening, they fly 150 miles back. (Laughter) They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92. (Laughter) No kidding.I was imagining a \"March of the Penguins\" thing, so I looked at Miguel. I said, \"Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the farm, and then do they fly 150 miles back at night? Do they do that for the children?\"He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song. (Laughter) He said, \"No; they do it because the food's better.\" (Laughter)I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish, which was delicious \u2014 and I don't like fish skin; I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy. It's that acrid, tar-like flavor. I almost never cook with it. Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin. It tasted sweet and clean, like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded. He said, \"The skin acts like a sponge. It's the last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities.\" And then he added, \"But our water has no impurities.\"OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish, a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators. And then I realized when he says, \"A farm that has no impurities,\" he made a big understatement, because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River. It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days: chemical contaminants, pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves, the water is cleaner than when it entered. The system is so healthy, it purifies the water. So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators, but a farm that's literally a water purification plant \u2014 and not just for those fish, but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic. A drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love story, however romantic, is also instructive. You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food, whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture, one in which the food actually tastes good. (Laughter) (Applause) But for a lot people, that's a bit too radical. We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers. We love farmers' markets, we love small family farms, we talk about local food, we eat organic. And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone, somewhere stands up and says, \"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to feed the world?\" How are you going to feed the world?Can I be honest? I don't love that question. No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today. One billion \u2014 that's more than ever before \u2014 because of gross inequalities in distribution, not tonnage. Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years.Feed grain to herbivores, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish, and all along agribusiness has simply asked, \"If we're feeding more people more cheaply, how terrible could that be?\" That's been the motivation, it's been the justification: it's been the business plan of American agriculture. We should call it what it is: a business in liquidation, a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible. That's not a business, and it isn't agriculture.Our breadbasket is threatened today, not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources. Not by the latest combine and tractor invention, but by fertile land; not by pumps, but by fresh water; not by chainsaws, but by forests; and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.Want to feed the world? Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves? Or better: How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself? (Applause) To do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future. It's really old, and it's tired. It's high on capital, chemistry and machines, and it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead, let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience.Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too. And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know, I'm okay with that, because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.Thank you.

Take tuna,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\na major drawback.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nIt's got a feed conversion ratio\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nof 15 to one.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThat means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nto get you one pound of farm tuna.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nNot very sustainable.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nIt doesn't taste very good either.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nSo here, finally,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nwas a company trying to do it right.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI wanted to support them.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThe day before the event,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nI called the head of P.R. for the company.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nLet's call him Don.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\n\"Don,\" I said, \"just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nfor farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute.\"\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"We're so far out,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nthe waste from our fish gets distributed,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nnot concentrated.\"\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd then he added,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\n\"We're basically a world unto ourselves.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThat feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one,\" he said.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\n\"Best in the business.\"\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\n2.5 to one, great.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\n\"2.5 what? What are you feeding?\"\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\n\"Sustainable proteins,\" he said.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\n\"Great,\" I said. Got off the phone.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nAnd that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nWhat the hell is a sustainable protein?\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nSo the next day, just before the event, I called Don.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nI said, \"Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?\"\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nHe said he didn't know. He would ask around.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWell, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nno one could give me a straight answer\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nuntil finally, I got on the phone\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nwith the head biologist.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nLet's call him Don too.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\n\"Don,\" I said,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\n\"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?\"\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nWell, he mentioned some algaes\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand some fish meals,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nand then he said chicken pellets.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nI said, \"Chicken pellets?\"\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHe said, \"Yeah, feathers, skin,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nbone meal, scraps,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\ndried and processed into feed.\"\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI said, \"What percentage\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nof your feed is chicken?\"\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThinking, you know, two percent.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n\"Well, it's about 30 percent,\" he said.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI said, \"Don, what's sustainable\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nabout feeding chicken to fish?\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nThere was a long pause on the line,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand he said, \"There's just too much chicken in the world.\"\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nI fell out of love with this fish.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nNo, not because I'm some self-righteous,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\ngoody-two shoes foodie.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nI actually am.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nNo, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nafter that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis second fish,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nit's a different kind of love story.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nIt's the romantic kind,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nthe kind where the more you get to know your fish,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nyou love the fish.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nI first ate it at a restaurant\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nin southern Spain.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nA journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nShe kind of set us up.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nIt came to the table\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\na bright, almost shimmering, white color.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThe chef had overcooked it.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nLike twice over.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAmazingly, it was still delicious.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nWho can make a fish taste good\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nafter it's been overcooked?\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nI can't,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nbut this guy can.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nLet's call him Miguel --\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nactually his name is Miguel.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nat least in the way that you and I understand it.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nHe's a biologist\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nat Veta La Palma.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nIt's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nIt's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nUntil the 1980s,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nthe farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nThey raised beef cattle\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\non what was essentially wetlands.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nThey did it by draining the land.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThey built this intricate series of canals,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand they pushed water off the land and out into the river.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWell, they couldn't make it work,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nnot economically.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd ecologically, it was a disaster.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nIt killed like 90 percent of the birds,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwhich, for this place, is a lot of birds.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd so in 1982,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\na Spanish company with an environmental conscience\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\npurchased the land.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWhat did they do?\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThey reversed the flow of water.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThey literally flipped the switch.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nInstead of pushing water out,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nthey used the channels to pull water back in.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThey flooded the canals.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nThey created a 27,000-acre fish farm --\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbass, mullet,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nshrimp, eel --\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nand in the process, Miguel and this company\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\ncompletely reversed the ecological destruction.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nThe farm's incredible.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nI mean, you've never seen anything like this.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nYou stare out at a horizon\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthat is a million miles away,\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nand all you see are flooded canals\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nand this thick, rich marshland.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nI was there not long ago with Miguel.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nHe's an amazing guy,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nlike three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nOkay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nand I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nHere, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nNow, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd here, here he sees a grouping pattern\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nIt turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nin the Mikumi National Park in Africa.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nI asked him how he became\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nsuch an expert on fish.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nHe said, \"Fish?

interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, \"Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real.\" In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a \u2014 for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect. Something fake becomes something real because of someone's perception of it.In order for us to understand each other, I want to start by showing you a rudimentary, very simple magic trick. And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s. I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s. I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it. And then I'll explain why I explained it.So, here's what happens. The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine. I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this. I'll get my sleeve back. And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here. That way you can see that at no time can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve. And the object of this is quite simple. I'm going to open my hand, and hopefully, if all is well, my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife. In fact it's held so tightly in place that I can shake it, and the knife does not come off. Nothing goes up or down my sleeve, no trickery. And you can examine everything. Ta-da! (Applause)So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic, because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very \u2014 even though it's a very simple trick methodologically. Probably many of you in the room know this trick. What happens is this. I hold the knife in my hand. I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve, that is a lie.The reason I'm holding onto my wrist is because that's actually the secret of the illusion. In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you, this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift from where it is, to a position pointing out like this. Nice one. Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there. (Laughter)So, it goes like this, from here, right. And as I move around my finger shifts. And we could talk about why this is deceptive, why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here, because the mind, and the way it processes information, it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them. But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up. Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism, but by chicanery, my index finger being there. And then when I close my finger, same thing, as I move back, this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger. I take this hand away. You give the knife out. There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.Now, (Laughter) what does that have to do with the placebo effect? I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open. I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing. It turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill, that's like aspirin shaped \u2014 it's just a round white pill \u2014 it has some certain measurable effect. But if you change the form that you give the placebo in, like you make a smaller pill, and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it, it is actually measurably more effective. Even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical \u2014 they're sugar pills. But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill. What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops. If you have capsules, they're more effective than tablets in any form. A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule. Dosage has something to do with this. One pill twice a day is not as good at three pills \u2014 I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry. But the point is ... (Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it. And the form has something to do with it. And if you want the ultimate in placebo, you've go to the needle. Right? A syringe with some inert \u2014 a couple CCs of some inert something, and you inject this into a patient ... Well this is such a powerful image in their mind, it's so much stronger than the white pill.It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you some other time when we have slides. The point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle. And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality, it's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect. I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick. And take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real. And we know from that study that when you want reality, you go to the needle.This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp, and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit. This is really my flesh. This is not Damian's special-grown flesh. That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect. I'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side.If you're queasy \u2014 (Laughs) if you faint easily \u2014 I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out. So, I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 \u2014 in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it. You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.So, here is what happens, right here, the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce. I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out? OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit, and then out the other side like this. Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in with the knife trick. (Laughter) Sort of. But you can't count my fingers right now can you? So, let me show them to you. That's one, two three, four, five. Yes, well...I know what people think when they see this. They go, \"Well, he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So, let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there? Pretty good. (Laughs) Yeah, I know. (Laughs) And the people in the back go, \"OK, I didn't really see that.\" People in the satellite room are starting to move in now. Let me give you good close look at this. That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect. That's my flesh, and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away, don't look at the thing.People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go, \"Well yeah, that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be \u2014 see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding. Well let me work up some blood for you. (Laughter) Yes, there it is. (Applause) (Laughter)Normally now, I would take the needle out. I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds. But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real, I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the stage. (Laughter) I will be seeing you several times over the next few days. I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.

Sorry.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nBut the point is ...\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\n(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd the form has something to do with it.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAnd if you want the ultimate in placebo,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nyou've go to the needle.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nRight?

Now, usually when I mention suspended animation, people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh. But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to Mars or even Pandora, as much fun as that may be. I'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma.So what do I mean when I say \"suspended animation\"? It is the process by which animals de-animate, appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed. OK, so here is the sort of big idea: If you look out at nature, you find that as you tend to see suspended animation, you tend to see immortality. And so, what I'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who's in trauma \u2014 find a way to de-animate them a bit so they're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack.An example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores. These creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet, and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation. Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive, but in suspended animation for as long as 250 million years. To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures, I want to bring it close to home. In the immortal germ line of human beings \u2014 that is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries \u2014 they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to 50 years in the life of each woman.So then there's also my favorite example of suspended animation. This is Sea-Monkeys. Those of you with children, you know about them. You go to the pet store or the toy store, and you can buy these things. You just open the bag, and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium, and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around. Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming. I was interested in what was going on in the bag, the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely. So these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird, little organisms.Occasionally, human beings are briefly de-animated, and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated that interest me the most are those having to do with the cold. Ten years ago, there was a skier in Norway that was trapped in an icy waterfall, and she was there for two hours before they extracted her. She was extremely cold, and she had no heartbeat \u2014 for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen. Seven hours later, still without a heartbeat, they brought her back to life, and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her.A couple of years later \u2014 so I get really excited about these things \u2014 about a couple of years later, there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada. Her father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift, and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper. And they found her hours later, frozen, lifeless, and they brought her back to life.There was a 65-year-old woman in Duluth, Minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter, and they brought her back to life. The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her. She got cranky and just went home. (Laughter)So, these are miracles, right? These are truly miraculous things that happen. Doctors have a saying that, in fact, \"You're not dead until you're warm and dead.\" And it's true. It's true. In the New England Journal of Medicine, there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming, people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems. That's over 50 percent. So what I was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce, maybe, what happened to the skier.Well, I have to tell you something very odd, and that is that being exposed to low oxygen does not always kill. So, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so, and if we reduce the oxygen concentration, we will all be dead. And, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab \u2014 these little garden worms, nematodes \u2014 they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen. And here's the thing that should freak you out. And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further by 100 times, to 10 parts per million, they were not dead, they were in suspended animation, and we could bring them back to life without any harm. And this precise oxygen concentration, 10 parts per million, that caused suspended animation, is conserved. We can see it in a variety of different organisms. One of the creatures we see it in is a fish. And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out of suspended animation like you would a light switch.So this was pretty shocking to me, that we could do this. And so I was wondering, when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier, that we noticed that, of course, she had no oxygen consumption, and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation. But, of course, she was also extremely cold. So we wondered what would happen if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold. And so, what we found out was that, if you take animals that are animated like you and I, and you make them cold \u2014 that is, these were the garden worms \u2014 now they're dead. But if you have them in suspended animation, and move them into the cold, they're all alive. And there's the very important thing there: If you want to survive the cold, you ought to be suspended. Right? It's a really good thing.And so, we were thinking about that, about this relationship between these things, and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier. And so we wondered: Might there be some agent that is in us, something that we make ourselves, that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away? I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things. You know?I should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest. We have, from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying breath \u2014 that's when we're newborn to when we're dead \u2014 we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what's called a standard, or basal metabolic rate. But I knew that there were examples of creatures, also mammals, that do reduce their metabolic rate such as ground squirrels and bears, they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate. So I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger that might induce such a state in us?And so, we went looking for such things. And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously. Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure. Well, we had a lot of them. We tried many different chemicals and agents, and we failed over and over again. So, one time, I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed, and I was watching a television show. It was a television show \u2014 it was a NOVA show on PBS \u2014 about caves in New Mexico. And this particular cave was Lechuguilla, and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans. The researchers had to suit up just to enter it. It's filled with this toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide. Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us. We make it ourselves. The highest concentration is in our brains. Yet, it was used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I. It's an extraordinarily toxic thing. In fact, in chemical accidents, hydrogen sulfide is known to \u2014 if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground, you appear dead, but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm, if they do that quickly.So, I thought, \"Wow, I have to get some of this.\" (Laughter) Now, it's post-9/11 America, and when you go into the research institute, and you say, \"Hi. I'd like to buy some concentrated, compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because I have these ideas, see, about wanting to suspend people. It's really going to be OK.\" So that's kind of a tough day, but I said, \"There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.\" As I said, this agent is in us, and, in fact, here's a curious thing, it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds, and where you burn it, and that you do this burning to live. And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs, might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide, and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind? And because you can't bind the oxygen, maybe you wouldn't consume it, and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen. I mean, who knows?So \u2014 (Laughter) So, there's the bit about the dopamine and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional, and you might suggest that was it. And so, we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold, and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal. Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures, and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right? We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen. So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold. It stopped moving. It appeared dead. Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold. And here's the really important point. I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us. It's rapidly metabolized, and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de-animation is simply put the thing out in room air, and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.Now, this was cosmic. Really. Because we had found a way to de-animate a mammal, and it didn't hurt it. Now, we'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine. Now, in this state of de-animation, it could not go out dancing, but it was not dead, and it was not harmed. So we started to think: Is this the agent that might have been present in the skier, and might have she had more of it than someone else, and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died, as we found out with our worm experiments?So, we wondered: Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility? And one of the things we wondered \u2014 I'm sure some of you out there are economists, and you know all about supply and demand. And when supply is equal to demand, everything's fine, but when supply falls, in this case of oxygen, and demand stays high, you're dead. So, what I just told you is we can now reduce demand. We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal. And with money we got from DARPA, we could show just that. If you give mice hydrogen sulfide, you can lower their demand for oxygen, and you can put them into oxygen concentrations that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest, and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem. Well this was really cool. We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.So these proof of concept experiments led me to say \"I should found a company, and we should take this out to a wider playing field.\" I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help. And this company, the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine, and the results are incredibly positive.In one model of heart attack, animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today. Same is true for organ failure, when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery. So, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true, so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low, incredibly low. In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit I just mentioned, which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this. You don't want to be gorking people out just to save them, it's really confusing. (Laughter)So, I want to say that we're in human trials. Now, and so \u2014 (Applause) Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over, and we're doing fine, we're now moved on. We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years. This has all moved very quickly, and the mouse experiments of hibernating mice happened in 2005; the first human studies were done in 2008, and we should know in a couple of years whether it works or not. And this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people.I want to mention that, first of all, my wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible, so thank you very much. Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington \u2014 wonderful place to work. And also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at Ikaria. One thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide, which is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly, and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide, and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly. And this gas that is delivered in over a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide, now is approved, on label, and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death. (Applause)So it's really incredible for me to be a part of this. And I want to say that I think we're on the path of understanding metabolic flexibility in a fundamental way, and that in the not too distant future, an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide, or some related compound, to a person suffering severe injuries, and that person might de-animate a bit, they might become a little more immortal. Their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time, to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then, after they get that care \u2014 like the mouse, like the skier, like the 65-year-old woman \u2014 they'll wake up. A miracle? We hope not, or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common.Thank you very much.

animation.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nNow, usually when I mention suspended animation,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.958\npeople will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nBut now, I'm not talking about gorking people out\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nto fly to Mars or even Pandora,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nas much fun as that may be.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nI'm talking about\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nthe concept of using suspended animation\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nto help people out in trauma.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nSo what do I mean\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nwhen I say \"suspended animation\"?\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nIt is the process by which\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nanimals de-animate,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nappear dead\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nand then can wake up again without being harmed.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nOK, so here is the sort of big idea:\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nIf you look out at nature,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nyou find that\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nas you tend to see suspended animation,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nyou tend to see immortality.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd so, what I'm going to tell you about\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nis a way to tell a person who's in trauma --\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nfind a way to de-animate them a bit\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nso they're a little more immortal\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nwhen they have that heart attack.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAn example of an organism or two\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthat happens to be quite immortal\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nwould be plant seeds\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nor bacterial spores.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nThese creatures are\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nsome of the most immortal life forms on our planet,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nand they tend to spend most of their time\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nin suspended animation.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nBacterial spores are thought now by scientists\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nto exist as individual cells\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nthat are alive, but in suspended animation\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nfor as long as 250 million years.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nTo suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nI want to bring it close to home.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIn the immortal germ line\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof human beings --\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries --\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthey actually sit there in a state of suspended animation\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nfor up to 50 years in the life of each woman.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nSo then there's also my favorite example\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nof suspended animation.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nThis is Sea-Monkeys.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nThose of you with children,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nyou know about them.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nYou go to the pet store or the toy store,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand you can buy these things.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nYou just open the bag, and you just dump them\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\ninto the plastic aquarium,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nand in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nWell, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nI was interested in what was going on in the bag,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthe bag on the toy store shelf\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwhere those shrimp sat\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nin suspended animation indefinitely.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nSo these ideas of suspended animation\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nare not just about cells and weird, little organisms.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nOccasionally, human beings\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nare briefly de-animated,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand the stories of people who are briefly de-animated\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nthat interest me the most\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nare those having to do with the cold.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nTen years ago, there was a skier in Norway\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthat was trapped in an icy waterfall,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand she was there for two hours before they extracted her.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nShe was extremely cold,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nand she had no heartbeat --\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nfor all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSeven hours later,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nstill without a heartbeat,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthey brought her back to life, and she went on to be\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nthe head radiologist\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nin the hospital that treated her.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nA couple of years later --\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nso I get really excited about these things --\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nabout a couple of years later,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthere was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nHer father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nand she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd they found her hours later,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nfrozen, lifeless,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand they brought her back to life.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThere was a 65-year-old woman\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nin Duluth, Minnesota last year\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthat was found frozen and without a pulse\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nin her front yard one morning in the winter,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand they brought her back to life.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nThe next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nShe got cranky and just went home.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, these are miracles, right?\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThese are truly miraculous things that happen.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nDoctors have a saying\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthat, in fact, \"You're not dead until you're warm and dead.\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd it's true. It's true.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthere was a study published that showed\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthat with appropriate rewarming,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\npeople who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ncould be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThat's over 50 percent.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nSo what I was trying to do is think of a way\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthat we could study\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nsuspended animation\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nto think about a way\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nto reproduce, maybe,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwhat happened to the skier.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nWell, I have to tell you something very odd,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nand that is that being exposed to low oxygen\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\ndoes not always kill.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nSo, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand if we reduce the oxygen concentration,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwe will all be dead.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab --\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nthese little garden worms, nematodes --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthey were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd here's the thing that should freak you out.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nby 100 times, to 10 parts per million,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nthey were not dead,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthey were in suspended animation,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nand we could bring them back to life without any harm.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd this precise oxygen concentration,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n10 parts per million,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nthat caused suspended animation,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nis conserved.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nWe can see it in a variety of different organisms.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nOne of the creatures we see it in\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nis a fish.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nof suspended animation like you would a light switch.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo this was pretty shocking to me,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthat we could do this.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAnd so I was wondering, when we were trying\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nto reproduce the work with the skier,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthat we noticed that, of course,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nshe had no oxygen consumption,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nand so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nBut, of course, she was also extremely cold.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nSo we wondered what would happen\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nif we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd so, what we found out\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwas that, if you take animals\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nthat are animated like you and I,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand you make them cold -- that is, these were the garden worms --\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nnow they're dead.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nBut if you have them in suspended animation,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand move them into the cold, they're all alive.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd there's the very important thing there:\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nIf you want to survive the cold,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nyou ought to be suspended. Right?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nIt's a really good thing.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd so, we were thinking about that,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nabout this relationship between these things,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd so we wondered: Might there be some agent\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthat is in us, something that we make ourselves,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nin such a way as to be able to survive\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwhen we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nYou know?\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nI should mention briefly here\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat physiology textbooks that you can read about\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwill tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nWe have, from the time we are slapped on the butt\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nuntil we take our last dying breath --\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat's when we're newborn to when we're dead --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nwe cannot reduce our metabolic rate\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nbelow what's called a standard,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nor basal metabolic rate.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nBut I knew that there were examples\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nof creatures, also mammals,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthat do reduce their metabolic rate\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nsuch as ground squirrels and bears,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nthey reduce their metabolic rate\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nin the wintertime when they hibernate.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nSo I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nthat might induce such a state in us?\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd so, we went looking for such things.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nKen Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWell, we had a lot of them.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nWe tried many different chemicals and agents,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nand we failed over and over again.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nSo, one time, I was at home\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwatching television on the couch\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nwhile my wife was putting our child to bed,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand I was watching a television show.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nIt was a television show --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nit was a NOVA show on PBS --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nabout caves in New Mexico.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd this particular cave was Lechuguilla,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nThe researchers had to suit up just to enter it.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nIt's filled with this toxic gas,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nhydrogen sulfide.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nNow, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nWe make it ourselves.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThe highest concentration is in our brains.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nYet, it was used\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nas a chemical warfare agent in World War I.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nIt's an extraordinarily toxic thing.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nIn fact, in chemical accidents,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nhydrogen sulfide is known to --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nif you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nyou appear dead,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nbut if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nif they do that quickly.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nSo, I thought, \"Wow, I have to get some of this.\"\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nNow, it's post-9/11 America,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand when you go into the research institute,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand you say, \"Hi.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nI'd like to buy some concentrated,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\ncompressed gas cylinders\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nof a lethal gas\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nbecause I have these ideas, see,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nabout wanting to suspend people.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIt's really going to be OK.\"\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nSo that's kind of a tough day,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nbut I said, \"There really is\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nsome basis for thinking why you might want to do this.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAs I said, this agent is in us,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand, in fact, here's a curious thing,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nit binds to the very place inside of your cells\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nwhere oxygen binds, and where you burn it,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nand that you do this burning to live.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nAnd so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nmight we be able to give a person\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nsome hydrogen sulfide,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand might it be able to occupy that place\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nlike in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd because you can't bind the oxygen,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nmaybe you wouldn't consume it,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nI mean, who knows?\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nSo -- (Laughter)\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSo, there's the bit about the dopamine\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand you might suggest that was it.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd so, we wanted to find out\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nmight we be able to use\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nhydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand we wanted to see whether we could\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nreproduce this skier in a mammal.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nNow, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nand when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nby actually burning more oxygen.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo, it was interesting for us\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nwhen we applied hydrogen sulfide\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nto a mouse when it was also cold\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nbecause what happened is the core temperature\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nof the mouse got cold.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nIt stopped moving.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nIt appeared dead.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nIts oxygen consumption rate\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nfell by tenfold.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nAnd here's the really important point.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nI told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's rapidly metabolized,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand all you have to do after six hours of being\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nin this state of de-animation\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nis simply put the thing out in room air,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nNow, this was cosmic.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nReally. Because we had found a way\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nto de-animate a mammal,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand it didn't hurt it.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow, we'd found a way to reduce\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nits oxygen consumption\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nto rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nNow, in this state of de-animation,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nit could not go out dancing,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nbut it was not dead,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nand it was not harmed.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo we started to think: Is this the agent\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nthat might have been present in the skier,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nand might have she had more of it than someone else,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand might that have been able to reduce\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nher demand for oxygen\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nbefore she got so cold that\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nshe otherwise would have died,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nas we found out with our worm experiments?\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nSo, we wondered:\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nCan we do anything useful\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nwith this capacity to\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\ncontrol metabolic flexibility?\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAnd one of the things we wondered --\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI'm sure some of you out there are economists,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nand you know all about supply and demand.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nAnd when supply is equal to demand,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\neverything's fine,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbut when supply falls,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nin this case of oxygen,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand demand stays high, you're dead.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nSo, what I just told you\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nis we can now reduce demand.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWe ought to be able to lower supply\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nto unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nAnd with money we got from DARPA,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nwe could show just that.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIf you give mice hydrogen sulfide,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nyou can lower their demand for oxygen,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nand you can put them into oxygen concentrations\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nthat are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nand they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nWell this was really cool.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nWe also found out that we could subject animals\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nto otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nif we gave them hydrogen sulfide.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nSo these proof of concept experiments\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nled me to say \"I should found a company,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nand we should take this out to a wider playing field.\"\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nI founded a company called Ikaria\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nwith others' help.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nAnd this company, the first thing it did\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nwas make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nan injectable form that we could put in\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand send it out to physician scientists all over the world\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nwho work on models of critical care medicine,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nand the results are incredibly positive.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIn one model of heart attack,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nanimals given hydrogen sulfide\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nshowed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\ncompared to those who got the standard of care that\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nyou and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSame is true for organ failure,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nwhen you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nand damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nSo, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nall over the world saying this is true,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nso it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\ndecreases damage that you receive\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nfrom being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nrequired to get this benefit\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nare low, incredibly low.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nIn fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthe metabolism of people much at all\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nto see the benefit I just mentioned,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nwhich is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nYou don't want to be gorking people out\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\njust to save them, it's really confusing.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nSo, I want to say that we're in human trials.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nNow, and so --\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nThank you.

We're testing these kinds of simple sensor-network technologies in the home so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with can help them deal with their medications. And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone, and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take, and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend. And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly, that sits on their kitchen table and says, \"I'm old. I'm frail.\" It's surreptitious technology that's helping them do a simple task of taking the right pill at the right time.Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones. Because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it. Think about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times. \"Hello? Hey.\" All right? That's the first time. \"Hello? Uh, hey.\" \"Hello? Uh, who? Oh, hey.\" All right? Very big differences between the way I answered the phone the three times. And as we monitor phone usage by seniors over a long period of time, down to the tenths of a microsecond, that recognition moment of whether they can figure out that person on the other end is a friend and we start talking to them immediately, or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk, where they're like, \"Wait, who is this? Oh.\" Right? Waiting for that recognition moment may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia than anything that shows up clinically today.We call these behavioral markers. There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone as quickly, when it rings, as they used to? Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem? Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's, where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients may be the best early indicator of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically. But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme and your voice has become so quiet.So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice. When you pick up the phone, how much tremor are you having, and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time? Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to? Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis? Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to? And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health mean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future? And then wow, what a radical idea, we \u2014 except in the United States \u2014 might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line. Wow, what a great day that will be once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.So, these are what I would call behavioral markers. And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on for the last 10 years at Intel. How do you put simple disruptive technologies, and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk? Behavioral markers matter. How do we change behavior? How do we measure changes in behavior in a meaningful way that's going to help us with prevention of disease, early onset of disease, and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?Now, why would Intel let me spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years, trying to understand the needs of seniors and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers? This is some of the field work that we've done. We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households in 20 countries over the last 10 years. We study people in Rochester, New York. We go live with them in the winter because what they do in the winter, and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize, is very different than in the summer. If they have a hip fracture we go with them and we study their entire discharge experience. If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network, we fly and study them as well.So, we study the holistic health experience of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years in 20 different countries. Why is Intel willing to fund that? It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about. Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies that could help with independent living, this is what I called it: \"Y2K + 10.\"You know, back in 2000, we were all so obsessed with paying attention to the aging of our computers, and whether or not they were going to survive the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000, that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to. It was right around New Years. And that switchover, when we had the larger number of older people on the planet, for the first time than younger people. For the first time in human history \u2014 and barring aliens landing or some major other pandemic, that's the expectation from demographers, going forward.And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time to convince Intel to work on this. Right? Y2K + 10 was coming, the baby boomers starting to retire. Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here. This is a map of the entire world. It's like the lights are on, but nobody's home on this demographic Y2K + 10 problem. Right? I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here, and we're not doing anything about it.The health reform bill is largely ignoring the realities of the age wave that's coming, and the implications for what we need to do to change not only how we pay for care, but deliver care in some radically different ways. And in fact, it's upon us. I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security. That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement. She was born one second after midnight in 1946. A retired school teacher, there she is with a Social Security administrator. The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year. We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.All right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door. This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar, but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it. We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe, and react, as opposed to prepare for it. So, one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem is, I want to argue, we have what I would call mainframe poisoning.Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago, he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase \"mainframe healthcare,\" and I've been extending and expanding this. He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, \"Eric that's a really cool concept.\" I was like, \"Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article. I just extended it.\" You know, this is the mainframe.This mentality of traveling to and timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems actually began in 1787. This is the first general hospital in Vienna. And actually the second general hospital in Vienna, in about 1850, was where we started to build out an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties. And it's a place in which we started developing architecture that literally divided the body, and divided care into departments and compartments. And it was reflected in our architecture, it was reflected in the way that we taught students, and this mainframe mentality persists today.Now, I'm not anti-hospital. With my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies, I've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times. But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right? And this is mainframe healthcare. And just as 30 years ago we couldn't conceive that we would have the power of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size in our purses and on our belts, that we're carrying around in our cell phone today, and suddenly, computing, that used to be an expert driven system, it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives \u2014 that shift from mainframe to personal computing is what we have to do for healthcare. We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare.We are obsessed with this way of thinking. When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say, \"Quick response: healthcare.\" The first word that comes up is \"doctor.\" The second that comes up is \"hospital.\" And the third is \"illness\" or \"sickness.\" Right? We are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare and healthcare innovation as something that goes into that place. Our entire health reform discussion right now, health I.T., when we talk with policy makers, equals \"How are we going to get doctors using electronic medical records in the mainframe?\" We're not thinking about how do we shift from the mainframe to the home. And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right?This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system. We're doing 15-minute exams with patients. It's population-based. We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting, and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again, and send them home, and hope \u2014 we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website \u2014 that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.And the problem is we can't afford it today, folks. We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured. And now we want to do a double-double of the age wave coming through? Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different. We've got to focus on the home.We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive, prevention-driven? How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7? How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you? How do we collect not just biological data but behavioral data, psychological data, relational data, in and on and around the home? And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan that uses all this great technology that's around us to change our behavior? That's what we need to do for our personal health model.I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi from one of our studies \u2014 in her 90s, had to move out of her home because her family was worried about falls. Raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your household, or any of your loved ones, your parents or so forth. Right? Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior. This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it, moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility. She tripped over her oxygen tank.Many people in this generation won't press the button, even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody, even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month. Boomers will press the button. Trust me. They're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?Mimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning, finally somebody came in and found her, sent her to the hospital. They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit. First night in the nursing home unit where she had been in the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another, kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis, sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from, no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol, which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores, basically, had heart problems, and died from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.Now, the most frightening thing about this is this is my wife's grandmother. Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English, I work for Intel, I make a good salary, I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries \u2014 it's an area of research that I work on. I have access to senators and CEOs. I can't stop this from happening. What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English or don't have the kind of access to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur? How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls from ever occurring in the first place?Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing to try to do exactly that. I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer. It's a research platform. It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG. There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play kind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild, in the real world, things like tremor, gait, stride length and those kinds of things.The problem is, our understanding of falls today, like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell, from the State, saying, \"What were you doing when you fell?\" That's sort of the state of the art. But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet, embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems that we borrowed from sports medicine, we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households to collect actual kinematic motion data to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring that can show us that mom has become risk at falls?And most often we can do two interventions, fix the meds mix. I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in from these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else knew that they were on, because we see the changes in their patterns in the household. Right? These discoveries of behavioral markers, and behavioral changes are game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland of \u2014 actually what you're seeing is she's looking at data, in this picture, from the Magic Carpet. So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway, and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months. Here's what some of this data might look like. This is actually sensor firings.These are two different subjects in our study. It's about a year's worth of data. The color represents different rooms they are in the house. This person on the left is living in their own home. This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility. I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right? Now, this doesn't mean that much to you. But when we look at these cycles of data over a longer period of time \u2014 and we're looking at everything from motion around different rooms in the house, to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up, about gait and stride length \u2014 these streams of data are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns that we've never understood before.You can go to ORCATech.org \u2014 it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology \u2014 to see more about that. The problem is, Intel is still one of the largest funders in the world of independent living technology research. I'm not bragging about how much we fund; it's how little anyone else actually pays attention to aging and funds innovation on aging, chronic disease management and independent living in the home.So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is: 10,000 households or bust. We need to drive a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study of independent living technologies, where we have 10,000 elderly connected households with broadband, full medical characterization, and a platform by which we can start to experiment and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies that the universities fund, to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies. So, 10,000 households or bust. These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.My fifth and final phrase: I have tried for two years, and there were moments when we were quite close, to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform from something and to something, from a mainframe model to a personal health model, or to mean something more than just a debate about the public option and how we're going to finance. It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare. We're going to figure something out for the next 10 years, and try it. No matter who pays for it, we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way and treating the home and the patient and the family member and the caregivers as part of these coordinated care teams and using disruptive technologies that are already here to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.The president needs to stand up and say, at the end of a healthcare reform debate, \"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes, to the home, in 10 years.\" It's achievable. We should do it economically, we should do it morally, and we should do it for quality of life. But there is no goal within this health reform. It's just a mess today.So, you know, that's my last message to you. How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming? It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution. And if we don't create a personal health movement, something that we're all aiming towards in reform, then we're going to move nowhere. So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward. Thanks very much.

I'm a game designer. I've been making games online now for 10 years, and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games. Now, I have a plan for this, and it entails convincing more people, including all of you, to spend more time playing bigger and better games.Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games. Some of you might be thinking, \"That's a lot of time to spend playing games. Maybe too much time, considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world.\" But actually, according to my research at the Institute for the Future, actually the opposite is true. Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world's most urgent problems.In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week. So, that's probably a bit of a counter-intuitive idea, so I'll say it again, let it sink in: If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity, I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week, by the end of the next decade.(Laughter)No. I'm serious. I am.Here's why. This picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species.(Laughter)Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano. He wanted to capture the emotion of gaming, so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing. And this is a classic gaming emotion. Now, if you're not a gamer, you might miss some of the nuance in this photo. You probably see the sense of urgency, a little bit of fear, but intense concentration, deep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.If you are a gamer, you will notice a few nuances here: the crinkle of the eyes up, and around the mouth is a sign of optimism, and the eyebrows up is surprise. This is a gamer who's on the verge of something called an \"epic win.\"(Laughter)Oh, you've heard of that. OK, good, so we have some gamers among us. An epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive, you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it. It was almost beyond the threshold of imagination, and when you get there, you're shocked to discover what you're truly capable of. That's an epic win. This is a gamer on the verge of an epic win. And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century \u2014 the face of someone who, against all odds, is on the verge of an epic win.Now, unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems. This is what I call the \"I'm Not Good At Life\" face. This is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good. This is me making the \"I'm Not Good At Life\" face. This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where I did my PhD on why we're better in games than we are in real life. And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have. We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games.I don't mean just good as in successful, although that's part of it. We do achieve more in game worlds. But I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters \u2014 inspired to collaborate and to cooperate. And when we're in game worlds, I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves \u2014 the most likely to help at a moment's notice, the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes, to get up after failure and try again. And in real life, when we face failure, when we confront obstacles, we often don't feel that way. We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed, we feel anxious, maybe depressed, frustrated or cynical. We never have those feelings when we're playing games, they just don't exist in games. So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can't achieve everything? How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work? So I looked at games like World of Warcraft, which is really the ideal collaborative problem-solving environment. And I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds.The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games, especially in World of Warcraft, there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away. But not just any mission, it's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game. Right? So you can do it. They never give you a challenge you can't achieve. But it is on the verge of what you're capable of, so you have to try hard. But there's no unemployment in World of Warcraft; no sitting around, wringing your hands \u2014 there's always something specific and important to be done. There are also tons of collaborators. Everywhere you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission.That's not something we have in real life that easily, this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators. And there's this epic story, this inspiring story of why we're there, and what we're doing, and we get all this positive feedback. You guys have heard of leveling up, +1 strength, +1 intelligence. We don't get that kind of constant feedback in real life. When I get off this stage, I'm not going to have +1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea, +20 crazy idea. I don't get that feedback in real life.Now, the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time, we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds. It's just better than reality. So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in context: 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up. That was the first upright primate.So when we talk about how much time we're currently investing in playing games, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution, which is an extraordinary thing. But it's also apt, because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games, we're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings. We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species. This is true. I believe this.So, consider this really interesting statistic; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University: The average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21. Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons. First of all, for children in the United States, 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school, from fifth grade to high school graduation, if you have perfect attendance.(Laughter)So, we have an entire parallel track of education going on, where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they're learning about everything else in school. Some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell's new book \"Outliers,\" so you would have heard of his theory of success, the \"10,000 hours\" theory of success. It's based on this great cognitive-science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21, we will be virtuosos at it. We will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world. And so, now what we're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers.So, the big question is, \"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?\" Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands. This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games. These are our virtuoso gamers, 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something. And in the next decade, we're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is. If you don't know it already, this is coming. The game industry is developing consoles that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet, so that gamers all over the world, particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online. They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade. It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.So I've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at. Here are the four things I came up with. The first is urgent optimism. OK, think of this as extreme self-motivation. Urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle, combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible, and that it's always worth trying, and trying now. Gamers don't sit around. Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric. There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've beaten us badly. And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone. We trust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rules, value the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.And so, playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation. And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result. Blissful productivity. I love it. You know, there's a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week \u2014 kind of a half-time job. It's because we know, when we're playing a game, that we're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing, or hanging out. We know that we are optimized as human beings, to do hard and meaningful work. And gamers are willing to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work.Finally: epic meaning. Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories. So, just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective: So, you all know Wikipedia, biggest wiki in the world. Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles, is the World of Warcraft wiki. Five million people use it every month. They have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world. They are building an epic story. They are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft.Okay, so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing: Gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals. These are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world. And the only problem is, they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world. That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.There's an economist named Edward Castronova. His work is brilliant. He looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds. And he says, \"We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments.\" And he's an economist, so he's rational. And he says \u2014(Laughter)Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant. But he says that this makes perfect sense, because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life. They can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life. So he says, for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world. Now, I also agree that that is rational, for now. But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation. We have to start making the real world work more like a game.I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago. These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles. Before we had awesome game controllers, we had sheep's knuckles. And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings, and if you're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, you might know this history, which is the history of who invented games and why. Herodotus says that games, particularly dice games, were invented in the kingdom of Lydia, during a time of famine.Apparently, there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy. People were suffering. People were fighting. It was an extreme situation, they needed an extreme solution. So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games, and they set up a kingdom-wide policy: On one day, everybody would eat, and on the next day, everybody would play games. And they would be so immersed in playing the dice games, because games are so engaging, and immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity, they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat. And then on the next day, they would play games; and on the next day, they would eat.And according to Herodotus, they passed 18 years this way, surviving through a famine, by eating on one day, and playing games on the next. Now, this is exactly, I think, how we're using games today. We're using games to escape real-world suffering \u2014 we're using games to get away from everything that's broken in the real environment, everything that's not satisfying about real life, and we're getting what we need from games.But it doesn't have to end there. This is really exciting. According to Herodotus, after 18 years the famine wasn't getting better, so the king decided they would play one final dice game. They divided the entire kingdom in half. They played one dice game, and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure. They would leave Lydia, and they would go out in search of a new place to live, leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available, and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive.Now, this sounds crazy, right? But recently, DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans, who then led to the Roman Empire, actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians. And so, recently, scientists have suggested that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true. And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years, that could have explained the famine. So this crazy story might be true. They might have actually saved their culture by playing games, escaping to games for 18 years, and then been so inspired, and knew so much about how to come together with games, that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.Okay, we can do that.(Laughter)We've been playing Warcraft since 1994. That was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series. That was 16 years ago. They played dice games for 18 years, we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years. I say we are ready for our own epic game. Now, they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world, so that's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from. Let's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games, until we solve real-world problems.Now, I know you're asking, \"How are we going to solve real-world problems in games?\" Well, that's what I've devoted my work to over the past few years, at the Institute for the Future. We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto, and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future. We do not want to try to predict the future. What we want to do is make the future. We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome, and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality. We want to imagine epic wins, and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.I'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures. This is World Without Oil. We made this game in 2007. This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional, but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real, and to live your real life as if we've run out of oil. So when you come to the game, you sign up, tell us where you live, and then we give you real-time news videos, data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs, what's not available, how food supply is being affected, how transportation is being affected, if schools are closed, if there's rioting, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true. And then we ask you to blog about it, to post videos, to post photos.We piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we've tracked them for the three years since. And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience. Nobody wants to change how they live, just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to. But if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them, \"We've run out of oil. This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on. Challenge yourself to see how you would survive,\" most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game.So for the next world-saving game, we decided to aim higher \u2014 bigger problem than just peak oil. We did a game called Superstruct at the Institute for the Future. And the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet. This supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System, of course. We asked people to come online \u2014 almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team \u2014 you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict, and they all have something to do to save the world.(Laughter)But in our game, instead of just having five people on the dream team, we said, \"Everybody's on the dream team, and it's your job to invent the future of energy, the future of food, the future of health, the future of security and the future of the social safety net.\" We had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks. They came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online, Google \"Superstruct,\" and see.So, finally, the last game, we're launching it March 3rd. This is a game done with the World Bank Institute. If you complete the game, you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Innovator, class of 2010. Working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa, and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills. We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up in skills like local insight, knowledge networking, sustainability, vision and resourcefulness. I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people, anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas, who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world.So, I'm going to wrap up now. I want to ask a question. What do you think happens next? We've got all these amazing gamers, we've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do, but none of them have saved the real world yet. Well I hope you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work, that games are a powerful platform for change. We have all these amazing superpowers: blissful productivity, the ability to weave a tight social fabric, this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning.I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter, to survive on this planet for another century. That's my hope, that you will join me in making and playing games like this. When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want, so I say: Let the world-changing games begin.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 799, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.180\nI'm Jane McGonigal.

So you can do it.\n\n00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:57.622\nThey never give you a challenge\nyou can't achieve.\n\n00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:00.021\nBut it is on the verge\nof what you're capable of,\n\n00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:01.289\nso you have to try hard.\n\n00:05:01.313 --> 00:05:04.634\nBut there's no unemployment\nin World of Warcraft; no sitting around,\n\n00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:05.809\nwringing your hands --\n\n00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.652\nthere's always something\nspecific and important to be done.\n\n00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:10.509\nThere are also tons of collaborators.\n\n00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.921\nEverywhere you go,\nhundreds of thousands of people\n\n00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.887\nready to work with you\nto achieve your epic mission.\n\n00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:18.537\nThat's not something we have\nin real life that easily,\n\n00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:21.550\nthis sense that at our fingertips\nare tons of collaborators.\n\n00:05:21.574 --> 00:05:25.065\nAnd there's this epic story,\nthis inspiring story of why we're there,\n\n00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:26.250\nand what we're doing,\n\n00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:28.152\nand we get all this positive feedback.\n\n00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:32.169\nYou guys have heard of leveling up,\n+1 strength, +1 intelligence.\n\n00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:34.875\nWe don't get that kind\nof constant feedback in real life.\n\n00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.140\nWhen I get off this stage,\n\n00:05:36.164 --> 00:05:41.046\nI'm not going to have\n+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,\n\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.734\n+20 crazy idea.\n\n00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:44.776\nI don't get that feedback in real life.\n\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.648\nNow, the problem with collaborative\nonline environments like World of Warcraft\n\n00:05:49.672 --> 00:05:53.827\nis that it's so satisfying to be\non the verge of an epic win all the time,\n\n00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:56.426\nwe decide to spend all our time\nin these game worlds.\n\n00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.934\nIt's just better than reality.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.934\nSo, so far, collectively\nall the World of Warcraft gamers\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.934\nhave spent 5.93 million years\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.934\nsolving the virtual problems of Azeroth.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.118\nNow, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.334\nIt might sound like it's a bad thing.\n\n00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:13.682\nBut to put that in context:\n\n00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.789\n5.93 million years ago\n\n00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:20.438\nwas when our earliest primate\nhuman ancestors stood up.\n\n00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:23.192\nThat was the first upright primate.\n\n00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:26.320\nSo when we talk about how much time\n\n00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.356\nwe're currently investing\nin playing games,\n\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.158\nthe only way it makes sense\nto even think about it\n\n00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:34.934\nis to talk about time\nat the magnitude of human evolution,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.934\nwhich is an extraordinary thing.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.466\nBut it's also apt,\n\n00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.648\nbecause it turns out that by spending\nall this time playing games,\n\n00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:44.934\nwe're actually changing\nwhat we are capable of as human beings.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.272\nWe're evolving to be a more\ncollaborative and hearty species.\n\n00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.066\nThis is true. I believe this.\n\n00:06:50.407 --> 00:06:53.248\nSo, consider this really\ninteresting statistic;\n\n00:06:53.272 --> 00:06:56.756\nit was recently published by a researcher\nat Carnegie Mellon University:\n\n00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.934\nThe average young person today\nin a country with a strong gamer culture\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.612\nwill have spent 10,000 hours\nplaying online games\n\n00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:05.882\nby the age of 21.\n\n00:07:06.397 --> 00:07:09.703\nNow 10,000 hours is a really\ninteresting number for two reasons.\n\n00:07:10.378 --> 00:07:13.824\nFirst of all, for children\nin the United States,\n\n00:07:13.848 --> 00:07:18.832\n10,080 hours is the exact amount\nof time you will spend in school,\n\n00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:20.958\nfrom fifth grade\nto high school graduation,\n\n00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.505\nif you have perfect attendance.\n\n00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:23.530\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:27.139\nSo, we have an entire\nparallel track of education going on,\n\n00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:30.871\nwhere young people are learning as much\nabout what it takes to be a good gamer\n\n00:07:30.895 --> 00:07:33.375\nas they're learning\nabout everything else in school.\n\n00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.986\nSome of you have probably read\nMalcolm Gladwell's new book \"Outliers,\"\n\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.352\nso you would have heard\nof his theory of success,\n\n00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.475\nthe \"10,000 hours\" theory of success.\n\n00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:43.934\nIt's based on this great\ncognitive-science research\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.275\nthat says if we can master 10,000 hours\n\n00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:50.672\nof effortful study at anything\nby the age of 21,\n\n00:07:50.696 --> 00:07:52.195\nwe will be virtuosos at it.\n\n00:07:52.219 --> 00:07:53.934\nWe will be as good at whatever we do\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.799\nas the greatest people in the world.\n\n00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:58.581\nAnd so, now what we're looking at\n\n00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:02.486\nis an entire generation of young people\nwho are virtuoso gamers.\n\n00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.934\nSo, the big question is,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.275\n\"What exactly are gamers\ngetting so good at?\"\n\n00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:11.084\nBecause if we could figure that out,\n\n00:08:11.108 --> 00:08:15.513\nwe would have a virtually unprecedented\nhuman resource on our hands.\n\n00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.800\nThis is how many people\nwe now have in the world\n\n00:08:17.824 --> 00:08:20.711\nwho spend at least an hour\na day playing online games.\n\n00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:22.831\nThese are our virtuoso gamers,\n\n00:08:22.855 --> 00:08:26.687\n500 million people who are\nextraordinarily good at something.\n\n00:08:27.616 --> 00:08:28.934\nAnd in the next decade,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwe're going to have another billion gamers\n\n00:08:30.982 --> 00:08:33.759\nwho are extraordinarily\ngood at whatever that is.\n\n00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:35.934\nIf you don't know it already,\nthis is coming.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.934\nThe game industry is developing consoles\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.312\nthat are low-energy and that work\nwith the wireless phone networks\n\n00:08:41.336 --> 00:08:43.162\ninstead of broadband Internet,\n\n00:08:43.186 --> 00:08:44.934\nso that gamers all over the world,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.782\nparticularly in India, China,\nBrazil, can get online.\n\n00:08:48.806 --> 00:08:51.432\nThey expect one billion more\ngamers in the next decade.\n\n00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.480\nIt will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.\n\n00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:55.383\nSo I've started to think about\n\n00:08:55.407 --> 00:08:57.623\nwhat these games\nare making us virtuosos at.\n\n00:08:57.647 --> 00:08:59.598\nHere are the four things I came up with.\n\n00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.582\nThe first is urgent optimism.\n\n00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:04.288\nOK, think of this\nas extreme self-motivation.\n\n00:09:04.701 --> 00:09:07.749\nUrgent optimism is the desire\nto act immediately\n\n00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:09.430\nto tackle an obstacle,\n\n00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:13.034\ncombined with the belief that we have\na reasonable hope of success.\n\n00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:16.387\nGamers always believe\nthat an epic win is possible,\n\n00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:19.116\nand that it's always worth\ntrying, and trying now.\n\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.390\nGamers don't sit around.\n\n00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:24.787\nGamers are virtuosos\nat weaving a tight social fabric.\n\n00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.068\nThere's a lot of interesting\nresearch that shows\n\n00:09:27.092 --> 00:09:29.648\nwe like people better\nafter we play a game with them,\n\n00:09:29.672 --> 00:09:31.481\neven if they've beaten us badly.\n\n00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:34.847\nAnd the reason is, it takes a lot of trust\nto play a game with someone.\n\n00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:37.163\nWe trust that they will spend\ntheir time with us,\n\n00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:39.029\nthat they will play by the same rules,\n\n00:09:39.053 --> 00:09:42.385\nvalue the same goal,\nstay with the game until it's over.\n\n00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:43.977\nAnd so, playing a game together\n\n00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:46.934\nactually builds up bonds\nand trust and cooperation.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.783\nAnd we actually build stronger\nsocial relationships as a result.\n\n00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:52.934\nBlissful productivity. I love it.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.252\nYou know, there's a reason why\nthe average World of Warcraft gamer\n\n00:09:56.276 --> 00:09:58.934\nplays for 22 hours a week --\nkind of a half-time job.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.560\nIt's because we know,\nwhen we're playing a game,\n\n00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:03.933\nthat we're actually happier working hard\n\n00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:06.208\nthan we are relaxing, or hanging out.\n\n00:10:06.232 --> 00:10:08.510\nWe know that we are\noptimized as human beings,\n\n00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:10.152\nto do hard and meaningful work.\n\n00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:13.383\nAnd gamers are willing\nto work hard all the time,\n\n00:10:13.407 --> 00:10:15.008\nif they're given the right work.\n\n00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:17.224\nFinally: epic meaning.\n\n00:10:17.732 --> 00:10:21.469\nGamers love to be attached\nto awe-inspiring missions\n\n00:10:21.493 --> 00:10:25.505\nto human planetary-scale stories.\n\n00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:29.269\nSo, just one bit of trivia\nthat helps put that into perspective:\n\n00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:32.934\nSo, you all know Wikipedia,\nbiggest wiki in the world.\n\n00:10:33.315 --> 00:10:36.934\nSecond biggest wiki in the world,\nwith nearly 80,000 articles,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.934\nis the World of Warcraft wiki.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.934\nFive million people use it every month.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.617\nThey have compiled more information\nabout World of Warcraft on the Internet\n\n00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:47.748\nthan any other topic covered\non any other wiki in the world.\n\n00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.808\nThey are building an epic story.\n\n00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:52.054\nThey are building an epic\nknowledge resource\n\n00:10:52.078 --> 00:10:53.610\nabout the World of Warcraft.\n\n00:10:53.634 --> 00:10:57.934\nOkay, so these are four superpowers\nthat add up to one thing:\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.444\nGamers are super-empowered\nhopeful individuals.\n\n00:11:02.753 --> 00:11:05.958\nThese are people who believe\nthat they are individually capable\n\n00:11:05.982 --> 00:11:07.532\nof changing the world.\n\n00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:09.191\nAnd the only problem is,\n\n00:11:09.215 --> 00:11:12.244\nthey believe that they are capable\nof changing virtual worlds\n\n00:11:12.268 --> 00:11:13.934\nand not the real world.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.071\nThat's the problem\nthat I'm trying to solve.\n\n00:11:16.571 --> 00:11:18.934\nThere's an economist\nnamed Edward Castronova.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.128\nHis work is brilliant.\n\n00:11:20.152 --> 00:11:23.054\nHe looks at why people are investing\nso much time and energy\n\n00:11:23.078 --> 00:11:24.934\nand money in online worlds.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.141\nAnd he says,\n\n00:11:26.165 --> 00:11:29.473\n\"We're witnessing what amounts to\nno less than a mass exodus\n\n00:11:29.497 --> 00:11:31.934\nto virtual worlds and online\ngame environments.\"\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.147\nAnd he's an economist, so he's rational.\n\n00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.608\nAnd he says --\n\n00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:37.275\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:39.584\nNot like me, I'm a game\ndesigner; I'm exuberant.\n\n00:11:39.608 --> 00:11:43.807\nBut he says that this makes perfect sense,\n\n00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:46.255\nbecause gamers can achieve\nmore in online worlds\n\n00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:47.605\nthan they can in real life.\n\n00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:50.090\nThey can have stronger\nsocial relationships in games\n\n00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:51.669\nthan they can have in real life;\n\n00:11:51.693 --> 00:11:54.660\nthey get better feedback\nand feel more rewarded in games\n\n00:11:54.684 --> 00:11:55.934\nthan they do in real life.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo he says, for now it makes perfect sense\n\n00:11:57.982 --> 00:12:01.557\nfor gamers to spend more time\nin virtual worlds than the real world.\n\n00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:04.934\nNow, I also agree\nthat that is rational, for now.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.934\nBut it is not, by any means,\nan optimal situation.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.934\nWe have to start making\nthe real world work more like a game.\n\n00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:14.317\nI take my inspiration\nfrom something that happened\n\n00:12:14.341 --> 00:12:15.770\n2,500 years ago.\n\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.934\nThese are ancient dice,\nmade out of sheep's knuckles.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.934\nBefore we had awesome game controllers,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.771\nwe had sheep's knuckles.\n\n00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:26.863\nAnd these represent\nthe first game equipment\n\n00:12:26.887 --> 00:12:28.753\ndesigned by human beings,\n\n00:12:28.777 --> 00:12:32.521\nand if you're familiar with the work\nof the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,\n\n00:12:32.545 --> 00:12:34.054\nyou might know this history,\n\n00:12:34.078 --> 00:12:36.998\nwhich is the history\nof who invented games and why.\n\n00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.518\nHerodotus says that games,\nparticularly dice games,\n\n00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:42.934\nwere invented in the kingdom of Lydia,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.767\nduring a time of famine.\n\n00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:47.130\nApparently, there was such a severe famine\n\n00:12:47.154 --> 00:12:50.934\nthat the king of Lydia decided\nthey had to do something crazy.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.054\nPeople were suffering.\nPeople were fighting.\n\n00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:56.934\nIt was an extreme situation,\nthey needed an extreme solution.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.934\nSo, according to Herodotus,\nthey invented dice games,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.934\nand they set up a kingdom-wide policy:\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.540\nOn one day, everybody would eat,\n\n00:13:05.564 --> 00:13:07.934\nand on the next day,\neverybody would play games.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.592\nAnd they would be so immersed\nin playing the dice games,\n\n00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:12.060\nbecause games are so engaging,\n\n00:13:12.084 --> 00:13:15.296\nand immerse us in such satisfying,\nblissful productivity,\n\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.034\nthey would ignore the fact\nthat they had no food to eat.\n\n00:13:18.058 --> 00:13:20.344\nAnd then on the next day,\nthey would play games;\n\n00:13:20.368 --> 00:13:22.244\nand on the next day, they would eat.\n\n00:13:22.268 --> 00:13:23.934\nAnd according to Herodotus,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.934\nthey passed 18 years this way,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.697\nsurviving through a famine,\n\n00:13:27.721 --> 00:13:30.387\nby eating on one day,\nand playing games on the next.\n\n00:13:30.411 --> 00:13:34.115\nNow, this is exactly, I think,\nhow we're using games today.\n\n00:13:34.684 --> 00:13:37.391\nWe're using games to escape\nreal-world suffering --\n\n00:13:37.415 --> 00:13:39.006\nwe're using games to get away\n\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.619\nfrom everything that's broken\nin the real environment,\n\n00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:44.189\neverything that's not satisfying\nabout real life,\n\n00:13:44.213 --> 00:13:46.311\nand we're getting what we need from games.\n\n00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:47.934\nBut it doesn't have to end there.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.934\nThis is really exciting.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.934\nAccording to Herodotus, after 18 years\nthe famine wasn't getting better,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:58.398\nso the king decided they would\nplay one final dice game.\n\n00:13:59.366 --> 00:14:01.739\nThey divided the entire kingdom in half.\n\n00:14:02.127 --> 00:14:03.835\nThey played one dice game,\n\n00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:07.278\nand the winners of that game\ngot to go on an epic adventure.\n\n00:14:07.302 --> 00:14:08.934\nThey would leave Lydia,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.933\nand they would go out in search\nof a new place to live,\n\n00:14:11.957 --> 00:14:14.157\nleaving behind just enough people\n\n00:14:14.181 --> 00:14:16.474\nto survive on the resources\nthat were available,\n\n00:14:16.498 --> 00:14:20.323\nand hopefully to take their civilization\nsomewhere else where they could thrive.\n\n00:14:20.347 --> 00:14:22.246\nNow, this sounds crazy, right?\n\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.688\nBut recently, DNA evidence\nhas shown that the Etruscans,\n\n00:14:26.712 --> 00:14:28.474\nwho then led to the Roman Empire,\n\n00:14:28.498 --> 00:14:31.403\nactually share the same DNA\nas the ancient Lydians.\n\n00:14:31.427 --> 00:14:33.934\nAnd so, recently,\nscientists have suggested\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.355\nthat Herodotus' crazy\nstory is actually true.\n\n00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:39.348\nAnd geologists have found\nevidence of a global cooling\n\n00:14:39.372 --> 00:14:43.108\nthat lasted for nearly 20 years,\nthat could have explained the famine.\n\n00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:45.362\nSo this crazy story might be true.\n\n00:14:45.386 --> 00:14:49.282\nThey might have actually saved\ntheir culture by playing games,\n\n00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.228\nescaping to games for 18 years,\n\n00:14:51.252 --> 00:14:52.704\nand then been so inspired,\n\n00:14:52.728 --> 00:14:55.410\nand knew so much about\nhow to come together with games,\n\n00:14:55.434 --> 00:14:58.171\nthat they actually saved\nthe entire civilization that way.\n\n00:14:58.195 --> 00:14:59.360\nOkay, we can do that.\n\n00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:00.406\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.768\nWe've been playing Warcraft since 1994.\n\n00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:06.463\nThat was the first real-time strategy\ngame from the World of Warcraft series.\n\n00:15:06.487 --> 00:15:07.886\nThat was 16 years ago.\n\n00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:10.091\nThey played dice games for 18 years,\n\n00:15:10.115 --> 00:15:12.361\nwe've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.\n\n00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:15.543\nI say we are ready for our own epic game.\n\n00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:20.177\nNow, they had half the civilization\ngo off in search of a new world,\n\n00:15:20.201 --> 00:15:24.050\nso that's where I get my 21 billion\nhours a week of game-play from.\n\n00:15:24.074 --> 00:15:25.934\nLet's get half of us to agree\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.934\nto spend an hour a day playing games,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.800\nuntil we solve real-world problems.\n\n00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:31.396\nNow, I know you're asking,\n\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.099\n\"How are we going to solve\nreal-world problems in games?\"\n\n00:15:34.123 --> 00:15:37.234\nWell, that's what I've devoted\nmy work to over the past few years,\n\n00:15:37.258 --> 00:15:38.934\nat the Institute for the Future.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.244\nWe have this banner\nin our offices in Palo Alto,\n\n00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:45.093\nand it expresses our view of how\nwe should try to relate to the future.\n\n00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.664\nWe do not want to try\nto predict the future.\n\n00:15:47.688 --> 00:15:49.720\nWhat we want to do is make the future.\n\n00:15:49.744 --> 00:15:52.236\nWe want to imagine\nthe best-case scenario outcome,\n\n00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.934\nand then we want to empower people\nto make that outcome a reality.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.934\nWe want to imagine epic wins,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.934\nand then give people the means\nto achieve the epic win.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.056\nI'm just going to very briefly show you\nthree games that I've made\n\n00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.136\nthat are an attempt to give people\nthe means to create epic wins\n\n00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.493\nin their own futures.\n\n00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:09.934\nThis is World Without Oil.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.649\nWe made this game in 2007.\n\n00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:13.031\nThis is an online game\n\n00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.775\nin which you try to survive\nan oil shortage.\n\n00:16:16.465 --> 00:16:18.060\nThe oil shortage is fictional,\n\n00:16:18.084 --> 00:16:20.934\nbut we put enough online content out there\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.638\nfor you to believe that it's real,\n\n00:16:22.662 --> 00:16:25.548\nand to live your real life\nas if we've run out of oil.\n\n00:16:25.572 --> 00:16:27.008\nSo when you come to the game,\n\n00:16:27.032 --> 00:16:28.961\nyou sign up, tell us where you live,\n\n00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:31.325\nand then we give you\nreal-time news videos,\n\n00:16:31.349 --> 00:16:34.469\ndata feeds that show you\nexactly how much oil costs,\n\n00:16:34.493 --> 00:16:37.222\nwhat's not available, how food\nsupply is being affected,\n\n00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:39.080\nhow transportation is being affected,\n\n00:16:39.104 --> 00:16:41.175\nif schools are closed, if there's rioting,\n\n00:16:41.199 --> 00:16:44.048\nand you have to figure out\nhow you would live your real life\n\n00:16:44.072 --> 00:16:45.311\nas if this were true.\n\n00:16:45.335 --> 00:16:47.134\nAnd then we ask you to blog about it,\n\n00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:48.934\nto post videos, to post photos.\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:52.358\nWe piloted this game\nwith 1,700 players in 2007,\n\n00:16:52.382 --> 00:16:54.715\nand we've tracked them\nfor the three years since.\n\n00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:57.816\nAnd I can tell you that this\nis a transformative experience.\n\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.723\nNobody wants to change how they live,\n\n00:16:59.747 --> 00:17:03.149\njust because it's good for the world,\nor because we're supposed to.\n\n00:17:03.476 --> 00:17:05.934\nBut if you immerse them\nin an epic adventure\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.934\nand tell them, \"We've run out of oil.\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:11.223\nThis is an amazing story\nand adventure for you to go on.\n\n00:17:11.247 --> 00:17:13.934\nChallenge yourself to see\nhow you would survive,\"\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.006\nmost of our players\nhave kept up the habits\n\n00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.826\nthat they learned in this game.\n\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.934\nSo for the next world-saving game,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:22.934\nwe decided to aim higher --\nbigger problem than just peak oil.\n\n00:17:23.453 --> 00:17:26.835\nWe did a game called Superstruct\nat the Institute for the Future.\n\n00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.934\nAnd the premise was,\na supercomputer has calculated\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.934\nthat humans have only 23 years\nleft on the planet.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:34.507\nThis supercomputer was called\n\n00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.934\nthe Global Extinction\nAwareness System, of course.\n\n00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:38.934\nWe asked people to come online --\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.057\nalmost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.\n\n00:17:41.081 --> 00:17:43.934\nYou know Jerry Bruckheimer\nmovies, you form a dream team --\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.709\nyou've got the astronaut,\nthe scientist, the ex-convict,\n\n00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:49.170\nand they all have something\nto do to save the world.\n\n00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.201\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:50.225 --> 00:17:53.613\nBut in our game, instead of just having\nfive people on the dream team,\n\n00:17:53.637 --> 00:17:55.566\nwe said, \"Everybody's on the dream team,\n\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.934\nand it's your job to invent\nthe future of energy,\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.934\nthe future of food, the future of health,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.006\nthe future of security and the future\nof the social safety net.\"\n\n00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.619\nWe had 8,000 people\nplay that game for eight weeks.\n\n00:18:05.643 --> 00:18:08.691\nThey came up with 500\ninsanely creative solutions\n\n00:18:08.715 --> 00:18:11.254\nthat you can go online,\nGoogle \"Superstruct,\" and see.\n\n00:18:11.569 --> 00:18:12.934\nSo, finally, the last game,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.414\nwe're launching it March 3rd.\n\n00:18:14.438 --> 00:18:16.872\nThis is a game done\nwith the World Bank Institute.\n\n00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:18.100\nIf you complete the game,\n\n00:18:18.124 --> 00:18:20.934\nyou will be certified\nby the World Bank Institute\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:23.656\nas a Social Innovator, class of 2010.\n\n00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.934\nWorking with universities\nall over sub-Saharan Africa,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.934\nand we are inviting them\nto learn social innovation skills.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.934\nWe've got a graphic novel,\nwe've got leveling up\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.934\nin skills like local insight,\nknowledge networking,\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.959\nsustainability,\nvision and resourcefulness.\n\n00:18:38.443 --> 00:18:40.030\nI would like to invite all of you\n\n00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:42.189\nto please share this game\nwith young people,\n\n00:18:42.213 --> 00:18:44.934\nanywhere in the world,\nparticularly in developing areas,\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.156\nwho might benefit from coming together\n\n00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.889\nto try to start to imagine their own\nsocial enterprises to save the world.\n\n00:18:51.708 --> 00:18:53.121\nSo, I'm going to wrap up now.\n\n00:18:53.724 --> 00:18:54.934\nI want to ask a question.\n\n00:18:55.494 --> 00:18:56.978\nWhat do you think happens next?\n\n00:18:57.319 --> 00:18:59.987\nWe've got all these amazing gamers,\nwe've got these games\n\n00:19:00.011 --> 00:19:02.123\nthat are kind of pilots\nof what we might do,\n\n00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:04.353\nbut none of them\nhave saved the real world yet.\n\n00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:08.726\nWell I hope you will agree with me\nthat gamers are a human resource\n\n00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.934\nthat we can use to do real-world work,\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.177\nthat games are a powerful\nplatform for change.\n\n00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:15.527\nWe have all these amazing superpowers:\n\n00:19:15.551 --> 00:19:18.934\nblissful productivity, the ability\nto weave a tight social fabric,\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:22.934\nthis feeling of urgent optimism\nand the desire for epic meaning.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:26.467\nI really hope that we can come together\nto play games that matter,\n\n00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:28.717\nto survive on this planet\nfor another century.\n\n00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:32.393\nThat's my hope, that you will join me\nin making and playing games like this.\n\n00:19:32.417 --> 00:19:36.217\nWhen I look forward to the next decade,\nI know two things for sure:\n\n00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.934\nthat we can make\nany future we can imagine,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.068\nand we can play any games\nwe want, so I say:\n\n00:19:42.092 --> 00:19:43.808\nLet the world-changing games begin.\n\n00:19:43.832 --> 00:19:44.990\nThank you.\n\n00:19:45.014 --> 00:19:49.188\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Medical miracle on Everest", "duration": "1249", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_kamler_medical_miracle_on_everest", "transcript": "OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind. And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation, how the will to survive can bring that out in people. This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest. And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain. So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive.OK, this is Mount Everest. It's 29,035 feet high. I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic, making tectonic plate measurements; twice, I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices. It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake. And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen, and we should have listened to them. Everest is an extreme environment. There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level. Near the summit, temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero. You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour. It's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars. I remember one time being up near the summit, I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle, inside my down jacket, only to discover that the water was already frozen solid. That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit.OK, this is the route up Everest. It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet. Camp One, 2,000 feet higher. Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up, what's called the Western Cwm. CampThree is at the base of Lhotse, which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest. And then Camp Four is the highest camp; that's 3,000 feet short of the summit. This is a view of base camp. This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet. It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload. And this is what they unloaded for me: I had four yak loads of medical supplies, which are dumped in a tent, and here I am trying to arrange things.This was our expedition. It was a National Geographic expedition, but it was organized by The Explorers Club. There were three other expeditions on the mountain, an American team, a New Zealand team and an IMAX team. And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp. And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day. When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top. This is near the top of the icefall. You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen. That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you. These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up. This is me crossing a crevasse. We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached. That's another crevasse. Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it.Okay. This is Camp One. It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall. And from there we climb up to Camp Two, which is sort of the foreground. These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face, that mountain toward Camp Three. They're on fixed ropes here. A fall here, if you weren't roped in, would be 5,000 feet down. This is a view taken from camp three. You can see the Lhotse face is in profile, it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it, so you put the camp halfway through.If you notice, the summit of Everest is black. There's no ice over it. And that's because Everest is so high, it's in the jet stream, and winds are constantly scouring the face, so no snow gets to accumulate. What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit.This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four, moving in, up through the clouds. And this is at Camp Four. Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not. Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited, and you either have to go up or go down, make that decision very quickly. This is a picture of Rob Hall. He was the leader of the New Zealand team. This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about. These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit. They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit. This is not good weather to climb in, so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down. And, in fact, the wind does die down at night. It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all. This looks like a good chance to go for the summit. So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face. It's the first part of climb. It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next, and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.So that's what happened. The climbers got on the southeast ridge. This is the view looking at the southeast ridge. The summit would be in the foreground. From here, it's about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit. But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up. A storm blew in that no one was anticipating. You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit. And there were climbers on that summit ridge.This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before, and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather. I have an oxygen hose connected here. You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack \u2014 little titanium tanks, very lightweight \u2014 and we're not carrying much else. This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself. This is on the way toward the summit, on that 1,500-foot bridge. All the climbers here are climbing unroped, and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody, you'd wind up just pulling them off with you. So each person climbs individually. And it's not a straight path at all, it's very difficult climbing, and there's always the risk of falling on either side. If you fall to your left, you're going to fall 8,000 feet into Nepal; if you fall to your right, you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet. So it's probably better to fall into Tibet because you'll live longer. (Laughter) But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.OK. Those climbers were up near the summit, along that summit ridge that you see up there, and I was down here in Camp Three. My expedition was down in Camp Three, while these guys were up there in the storm. The storm was so fierce that we had to lay, fully dressed, fully equipped, laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain. It was the worst winds I've ever seen. And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher, and completely exposed to the elements. We were in radio contact with some of them.This is a view taken along the summit ridge. Rob Hall, we heard by radio, was up here, at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen. And we heard that Rob was OK, but Doug was too weak to come down. He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him. We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers, another climber, had collapsed in the snow and was dead. There were still 18 other climbers that we weren't aware of their condition. They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain; all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting. We really had no idea what was going on during that storm. We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three.Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans, decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going. They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall, who was a superb climber stuck, sort of, with a weak climber up near the summit. I expected them to say to Rob, \"Hold on. We're coming.\" But in fact, what they said was, \"Leave Doug and come down yourself. There's no chance of saving him, and just try to save yourself at this point.\" And Rob got that message, but his answer was, \"We're both listening.\" Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here, and it was a scene of complete chaos up there. But they did what they could to stabilize the people. I gave them radio advice from Camp Three, and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power. The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four. So the climbers were coming down along this route.This is taken from Camp Three, where I was. And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them, which is really not much, because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle. You can barely stand outside the tent. It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet. The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids.So, as the climbers came by me, I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down. The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated, I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain. It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes. It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there.While I was taking care of them, we got more news about Rob Hall. There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him. He called in to say that he was alone now. Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain. But Rob was now too weak to come down himself, and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude, he was just beyond rescue and he knew it. At that point, he asked to be paged into his wife. He was carrying a radio. His wife was home in New Zealand, seven months pregnant with their first child, and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done, and Rob and his wife had their last conversation. They picked the name for their baby. Rob then signed off, and that was the last we ever heard of him.I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet, which was an impossibility. So what we did was, we got the victims down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them. This was my medical kit. It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies. This is what I carried up the mountain. I had more supplies lower down, which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp. And this was scene at the lower camp.The survivors came in one by one. Some of them were hypothermic, some of them were frostbitten, some were both. What we did was try to warm them up as best we could, put oxygen on them and try to revive them, which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet, when the tent is freezing. This is some severe frostbite on the feet, severe frostbite on the nose. This climber was snow blind.As I was taking care of these climbers, we got a startling experience. Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers, who we had already been told was dead, stumbled into the tent, just like a mummy, he walked into the tent. I expected him to be incoherent, but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me, \"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?\" And then he said, \"Do you accept my health insurance?\" (Laughter) He really said that. (Laughter) So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten. You can see his hand is completely white; his face, his nose, is burned. First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis, it turns black, and then it falls off. It's the last stage, just like a scar.So, as I was taking care of Beck, he related what had been going on up there. He said he had gotten lost in the storm, collapsed in the snow, and just laid there, unable to move. Some climbers had come by and looked at him, and he heard them say, \"He's dead.\" But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that, but he was completely unable to move. He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings, but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive. So the climbers passed him by, and Beck lay there for a day, a night and another day, in the snow. And then he said to himself, \"I don't want to die. I have a family to come back to.\" And the thoughts of his family, his kids and his wife, generated enough energy, enough motivation in him, so that he actually got up. After laying in the snow that long a time, he got up and found his way back to the camp. And Beck told me that story very quietly, but I was absolutely stunned by it. I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up. He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia. And I can only try to speculate on how he did it.So, what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan, something that could actually measure brain function? Just very simply, the three parts of the brain: the frontal lobe, where you focus your attention and concentration; you have the temporal lobe, where you form images and keep memories; and the posterior part of your brain, which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion; and the brain stem, where you have your basic maintenance functions, like heartbeat and respiration.So let's take a cut through the brain here, and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan. This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain. So you have the prefrontal cortex here, lighting up in red. This is a pretty evenly distributed scan. You have the middle area, where the temporal lobe might be, in here, and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.This is a roughly normal scan, showing equal distribution of energy. Now, you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up. This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he's in danger. He's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble. These parts of the brain are quieting down. He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point, and he's working pretty hard. He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this. OK, but he's losing ground here. He's running out of energy. It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going, and, you see, there's no more red here; his brain is quieting down. He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet, there's very little red anywhere. Beck is powering down. He's dying.You go on to the next scan, but, in Beck's case, you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again. He's beginning to think about his family. He's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up. He's developing energy in this area through thought. And this is how he's going to turn thought back into action. This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus. It's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists. This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower. And, you can see, there's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain, where he's got images of his family, into this area, which is powering his will.Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it's actually going to be a motivating factor. He's going to develop enough energy in that area \u2014 after a day, a night and a day \u2014 to actually motivate himself to get up. And you can see here, he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe. He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now. He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself. So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain, and it's getting quieter down here, but he's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going. And then, that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas. He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated. This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving, and he's going to be pacing himself. His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed. So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic.So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet, and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself. It just shows you what the power of the mind can do. He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients; luckily, we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys. A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history. It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck and the other survivors, one by one, and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp.This is a scene at base camp, at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost. And we had a memorial service there a few days later. These are Serphas lighting juniper branches. They believe juniper smoke is holy. And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit, turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly. There were five climbers lost here. This was Scott Fischer, Rob Hall, Andy Harris, Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba. And one more climber should have died that day, but didn't, and that's Beck Weathers. He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower, he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself.These are Tibetan prayer flags. These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags, the message will be carried up to the gods, and that year, Beck's message was answered.Thank you.

Hyakutake.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd the Sherpas told us then\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthat was a very bad omen,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nand we should have listened to them.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nEverest is an extreme environment.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThere's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nNear the summit, temperatures\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\ncan be 40 degrees below zero.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nYou can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nIt's actually a wind-chill factor\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nwhich is lower than a summer day on Mars.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nI remember one time being up near the summit,\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nI reached into my down jacket\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nfor a drink from my water bottle,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\ninside my down jacket,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nonly to discover that the water was already frozen solid.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThat gives you an idea of just how severe\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthings are near the summit.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nOK, this is the route up Everest.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIt starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nCamp One, 2,000 feet higher.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nCamp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhat's called the Western Cwm.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nCampThree is at the base of Lhotse,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nwhich is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd then Camp Four is the highest camp;\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthat's 3,000 feet short of the summit.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nThis is a view of base camp.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nThis is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nIt's the highest point you can bring your yaks\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nbefore you have to unload.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nAnd this is what they unloaded for me:\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nI had four yak loads of medical supplies,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nwhich are dumped in a tent,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nand here I am trying to arrange things.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThis was our expedition.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nIt was a National Geographic expedition,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbut it was organized by The Explorers Club.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nThere were three other expeditions on the mountain,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nan American team, a New Zealand team\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand an IMAX team.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAnd, after actually two months of preparation,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe built our camps all the way up the mountain.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nThis is a view looking up the icefall,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthe first 2,000 feet of the climb\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nup from base camp.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd here's a picture in the icefall;\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nit's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nand it actually changes every day.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nWhen you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nyou can't even see over the top.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThis is near the top of the icefall.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nYou want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThat way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThese are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThis is me crossing a crevasse.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nWe cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nThat's another crevasse.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSome of these things are 10 stories deep or more,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nand one of my climbing friends says that\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthe reason we actually climb at night\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nis because if we ever saw the bottom\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nof what we're climbing over,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwe would never do it.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nOkay. This is Camp One.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt's the first flat spot you can reach\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nafter you get up to the top of the icefall.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd from there we climb up to Camp Two,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nwhich is sort of the foreground.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThese are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nthat mountain toward Camp Three.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThey're on fixed ropes here.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nA fall here, if you weren't roped in,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwould be 5,000 feet down.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThis is a view taken from camp three.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nYou can see the Lhotse face is in profile,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nit's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nso you put the camp halfway through.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nIf you notice, the summit of Everest is black.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThere's no ice over it.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd that's because Everest is so high,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nit's in the jet stream,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nand winds are constantly scouring the face,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nso no snow gets to accumulate.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nWhat looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nis actually snow being blown off the summit.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThis is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nmoving in, up through the clouds.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAnd this is at Camp Four.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nOnce you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nto decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nEverybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand you either have to go up or go down,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nmake that decision very quickly.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThis is a picture of Rob Hall.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nHe was the leader of the New Zealand team.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nThis is a radio he used later to call his wife\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nthat I'll tell you about.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThese are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nThey're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThis is not good weather to climb in,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nso the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd, in fact, the wind does die down at night.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nIt becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nThis looks like a good chance to go for the summit.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo here are some climbers starting out for the summit\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\non what's called the Triangular Face.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIt's the first part of climb.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nIt's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nand you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo that's what happened.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nThe climbers got on the southeast ridge.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis is the view looking at the southeast ridge.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nThe summit would be in the foreground.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nFrom here, it's about 1,500 feet\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nup at a 30-degree angle to the summit.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBut what happened that year was\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthe wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nA storm blew in that no one was anticipating.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nYou can see here some ferocious winds\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nblowing snow way high off the summit.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd there were climbers on that summit ridge.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nThis is a picture of me in that area\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\ntaken a year before,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand you can see I've got an oxygen mask on\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nwith a rebreather.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nI have an oxygen hose connected here.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nYou can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nlittle titanium tanks, very lightweight --\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand we're not carrying much else.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThis is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nOK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nThis is on the way toward the summit,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\non that 1,500-foot bridge.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAll the climbers here are climbing unroped,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nand the reason is because\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nthe drop off is so sheer on either side\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nthat if you were roped to somebody,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nyou'd wind up just pulling them off with you.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nSo each person climbs individually.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nAnd it's not a straight path at all,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nit's very difficult climbing,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nand there's always the risk\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nof falling on either side.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nIf you fall to your left, you're going to fall\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\n8,000 feet into Nepal;\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nif you fall to your right,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nyou're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nSo it's probably better to fall into Tibet\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nbecause you'll live longer.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nBut, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nOK. Those climbers were up near the summit,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nalong that summit ridge that you see up there,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand I was down here in Camp Three.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nMy expedition was down in Camp Three,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nwhile these guys were up there in the storm.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThe storm was so fierce that we had to lay,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nfully dressed, fully equipped,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nlaid out on the tent floor\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nto stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nIt was the worst winds I've ever seen.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd the climbers up on the ridge\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nwere that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nand completely exposed to the elements.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nWe were in radio contact with some of them.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThis is a view taken along the summit ridge.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nRob Hall, we heard by radio,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwas up here, at this point in the storm\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwith Doug Hansen.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd we heard that Rob was OK,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbut Doug was too weak to come down.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nHe was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nWe also got some bad news in the storm\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nthat Beck Weathers, another climber,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nhad collapsed in the snow and was dead.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThere were still 18 other climbers\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat we weren't aware of their condition.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nThey were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nall the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nWe really had no idea what was going on during that storm.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nWe were just hunkered down\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nin our tents at Camp Three.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nOur two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\ndecided to go up to try to rescue who they could\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\neven though there was a ferocious storm going.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThey tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwho was a superb climber\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nstuck, sort of, with a weak climber\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nup near the summit.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI expected them to say to Rob,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\n\"Hold on. We're coming.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nBut in fact, what they said was,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\n\"Leave Doug and come down yourself.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThere's no chance of saving him,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand just try to save yourself at this point.\"\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd Rob got that message,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nbut his answer was,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\n\"We're both listening.\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nTodd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand it was a scene of complete chaos up there.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nBut they did what they could to stabilize the people.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nI gave them radio advice from Camp Three,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand we sent down the climbers that could make it down\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nunder their own power.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThe ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo the climbers were coming down along this route.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is taken from Camp Three, where I was.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nAnd they all came by me\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nso I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nwhich is really not much, because Camp Three\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nis a little notch cut in the ice\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nin the middle of a 45-degree angle.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nYou can barely stand outside the tent.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThe only supplies I had at that altitude\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nwere two plastic bags\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nwith preloaded syringes\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nof painkiller and steroids.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nSo, as the climbers came by me,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nI sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nto continue on further down.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThe ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nI would give an injection of steroids\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nto try to give them some period\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nof lucidity and coordination\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwhere they could then work their way further down the mountain.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nIt's so awkward to work up there that sometimes\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nI even gave the injections right through their clothes.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nIt was just too hard to maneuver\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nany other way up there.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWhile I was taking care of them,\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwe got more news about Rob Hall.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nThere was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nHe called in to say that he was alone now.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nApparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nBut Rob was now too weak to come down himself,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nhe was just beyond rescue\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand he knew it.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAt that point, he asked\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nto be paged into his wife.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nHe was carrying a radio.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nHis wife was home in New Zealand,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nseven months pregnant with their first child,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nand Rob and his wife\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nhad their last conversation.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nThey picked the name for their baby.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nRob then signed off,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nand that was the last we ever heard of him.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nI was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nat 24,000 feet,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nwhich was an impossibility.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nSo what we did was, we got the victims\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\ndown to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThis was my medical kit.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nIt's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThis is what I carried up the mountain.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nI had more supplies lower down,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nwhich I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd this was scene at the lower camp.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThe survivors came in one by one.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nSome of them were hypothermic,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nsome of them were frostbitten, some were both.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nWhat we did was try to warm them up as best we could,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nput oxygen on them and try to revive them,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwhich is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nwhen the tent is freezing.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThis is some severe frostbite on the feet,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nsevere frostbite on the nose.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThis climber was snow blind.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nAs I was taking care of these climbers,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwe got a startling experience.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nOut of nowhere, Beck Weathers,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nwho we had already been told was dead,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nstumbled into the tent,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\njust like a mummy, he walked into the tent.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nI expected him to be incoherent,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nbut, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\n\"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?\"\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd then he said,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n\"Do you accept my health insurance?\"\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nHe really said that.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nSo he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nYou can see his hand is completely white;\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nhis face, his nose, is burned.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nFirst, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nit turns black, and then it falls off.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nIt's the last stage, just like a scar.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo, as I was taking care of Beck,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nhe related what had been going on up there.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nHe said he had gotten lost in the storm,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\ncollapsed in the snow,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nand just laid there, unable to move.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nSome climbers had come by and looked at him,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand he heard them say, \"He's dead.\"\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nbut he was completely unable to move.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nHe was in some sort of catatonic state\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nwhere he could be aware of his surroundings,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nbut couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nSo the climbers passed him by,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand Beck lay there for a day, a night\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nand another day,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nin the snow.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd then he said to himself,\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\n\"I don't want to die.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nI have a family to come back to.\"\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd the thoughts of his family,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nhis kids and his wife,\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\ngenerated enough energy,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nenough motivation in him,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nso that he actually got up.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAfter laying in the snow that long a time,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nhe got up and found his way back to the camp.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nAnd Beck told me that story very quietly,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nbut I was absolutely stunned by it.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nI couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nthat long a time\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand then getting up.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nHe apparently reversed\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nan irreversible hypothermia.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd I can only try to speculate\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\non how he did it.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo, what if we had Beck\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nhooked up to a SPECT scan,\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nsomething that could actually measure brain function?\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nJust very simply, the three parts of the brain:\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nthe frontal lobe, where you focus\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nyour attention and concentration;\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nyou have the temporal lobe,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nwhere you form images and keep memories;\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand the posterior part of your brain,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nwhich contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand the brain stem,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwhere you have your basic maintenance functions,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nlike heartbeat and respiration.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nSo let's take a cut through the brain here,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand imagine that Beck\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nwas hooked up to a SPECT scan.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nThis measures dynamic blood flow\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nand therefore energy flow within the brain.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nSo you have the prefrontal cortex here,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nlighting up in red.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nThis is a pretty evenly distributed scan.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nYou have the middle area,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nwhere the temporal lobe might be, in here,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nThis is a roughly normal scan,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nshowing equal distribution of energy.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nNow, you go to this one and you see how much more\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nthe frontal lobes are lighting up.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nThis might be what Beck would be experiencing\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nwhen he realizes he's in danger.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nHe's focusing all his attention\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\non getting himself out of trouble.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nThese parts of the brain are quieting down.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nHe's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand he's working pretty hard.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nHe's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nOK, but he's losing ground here.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nHe's running out of energy.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nIt's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nand, you see, there's no more red here;\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nhis brain is quieting down.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nHe's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nthere's very little red anywhere.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nBeck is powering down.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nHe's dying.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nYou go on to the next scan,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nbut, in Beck's case,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nyou can see that the middle part of his brain\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nis beginning to light up again.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nHe's beginning to think about his family.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nHe's beginning to have images\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nthat are motivating him to get up.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nHe's developing energy in this area\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nthrough thought.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nAnd this is how he's going to turn thought\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nback into action.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nThis part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nIt's an area in which\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\na lot of neuroscientists believe\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nthe seat of will exists.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThis is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nAnd, you can see, there's an energy flow\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\ngoing from the mid portion of his brain,\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nwhere he's got images of his family,\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\ninto this area, which is powering his will.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nOkay. This is getting stronger and stronger\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nto the point where it's actually\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\ngoing to be a motivating factor.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nHe's going to develop enough energy in that area --\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nafter a day, a night and a day --\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nto actually motivate himself to get up.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nAnd you can see here,\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nhe's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nHe's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nHe's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nSo this energy has been transmitted\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nup toward the front of his brain,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand it's getting quieter down here,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nbut he's using this energy\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nto think about what he has to do to get himself going.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nAnd then, that energy is sort of spreading\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nthroughout his thought areas.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nHe's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nThis is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nand he's going to be pacing himself.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nHis heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nSo this is what I can speculate might have been going on\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nhad we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nduring this survival epic.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nSo here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nand I felt what I was doing was completely trivial\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\ncompared to what he had done for himself.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nIt just shows you what the power of the mind can do.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nHe was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nluckily, we were able to get a helicopter\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nin to rescue these guys.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nA helicopter came in at 21,000 feet\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nand carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nIt was able to land on the ice, take away Beck\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nand the other survivors, one by one,\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nand get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nbefore we even got back to base camp.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nThis is a scene at base camp,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nat one of the camps\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nwhere some of the climbers were lost.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nAnd we had a memorial service there\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\na few days later.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nThese are Serphas lighting juniper branches.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nThey believe juniper smoke is holy.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nAnd the climbers stood around on the high rocks\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nand spoke of the climbers who were lost\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nup near the summit,\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nturning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nThere were five climbers lost here.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nThis was Scott Fischer,\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nRob Hall,\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nAndy Harris,\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nDoug Hansen\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nand Yasuko Namba.\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nAnd one more climber\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nshould have died that day, but didn't,\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nand that's Beck Weathers.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nHe was able to survive\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nbecause he was able to generate that incredible willpower,\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nhe was able to use all the power of his mind\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nto save himself.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:23.958\nThese are Tibetan prayer flags.\n\n00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958\nThese Sherpas believe that\n\n00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.958\nif you write prayers on these flags,\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nthe message will be carried up to the gods,\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nand that year, Beck's message was answered.\n\n00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nThank you.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "We are the stories we tell ourselves", "duration": "1274", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/shekhar_kapur_we_are_the_stories_we_tell_ourselves", "transcript": "So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called \"Elizabeth.\" And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying, \"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything. How are we going to introduce her?\" So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer, and they came to me and said, \"Shekhar, what do you think?\"And I said, \"I think she's dancing.\"And I could see everybody looked at me, somebody said, \"Bollywood.\"The other said, \"How much did we hire him for?\"And the third said, \"Let's find another director.\"I thought I had better change. So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth, and I said, \"OK, maybe I am too Bollywood. Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing? What are you talking about?\" So I rethought the whole thing, and then we all came to a consensus. And here was the introduction of this great British icon called \"Elizabeth.\"Leicester: May I join you, my lady?Elizabeth: If it please you, sir. (Music)Shekhar Kapur: So she was dancing. So how many people who saw the film did not get that here was a woman in love, that she was completely innocent and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful? And how many of you did not get that? That's the power of visual storytelling, that's the power of dance, that's the power of music: the power of not knowing.When I go out to direct a film, every day we prepare too much, we think too much. Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom. You know, simple words lost in the quicksand of experience. So I come up, and I say, \"What am I going to do today?\" I'm not going to do what I planned to do, and I put myself into absolute panic. It's my one way of getting rid of my mind, getting rid of this mind that says, \"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing. You're a director, you've done it for years.\" So I've got to get there and be in complete panic. It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script, I go and I panic myself, I get scared. I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous, I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says, \"You know what you're going to do, sir.\" I say, \"Of course I do.\"And the studio executives, they would say, \"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.\" And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan because he's chaotic. I'm allowing myself to go into chaos because out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come. All preparation is preparation. I don't even know if it's honest. I don't even know if it's truthful. The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically, and if you get five great moments of great, organic stuff in your storytelling, in your film, your film, audiences will get it. So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there and saying, \"I don't know what to say.\"So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you, 200 people at seven in the morning who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven, and everybody's saying, \"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?\" And you put yourself into a state of panic where you don't know, and so you don't know. And so, because you don't know, you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe that something \u2014 I'm going to try and access the universe the way Einstein \u2014 say a prayer \u2014 accessed his equations, the same source. I'm looking for the same source because creativity comes from absolutely the same source that you meditate somewhere outside yourself, outside the universe. You're looking for something that comes and hits you. Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot. So what do you do?So Cate says, \"Shekhar, what do you want me to do?\"And I say, \"Cate, what do you want to do?\" (Laughter) \"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors \u2014 why don't you show me what you want to do?\" (Laughter) What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time. I'm trying to buy time.So the first thing about storytelling that I learned, and I follow all the time is: Panic. Panic is the great access of creativity because that's the only way to get rid of your mind. Get rid of your mind. Get out of it, get it out. And let's go to the universe because there's something out there that is more truthful than your mind, that is more truthful than your universe. [unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it because that's what I follow constantly to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness. Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity. So that's what I do.When I was a kid \u2014 I was about eight years old. You remember how India was. There was no pollution. In Delhi, we used to live \u2014 we used to call it a chhat or the khota. Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace \u2014 and we used to sleep out at night. At school I was being just taught about physics, and I was told that if there is something that exists, then it is measurable. If it is not measurable, it does not exist. And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky, as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid, and I used to stare at the universe and say, \"How far does this universe go?\"My father was a doctor. And I would think, \"Daddy, how far does the universe go?\"And he said, \"Son, it goes on forever.\"So I said, \"Please measure forever because in school they're teaching me that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist. It doesn't come into my frame of reference.\" So, how far does eternity go? What does forever mean? And I would lie there crying at night because my imagination could not touch creativity.So what did I do? At that time, at the tender age of seven, I created a story. What was my story? And I don't know why, but I remember the story. There was a woodcutter who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood, and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax. And when that ax hits that piece of wood, that's when everything will destroy and the Big Bang will happen again. But all before that there was a woodcutter. And then when I would run out of that story, I would imagine that woodcutter's universe is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter. So every time, I could tell my story again and again and get over this problem, and so I got over the problem.How did I do it? Tell a story. So what is a story? A story is our \u2014 all of us \u2014 we are the stories we tell ourselves. In this universe, and this existence, where we live with this duality of whether we exist or not and who are we, the stories we tell ourselves are the stories that define the potentialities of our existence. We are the stories we tell ourselves. So that's as wide as we look at stories. A story is the relationship that you develop between who you are, or who you potentially are, and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.We tell our stories, and a person without a story does not exist. So Einstein told a story and followed his stories and came up with theories and came up with theories and then came up with his equations. Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him, and he went out to conquer the world. We all, everybody, has a story that they follow. We tell ourselves stories. So, I will go further, and I say, \"I tell a story, and therefore I exist.\" I exist because there are stories, and if there are no stories, we don't exist. We create stories to define our existence. If we do not create the stories, we probably go mad. I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.Now, a film. A film tells a story. I often wonder when I make a film \u2014 I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha \u2014 and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements that are given to a director \u2014 if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera \u2014 would we get Buddhism better? But that puts some kind of burden on me. I have to tell a story in a much more elaborate way, but I have the potential. It's called subtext. When I first went to Hollywood, they said \u2014 I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me, \"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?\" And I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Because nobody is going to give you a film if you talk about subtext. Just talk about plot and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film, what the visuals will be.\"So when I look at a film, here's what we look for: We look for a story on the plot level, then we look for a story on the psychological level, then we look for a story on the political level, then we look at a story on a mythological level. And I look for stories on each level. Now, it is not necessary that these stories agree with each other. What is wonderful is, at many times, the stories will contradict with each other. So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician, I often tell him, \"Don't follow what the script already says. Find that which is not. Find the truth for yourself, and when you find the truth for yourself, there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot, but don't worry about it.\"So, the sequel to \"Elizabeth,\" \"Golden Age.\" When I made the sequel to \"Elizabeth,\" here was a story that the writer was telling: A woman who was threatened by Philip II and was going to war, and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh. Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh, she was giving up the reasons she was a queen, and then Walter Raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting, and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted...Here's the story I was telling: The gods up there, there were two people. There was Philip II, who was divine because he was always praying, and there was Elizabeth, who was divine, but not quite divine because she thought she was divine, but the blood of being mortal flowed in her. But the divine one was unjust, so the gods said, \"OK, what we need to do is help the just one.\" And so they helped the just one. And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down to physically separate her mortal self from her spirit self. And the mortal self was the girl that Walter Raleigh was sent, and gradually he separated her so she was free to be divine. And the two divine people fought, and the gods were on the side of divinity.Of course, all the British press got really upset. They said, \"We won the Armada.\"But I said, \"But the storm won the Armada. The gods sent the storm.\"So what was I doing? I was trying to find a mythic reason to make the film. Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, \"What's the film about?\" She said, \"The film's about a woman coming to terms with growing older.\" Psychological. The writer said \"It's about history, plot.\" I said \"It's about mythology, the gods.\"So let me show you a film \u2014 a piece from that film \u2014 and how a camera also \u2014 so this is a scene, where in my mind, she was at the depths of mortality. She was discovering what mortality actually means, and if she is at the depths of mortality, what really happens. And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality and why she should break away from mortality. Remember, in the film, to me, both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body, one the mortal self and one the spirit self.So can we have that second?(Music)Elizabeth: Bess? Bess? Bess Throckmorton?Bess: Here, my lady.Elizabeth: Tell me, is it true? Are you with child? Are you with child?Bess: Yes, my lady.Elizabeth: Traitorous. You dare to keep secrets from me? You ask my permission before you rut, before you breed. My bitches wear my collars. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham. You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business. Is it his? Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?Bess: Yes. My lady, it is my husband's child. Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)Raleigh: Majesty. This is not the queen I love and serve.Elizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen, and she has married without royal consent. These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him. Go. You no longer have the queen's protection.Bess: As you wish, Majesty.Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out.(Music)Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here? Elizabeth has realized, and she's coming face-to-face with her own sense of jealousy, her own sense of mortality. What am I doing with the architecture? The architecture is telling a story. The architecture is telling a story about how, even though she's the most powerful woman in the world at that time, there is the other, the architecture's bigger. The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic. It'll survive her. So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny. Not only that, why is the camera looking down? The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well. She's in the absolute well of her own sense of being mortal. That's where she has to pull herself out from the depths of mortality, come in, release her spirit. And that's the moment where, in my mind, both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person. But that's the moment she's surgically removing herself from that. So the film is operating on many many levels in that scene. And how we tell stories visually, with music, with actors, and at each level it's a different sense and sometimes contradictory to each other. So how do I start all this? What's the process of telling a story?About ten years ago, I heard this little thing from a politician, not a politician that was very well respected in India. And he said that these people in the cities, in one flush, expend as much water as you people in the rural areas don't get for your family for two days. That struck a chord, and I said, \"That's true.\" I went to see a friend of mine, and he made me wait in his apartment in Malabar Hill on the twentieth floor, which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai. And he was having a shower for 20 minutes. I got bored and left, and as I drove out, I drove past the slums of Bombay, as you always do, and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun of women and children with buckets waiting for a tanker to come and give them water. And an idea started to develop. So how does that become a story? I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.So my next film is called \"Paani\" which means water. And now, out of the mythology of that, I'm starting to create a world. What kind of world do I create, and where does the idea, the design of that come? So, in my mind, in the future, they started to build flyovers. You understand flyovers? Yeah? They started to build flyovers to get from A to B faster, but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth. And then what they did was they created a city above the flyovers. And the rich people moved to the upper city and left the poorer people in the lower cities, about 10 to 12 percent of the people have moved to the upper city.Now, where does this upper city and lower city come? There's a mythology in India about \u2014 where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi, [Hindi] Right. What does that mean? It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders and survive on the shoulders of the poor. So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come. So the design has a story.And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city, they suck up all the water. Remember the word I said, suck up. They suck up all the water, keep to themselves, and they drip feed the lower city. And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water. And, because democracy still exists, there's a democratic way in which you say \"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water.\"So, okay my time is up. But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories, and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in, which is film. But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction. Everything's a contradiction. The universe is a contradiction. And all of us are constantly looking for harmony. When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction. But you get up at 4 a.m. That first blush of blue is where the night and day are trying to find harmony with each other. Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you, but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that. All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony. It's the effect of looking for harmony in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind, a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind. In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities. In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words, in the universe's mind, between day and night. In the mind of a man and a woman, we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female, we're looking for harmony within each other.The whole idea of contradiction, but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story, not the resolution. The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his, that we try to resolve the contradiction. Harmony is not resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution. Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment. Resolution is something that is far more limited. It is finite; harmony is infinite. So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe, is looking for harmony and infinity in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go, letting another go and creating a question that is really important.Thank you very much.

You know exactly what you're doing.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nYou're a director, you've done it for years.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nSo I've got to get there\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand be in complete panic.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nIt's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nI go and I panic myself, I get scared.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nI'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nI don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\n\"You know what you're going to do, sir.\" I say, \"Of course I do.\"\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd the studio executives, they would say,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\n\"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.\"\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nbecause he's chaotic.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI'm allowing myself to go into chaos\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nbecause out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAll preparation is preparation.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nI don't even know if it's honest.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nI don't even know if it's truthful.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThe truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nand if you get five great moments\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nof great, organic stuff\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nin your storytelling, in your film,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nyour film, audiences will get it.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nSo I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nand saying, \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nSo, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\n200 people at seven in the morning\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nwho got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand everybody's saying,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\n\"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd you put yourself into a state of panic\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nwhere you don't know, and so you don't know.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd so, because you don't know,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nyou're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthat something -- I'm going to try and access the universe\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthe way Einstein -- say a prayer --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\naccessed his equations,\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthe same source. I'm looking for the same source\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nbecause creativity comes from absolutely the same source\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat you meditate somewhere outside yourself,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\noutside the universe.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nYou're looking for something that comes and hits you.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nUntil that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nSo what do you do?\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nSo Cate says, \"Shekhar, what do you want me to do?\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd I say, \"Cate, what do you want to do?\" (Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\n\"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwhy don't you show me what you want to do?\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nWhat am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nI'm trying to buy time.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nSo the first thing about storytelling that I learned,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand I follow all the time is: Panic.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nPanic is the great access of creativity\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nbecause that's the only way to get rid of your mind.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nGet rid of your mind.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nGet out of it, get it out.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nAnd let's go to the universe because\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nthere's something out there that is more\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\ntruthful than your mind,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nthat is more truthful than your universe.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\n[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nbecause that's what I follow constantly\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nto find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nOut of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo that's what I do.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nWhen I was a kid -- I was about eight years old.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nYou remember how India was. There was no pollution.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nIn Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nKhota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nand we used to sleep out at night.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAt school I was being just taught about physics,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nand I was told that\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nif there is something that exists,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthen it is measurable.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nIf it is not measurable,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nit does not exist.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nas Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nand I used to stare at the universe and say,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\n\"How far does this universe go?\"\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nMy father was a doctor.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nAnd I would think, \"Daddy, how far does the universe go?\"\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd he said, \"Son, it goes on forever.\"\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nSo I said, \"Please measure forever\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nbecause in school they're teaching me\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nthat if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nIt doesn't come into my frame of reference.\"\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo, how far does eternity go?\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nWhat does forever mean?\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd I would lie there crying at night\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbecause my imagination could not touch creativity.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nSo what did I do?\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAt that time, at the tender age of seven,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nI created a story.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhat was my story?\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd I don't know why, but I remember the story.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nThere was a woodcutter\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwho's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nand the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd when that ax hits that piece of wood,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat's when everything will destroy\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand the Big Bang will happen again.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut all before that there was a woodcutter.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd then when I would run out of that story,\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nI would imagine that woodcutter's universe\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nis one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nSo every time, I could tell my story again and again\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand get over this problem,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand so I got over the problem.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nHow did I do it? Tell a story.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo what is a story?\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nA story is our -- all of us --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nwe are the stories we tell ourselves.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIn this universe, and this existence,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwhere we live with this duality\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nof whether we exist or not\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nand who are we,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthe stories we tell ourselves are the stories\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthat define the potentialities\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nof our existence.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWe are the stories we tell ourselves.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nSo that's as wide as we look at stories.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nA story is the relationship\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat you develop between who you are,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nor who you potentially are,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand the infinite world, and that's our mythology.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nWe tell our stories,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nand a person without a story does not exist.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nSo Einstein told a story\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand followed his stories and came up with theories\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand came up with theories and then came up with his equations.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAlexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand he went out to conquer the world.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nWe all, everybody, has a story that they follow.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nWe tell ourselves stories.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nSo, I will go further, and I say,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\n\"I tell a story, and therefore I exist.\"\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nI exist because there are stories,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand if there are no stories, we don't exist.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nWe create stories to define our existence.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIf we do not create the stories,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwe probably go mad.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nI don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nNow, a film.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nA film tells a story.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nI often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthat are given to a director --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nif he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwould we get Buddhism better?\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nBut that puts some kind of burden on me.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nI have to tell a story\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nin a much more elaborate way,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nbut I have the potential.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt's called subtext.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nWhen I first went to Hollywood, they said --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nI used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n\"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?\"\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"Because nobody is going to give you a film\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nif you talk about subtext.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nJust talk about plot\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nand say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nwhat the visuals will be.\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo when I look at a film,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nhere's what we look for:\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nWe look for a story on the plot level,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthen we look for a story\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\non the psychological level,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthen we look for a story on the political level,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nthen we look at a story\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\non a mythological level.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd I look for stories on each level.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nNow, it is not necessary\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nthat these stories agree with each other.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nWhat is wonderful is,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nat many times, the stories will contradict with each other.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nI often tell him, \"Don't follow what the script already says.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nFind that which is not.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nFind the truth for yourself,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand when you find the truth for yourself,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthere will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbut don't worry about it.\"\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo, the sequel to \"Elizabeth,\" \"Golden Age.\"\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nWhen I made the sequel to \"Elizabeth,\" here was a story that\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nthe writer was telling:\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nA woman who was threatened\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nby Philip II\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand was going to war,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nand was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nBecause she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nshe was giving up the reasons she was a queen,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand then Walter Raleigh\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nfell in love with her lady in waiting,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nand she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nor she wanted...\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nHere's the story I was telling:\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThe gods up there,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthere were two people.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nThere was Philip II, who was divine\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nbecause he was always praying,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nand there was Elizabeth, who was divine,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nbut not quite divine because she thought she was divine,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut the blood of being mortal flowed in her.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nBut the divine one was unjust,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nso the gods said,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\n\"OK, what we need to do is\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nhelp the just one.\"\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd so they helped the just one.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nto physically separate her mortal self\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nfrom her spirit self.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd the mortal self was the girl\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nthat Walter Raleigh was sent,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand gradually he separated her\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nso she was free to be divine.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd the two divine people fought,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand the gods were on the side of divinity.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nOf course, all the British press got really upset.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nThey said, \"We won the Armada.\"\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut I said, \"But the storm won the Armada.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThe gods sent the storm.\"\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo what was I doing?\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI was trying to find a mythic reason\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto make the film.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nOf course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, \"What's the film about?\"\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nShe said, \"The film's about a woman\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\ncoming to terms with growing older.\"\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nPsychological.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThe writer said \"It's about history, plot.\"\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nI said \"It's about mythology,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nthe gods.\"\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo let me show you a film --\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\na piece from that film --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nand how a camera also --\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nso this is a scene, where in my mind,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nshe was at the depths of mortality.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nShe was discovering what mortality actually means,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nand if she is at the depths of mortality,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nwhat really happens.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd she's recognizing the dangers of mortality\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand why she should break away from mortality.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nRemember, in the film, to me,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nboth her and her lady in waiting\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nwere parts of the same body,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\none the mortal self\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand one the spirit self.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo can we have that second?\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n(Music)\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nElizabeth: Bess?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nBess?\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nBess Throckmorton?\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nBess: Here, my lady.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nElizabeth: Tell me, is it true?\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAre you with child?\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAre you with child?\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nBess: Yes, my lady.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nElizabeth: Traitorous.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nYou dare to keep secrets from me?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nYou ask my permission before you rut,\n\n00:13:36.958 -->

Do you hear me?\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nWalsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nElizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nYou go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nIs it his?\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nTell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBess: Yes.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nMy lady,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nit is my husband's child.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nElizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nRaleigh: Majesty.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThis is not the queen I love and serve.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nElizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nand she has married without royal consent.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThese offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nGo.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nYou no longer have the queen's protection.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nBess: As you wish, Majesty.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nElizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nGet out.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\n(Music)\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nShekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nElizabeth has realized,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand she's coming face-to-face\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwith her own sense of jealousy,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nher own sense of mortality.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nWhat am I doing with the architecture?\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nThe architecture is telling a story.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nThe architecture is telling a story\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nabout how, even though she's the most powerful woman\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nin the world at that time,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthere is the other, the architecture's bigger.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThe stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nIt'll survive her.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nSo it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nNot only that, why is the camera looking down?\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThe camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nShe's in the absolute well\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nof her own sense of being mortal.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nThat's where she has to pull herself out\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nfrom the depths of mortality,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:05.958\ncome in, release her spirit.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nAnd that's the moment where, in my mind,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nboth Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nBut that's the moment\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nshe's surgically removing herself from that.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nSo the film is operating on\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nmany many levels in that scene.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nAnd how we tell stories\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:24.958\nvisually, with music, with actors,\n\n00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nand at each level it's a different sense\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand sometimes contradictory to each other.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nSo how do I start all this?\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nWhat's the process of telling a story?\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nAbout ten years ago,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nI heard this little thing from a politician,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nnot a politician that was very well respected in India.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nAnd he said that these people in the cities,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nin one flush, expend as much water\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nas you people in the rural areas\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.958\ndon't get for your family for two days.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nThat struck a chord, and I said, \"That's true.\"\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nI went to see a friend of mine,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nand he made me wait\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nin his apartment in Malabar Hill\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.958\non the twentieth floor,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nwhich is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nAnd he was having a shower for 20 minutes.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nI got bored and left, and as I drove out,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nI drove past the slums of Bombay,\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nas you always do,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nand I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nof women and children with buckets\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nwaiting for a tanker\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nto come and give them water.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nAnd an idea started to develop.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nSo how does that become a story?\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nI suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nSo my next film is called \"Paani\"\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nwhich means water.\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd now, out of the mythology of that,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nI'm starting to create a world.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nWhat kind of world do I create,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nand where does the idea, the design of that come?\n\n00:17:48.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nSo, in my mind, in the future,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nthey started to build flyovers.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nYou understand flyovers? Yeah?\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nThey started to build flyovers\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nto get from A to B faster,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nbut they effectively went from one area of relative wealth\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nto another area of relative wealth.\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nAnd then what they did was\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nthey created a city above the flyovers.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd the rich people moved to the upper city\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nand left the poorer people in the lower cities,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nabout 10 to 12 percent of the people\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nhave moved to the upper city.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nNow, where does this upper city and lower city come?\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nThere's a mythology in India about --\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwhere they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\n[Hindi]\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nRight. What does that mean?\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nIt says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nand survive on the shoulders of the poor.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nSo, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nSo the design has a story.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nAnd now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nthey suck up all the water.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nRemember the word I said, suck up.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nThey suck up all the water, keep to themselves,\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nand they drip feed the lower city.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nAnd if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nAnd, because democracy still exists,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nthere's a democratic way in which you say\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.958\n\"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water.\"\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nSo, okay my time is up.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nBut I can go on about telling you\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nhow we evolve stories,\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nand how stories effectively are who we are\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nand how these get translated into the particular discipline\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nthat I am in, which is film.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nBut ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nEverything's a contradiction.\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nThe universe is a contradiction.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd all of us are constantly looking for harmony.\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nWhen you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nBut you get up at 4 a.m.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nThat first blush of blue is where the night and day\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nare trying to find harmony with each other.\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nHarmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nbut somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nAll contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:46.958\nIt's the effect of looking for harmony\n\n00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nin the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.958\na contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nIn a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nIn a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nin the universe's mind, between day and night.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nIn the mind of a man and a woman,\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:04.958\nwe're looking constantly at\n\n00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nthe contradiction between male and female,\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nwe're looking for harmony within each other.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nThe whole idea of contradiction,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nbut the acceptance of contradiction\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.958\nis the telling of a story, not the resolution.\n\n00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nThe problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nand many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nthat we try to resolve the contradiction.\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nHarmony is not resolution.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:28.958\nHarmony is the suggestion of a thing\n\n00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nthat is much larger than resolution.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:32.958\nHarmony is the suggestion of something\n\n00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nthat is embracing and universal\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nand of eternity and of the moment.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:41.958\nResolution is something that is far more limited.\n\n00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:44.958\nIt is finite; harmony is infinite.\n\n00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nSo that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:50.958\nis looking for harmony and infinity\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.958\nin moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,\n\n00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nletting another go and creating a question that is really important.\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Science can answer moral questions", "duration": "1386", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right", "transcript": "I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values. Now, it's generally understood that questions of morality \u2014 questions of good and evil and right and wrong \u2014 are questions about which science officially has no opinion. It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value. And, consequently, most people \u2014 I think most people probably here \u2014 think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life: questions like, \"What is worth living for?\" \"What is worth dying for?\" \"What constitutes a good life?\"So, I'm going to argue that this is an illusion \u2014 that the separation between science and human values is an illusion \u2014 and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history. Now, it's often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values, because science deals with facts, and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres. It's often thought that there's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be. But I think this is quite clearly untrue. Values are a certain kind of fact. They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks? Why don't we feel compassion for rocks? It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering. Now, the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim: This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.And there's no notion, no version of human morality and human values that I've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes. Even if you get your values from religion, even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death \u2014 either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell \u2014 you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes. And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim, which, of course, may or may not be true.Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life, for human beings, we know that there is a continuum of such facts. We know that it's possible to live in a failed state, where everything that can go wrong does go wrong \u2014 where mothers cannot feed their children, where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration, where people are murdered indiscriminately. And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic, to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.And we know \u2014 we know \u2014 that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space. Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea? Probably not. Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye, so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not. There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish, whether or not we understand these truths. And morality relates to these truths.So, in talking about values we are talking about facts. Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels \u2014 from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements. But if we're going to talk about human well-being we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain. Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain \u2014whatever happens after death. Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality \u2014 his rather unfortunate personality \u2014 is the product of his brain. So the contributions of culture \u2014 if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing our brains. And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can, at least in principle, be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind \u2014 neuroscience, psychology, etc.So, what I'm arguing is that value's reduced to facts \u2014 to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings. And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings. And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape, with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures, both personal and collective. And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access, that few people access. And these await our discovery. Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual. Perhaps there are other states that we can't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them.Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space, or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question. I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child, or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense. (Laughter) But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them. And just admitting this \u2014 just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish \u2014 will change the way we talk about morality, and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future.For instance, there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal, where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard, and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin. And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally, are subjected to this every year. The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you. We're not talking about Connecticut.And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious. The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod, lest we spoil the child \u2014 this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23. But we can ask the obvious question: Is it a good idea, generally speaking, to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior? (Laughter) Is there any doubt that this question has an answer, and that it matters?Now, many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined, and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed. And so, how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being? Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health. The concept of physical health is undefined. As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years. When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30. It's now around 80 in the developed world. There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability. People will send you donations when you're in that condition. (Laughter)Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous. The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science. Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape: There may be equivalent ways to thrive; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing.Now, why wouldn't this undermine an objective morality? Well think of how we talk about food: I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat. There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food. But there's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison. The fact that there are many right answers to the question, \"What is food?\" does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition. Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie, it must always be wrong to lie, and if you can find an exception, well then there's no such thing as moral truth. Why would we think this? Consider, by analogy, the game of chess. Now, if you're going to play good chess, a principle like, \"Don't lose your Queen,\" is very good to follow. But it clearly admits some exceptions. There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do. There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do. And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity. The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all.Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere. Consider the great problem of women's bodies: What to do about them? Well this is one thing you can do about them: You can cover them up. Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community that while we may not like this, we might think of this as \"wrong\" in Boston or Palo Alto, who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags? And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable, or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?Well, who are we not to say this? Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this? I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil \u2014 women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned. But what does voluntary mean in a community where, when a girl gets raped, her father's first impulse, rather often, is to murder her out of shame?Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute: Your daughter gets raped, and what you want to do is kill her. What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing?Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society. For instance, this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world. Now, granted, for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images. (Laughter) But if we are in a reflective mood, we can ask, \"Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?\" I mean, is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children? Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance. (Applause) Perhaps there are many such places \u2014again, given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape. But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak. Now the irony, from my perspective, is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another.And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being. In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering. This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue. But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need a universal conception of human values.Now, what stands in the way of this? Well, one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality \u2014 especially secular, academic, scientist types. When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives. So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion, and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness. On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women.So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one's time. (Laughter) Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say, \"Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about \u2014 really right about \u2014 or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science. He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla. There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other.\" Notice that we don't do this in science.On the left you have Edward Witten. He's a string theorist. If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around, in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten. The other half will tell you they don't like the question. (Laughter) So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said,\"String theory is bogus. It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale. I'm not a fan.\" (Laughter) Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist; I don't understand string theory. I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory. (Laughter) I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.But this is just the point. Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded. That is what it is to have a domain of expertise. That is what it is for knowledge to count. How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise, or moral talent, or moral genius even? How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count? How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering? Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No. (Laughter) How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being? (Applause)So, this, I think, is what the world needs now. It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing, and morality relates to that domain of facts. It is possible for individuals, and even for whole cultures, to care about the wrong things, which is to say that it's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering. Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality. We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less, and they will one day mean nothing.We live in a world filled with destructive technology, and this technology cannot be uninvented; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them. It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads, or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes. We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life. And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers. Thank you very much. (Applause)Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there. Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world, hearing some of this, may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.Language seems to be really important here. When you're talking about the veil, you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags. I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women. And some of them would say something else. They would say, \"No, you know, this is a celebration of female specialness, it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that\" \u2014 and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view \u2014 \"that male lust is not to be trusted.\" I mean, can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence, watching the clock ticking, but the question is: What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations, and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don't veil yourself? And so, if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil, or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face \u2014 I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want, but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under. And so I think we shouldn't be so eager to always take their word for it, especially when it's 120 degrees out and you're wearing a full burqa.CA: A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress. But can you reconcile that? I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn't become one dimensional, where we all have to think the same. Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward, 100 years forward, how you would like to think of the world, balancing moral progress with richness.SH: Well, I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail, then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail. So, we're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion, and we're going to understand the factors that encourage it \u2014 whether they're genetic, whether they're how people talk to one another, whether they're economic systems, and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space.So, everything is not going to be up for grabs. It's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women. I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea \u2014 but at a certain point we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them. Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems? And I think there are clearly right answers to that.CA: And if the results come out that actually they do, are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues?SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact, that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system. So, you can say like, \"Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend, I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.\" If you get all those parts aligned, yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love. But again, then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context. It's all of us in this together, not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus.CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours. We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.SH: Really an honor. Thank you.

And if we're more\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nconcerned about our fellow primates\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nthan we are about insects, as indeed we are,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nit's because we think they're exposed to a greater range\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nof potential happiness and suffering.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nNow, the crucial thing to notice here\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nis that this is a factual claim:\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nThis is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nhave misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand the possibilities of experience\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nwell then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd there's no notion,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nno version of human morality\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand human values that I've ever come across\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthat is not at some point reducible\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nto a concern about conscious experience\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand its possible changes.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nEven if you get your values from religion,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\neven if you think that good and evil ultimately\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nrelate to conditions after death --\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\neither to an eternity of happiness with God\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nor an eternity of suffering in hell --\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nyou are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd to say that such changes can persist after death\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nis itself a factual claim,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nwhich, of course, may or may not be true.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, to speak about the conditions of well-being\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nin this life, for human beings,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nwe know that there is a continuum of such facts.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nWe know that it's possible to live in a failed state,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nwhere everything that can go wrong does go wrong --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwhere mothers cannot feed their children,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwhere strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nwhere people are murdered indiscriminately.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nAnd we know that it's possible to move along this continuum\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\ntowards something quite a bit more idyllic,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nto a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd we know -- we know --\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nthat there are right and wrong answers\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto how to move in this space.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWould adding cholera to the water be a good idea?\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nProbably not.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nso that when bad things happened to them\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nthey immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nThere are truths to be known\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nabout how human communities flourish,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhether or not we understand these truths.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd morality relates to these truths.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo, in talking about values we are talking about facts.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nNow, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nfrom the level of the genome\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\non up to the level of economic systems\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nand political arrangements.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nBut if we're going to talk about human well-being\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nBecause we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nis realized in the brain --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nwhatever happens after death.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nEven if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nin this life, his personality --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nhis rather unfortunate personality --\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nis the product of his brain.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo the contributions of culture --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nif culture changes us, as indeed it does,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nit changes us by changing our brains.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nAnd so therefore whatever cultural variation there is\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nin how human beings flourish\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\ncan, at least in principle, be understood\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nin the context of a maturing science of the mind --\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nneuroscience, psychology, etc.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nSo, what I'm arguing is that\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nvalue's reduced to facts --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nto facts about the conscious experience\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nof conscious beings.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd we can therefore visualize a space\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nof possible changes in the experience of these beings.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwith peaks and valleys that correspond\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nto differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nboth personal and collective.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd one thing to notice is that perhaps\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nthere are states of human well-being\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nthat we rarely access, that few people access.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nAnd these await our discovery.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nPerhaps some of these states can be appropriately called\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nmystical or spiritual.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nPerhaps there are other states that we can't access\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nbecause of how our minds are structured\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut other minds possibly could access them.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nNow, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nthat science is guaranteed to map this space,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nor that we will have scientific answers to every\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nconceivable moral question.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nI don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\na supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nor whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nor whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nBut if questions affect human well-being\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nthen they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nAnd just admitting this --\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\njust admitting that there are right and wrong answers\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nto the question of how humans flourish --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwill change the way we talk about morality,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand will change our expectations\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nof human cooperation in the future.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nFor instance, there are 21 states in our country\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nwhere corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nwhere it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nAnd hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nare subjected to this every year.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nThe locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nWe're not talking about Connecticut.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThe creator of the universe himself\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nhas told us not to spare the rod,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nlest we spoil the child --\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthis is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut we can ask the obvious question:\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nIs it a good idea, generally speaking,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nto subject children to pain\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand violence and public humiliation\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nas a way of encouraging healthy emotional development\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand good behavior?\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nIs there any doubt\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nthat this question has an answer,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nand that it matters?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nNow, many of you might worry\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat the notion of well-being is truly undefined,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nAnd so, how therefore can there be an\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nobjective notion of well-being?\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nWell, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThe concept of physical health is undefined.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAs we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nWhen this statue was carved\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nthe average life expectancy was probably 30.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nIt's now around 80 in the developed world.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThere may come a time when we meddle with our genomes\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nin such a way that not being able to run a marathon\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nat age 200 will be considered a profound disability.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nPeople will send you donations when you're in that condition.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nNotice that the fact that the concept of health\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nis open, genuinely open for revision,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\ndoes not make it vacuous.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nThe distinction between a healthy person\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand a dead one\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nis about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nAnother thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nThere may be equivalent ways to thrive;\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nthere may be equivalent ways to organize a human society\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nso as to maximize human flourishing.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nNow, why wouldn't this\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nundermine an objective morality?\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nWell think of how we talk about food:\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nI would never be tempted to argue to you\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthat there must be one right food to eat.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThere is clearly a range of materials\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nthat constitute healthy food.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nBut there's nevertheless a clear distinction\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nbetween food and poison.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThe fact that there are many right answers\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto the question, \"What is food?\"\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\ndoes not tempt us\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nto say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nMany people worry\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nthat a universal morality would require\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nmoral precepts that admit of no exceptions.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nit must always be wrong to lie,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand if you can find an exception,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nwell then there's no such thing as moral truth.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nWhy would we think this?\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nConsider, by analogy, the game of chess.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nNow, if you're going to play good chess,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\na principle like, \"Don't lose your Queen,\"\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nis very good to follow.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nBut it clearly admits some exceptions.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThere are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nThere are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThe fact that there are exceptions here does not\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nchange that at all.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nNow, this brings us to the sorts of moves\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat people are apt to make in the moral sphere.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nConsider the great problem of women's bodies:\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nWhat to do about them?\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nWell this is one thing you can do about them:\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nYou can cover them up.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nNow, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat while we may not like this,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nwe might think of this as \"wrong\"\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nin Boston or Palo Alto,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwho are we to say\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthat the proud denizens of an ancient culture\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nare wrong to force their wives and daughters\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nto live in cloth bags?\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd who are we to say, even, that they're wrong\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nto beat them with lengths of steel cable,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nor throw battery acid in

00:11:02.958\nWho are we to pretend\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthat we know so little about human well-being\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwomen should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nBut what does voluntary mean\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nin a community where,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nwhen a girl gets

detonate in your brain for a minute:\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nYour daughter gets raped,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand what you want to do is kill her.\n\n00:11:48.958 -->

the\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nperfect solution in our own society.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nFor instance,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nthis is what it's like to go to a newsstand

00:12:23.958\nwe can ask,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\n\"Is this the perfect expression\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nof psychological balance\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwith respect

OK, so perhaps there's some place\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\non the spectrum\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nbetween these two extremes\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nthat represents a place of better balance.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:53.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nPerhaps there are many such places --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nagain, given other changes in human culture\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nthere may be many peaks on the moral landscape.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nBut the thing to notice is that there will be\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nmany more ways not to be on a peak.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nNow the irony, from my perspective,\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nis that the only people who seem to generally agree with me\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nare religious demagogues of one form or another.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nAnd of course they think they have right answers to moral questions\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nbecause they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nnot because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand condition of human and animal well-being.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nIn fact, the endurance of religion\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nas a lens through which most people view moral questions\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nhas separated most moral talk\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nfrom real questions of human and animal suffering.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nThis is why we spend our time\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\ntalking about things like gay marriage\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nand not about genocide or nuclear proliferation\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nor poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut the demagogues are right about one thing: We need\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\na universal conception of human values.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nNow, what stands in the way of this?\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nWell, one thing to notice is that we\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\ndo something different when talking about morality --\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nespecially secular, academic, scientist types.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nWhen talking about morality we value differences of opinion\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nin a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nSo, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nmeditating on compassion,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nof human happiness.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nOn the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nTed Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand torturing and killing young women.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nSo, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nabout how to profitably use one's time.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nMost Western intellectuals\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nlook at this situation\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand say, \"Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nto be really right about -- really right about --\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nor for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nthat admits of a real argument\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nthat potentially falls within the purview of science.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nHe likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nThere's nothing that one should be able to say to the other\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthat should persuade the other.\"\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nNotice that we don't do this in science.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nOn the left you have Edward Witten.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nHe's a string theorist.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nIf you ask the smartest physicists around\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nwho is the smartest physicist around,\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nThe other half will tell you they don't like the question.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nSo, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand said,\"String theory is bogus.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nIt doesn't resonate with me.

00:20:52.958\nthat we are on the path toward understanding our minds\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.958\nat the level of the brain in some important detail,\n\n00:20:55.958 --> 00:20:57.958\nthen you have to admit\n\n00:20:57.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nthat we are going to understand all of the positive\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:03.958\nand negative qualities\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:05.958\nof ourselves in much greater detail.\n\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nSo, we're going to understand positive social emotion\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:09.958\nlike empathy and compassion,\n\n00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.958\nand we're going to understand the factors\n\n00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.958\nthat encourage it -- whether they're genetic,\n\n00:21:13.958 --> 00:21:15.958\nwhether they're how people talk to one another,\n\n00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:17.958\nwhether they're economic systems,\n\n00:21:17.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nand insofar as we begin to shine light on that\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.958\nwe are inevitably going to converge\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.958\non that fact space.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nSo, everything is not going to be up for grabs.\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:29.958\nIt's not going to be like\n\n00:21:29.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nveiling my daughter from birth\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nis just as good as teaching her\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:38.958\nto be confident and well-educated\n\n00:21:38.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nin the context of men who do desire women.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nI mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nthat compulsory veiling is a bad idea --\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nbut at a certain point\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:53.958\nwe're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved\n\n00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nand actually interrogate them.\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nDo people love their daughters\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:02.958\njust as much in these systems?\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nAnd I think there are clearly right answers to that.\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nCA: And if the results come out that actually they do,\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:10.958\nare you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment\n\n00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:12.958\non some of these issues?\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:15.958\nSH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,\n\n00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nthat you can love someone\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nin the context of a truly delusional belief system.\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nSo, you can say like, \"Because I knew my gay son\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:25.958\nwas going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.958\nI chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.\"\n\n00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:30.958\nIf you get all those parts aligned,\n\n00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:33.958\nyes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.\n\n00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nBut again, then we have to talk about\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nwell-being in a larger context.\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nIt's all of us in this together,\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:43.958\nnot one man feeling ecstasy\n\n00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nand then blowing himself up on a bus.\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.958\nCA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to\n\n00:22:47.958 --> 00:22:49.958\ncontinue for hours.\n\n00:22:49.958 --> 00:22:51.958\nWe don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.\n\n00:22:51.958 --> 00:22:53.958\nSH: Really an honor. Thank you.\n\n00:22:53.958 --> 00:22:56.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The fight to end rare-animal trafficking in Brazil", "duration": "334", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/juliana_machado_ferreira", "transcript": "Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna, especially birds, and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month, and transported far from their origins, to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year, a business worth almost two billion dollars. The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals, intended to supply the pet market, or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses, and this is how we end up, every month, with thousands of seized animals.And for us to understand what happens with them, we're going to follow Brad. In the eyes of many people, after the animals are seized, they say, \"Yay, justice has been served. The good guys arrived, took the cute, mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers, and everyone lived happily ever after.\" But did they? Actually, no, and this is where many of our problems begin. Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals.In Brazil, they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities, in which most of the cases, the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers. In 2002, these centers received 45,000 animals, of which 37,000 were birds. And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what's being trafficked. Some lucky ones \u2014 and among them, Brad \u2014 go to serious rehabilitation centers after that. And in these places they are cared for. They train their flying, they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature, and they are able to socialize with others from the same species. (Laughter)But then what? The Brazil Ornithological Society \u2014 so now we're talking only birds \u2014 claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature. Therefore, it would be too risky to release these animals, both for the released and for the natural populations. They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation. Following this argument, they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized. However, this would mean having killed 26,267 birds, only in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, only in 2006.But, some researchers, myself included \u2014 some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government \u2014 believe there is an alternative. We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health, behavior, inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations, then technically responsible releases are possible, both for the well-being of the individual, and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems, because we will be returning genes for these populations \u2014 which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges \u2014 and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.All of these were released by us. On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom. (Laughter) On the middle, this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release. And on the bottom, my personal favorite, the little male over there, four hours after his release he was together with a wild female. So, this is not new, people have been doing this around the world. But it's still a big issue in Brazil. We believe we have performed responsible releases. We've registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks. So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations.However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge. So, I say, \"Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue, let's do whatever we can.\" I'm devoting my career to that. And I'm here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach: Talk to your neighbor, teach your children, make sure your pet is from a legal breeder. We need to act, and act now, before these ones are the only ones left. Thank you very much.

have public leaders, public officials who are out of control; they are writing bills that are unintelligible, and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity, which has a dramatically negative impact on our life. If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits; if you're trying to get a small business loan, you face a blizzard of paperwork.What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity, transparency and empathy, building humanity into communications. I've been simplifying things for 30 years. I come out of the advertising and design business. My focus is understanding you people, and how you interact with the government to get your benefits, how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with, and how you view brands.So, very quickly, when President Obama said, \"I don't see why we can't have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement.\" So, I locked myself in a room, figured out the content, organized the document, and wrote it in plain English. I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country. This is a real thing. Now, I went one step further and said, \"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document? Let's go online.\"And many people might need help in computation. Working with the Harvard Business School, you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment: If you spent 62 dollars for a meal, the longer you take to pay out that loan, you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment it's 99 dollars and 17 cents. How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people? But it's going to work. It's more effective than just computational aids. And what about terms like \"over the limit\"? Perhaps a stealth thing. Define it in context. Tell people what it means.When you put it in plain English, you almost force the institution to give the people a way, a default out of that, and not put themselves at risk. Plain English is about changing the content. And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM. It's a grid, it's a calendar. At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities, you have responsibilities. Received very favorably by business.And there is some good news to report today. Each year, one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS. There are 200 million letters that go out. Running through this typical letter that they had, I ran it through my simplicity lab, it's pretty unintelligible. All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible. We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English. They have been tested in the laboratory. When I run it through my lab, this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible. And the IRS has introduced the program.(Applause)There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention. There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency, how to mandate simplicity. We see all this complexity. It's incumbent upon us, and this organization, I believe, to make clarity, transparency and empathy a national priority. There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate. There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.So, how are we going to change the world? Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.

That's 300 million years per minute. Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained of planet Mars. This is fly-by, Mariner IV. It was taken in 1965. When this picture appeared, that well-known scientific journal, The New York Times, wrote in its editorial, \"Mars is uninteresting. It's a dead world. NASA should not spend any time or effort studying Mars anymore.\" Fortunately, our leaders in Washington at NASA headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet.One of the key questions in all of science, \"Is there life outside of Earth?\" I believe that Mars is the most likely target for life outside the Earth. I'm going to show you in a few minutes some amazing measurements that suggest there may be life on Mars. But let me start with a Viking photograph. This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976. Viking was developed and managed at the NASA Langley Research Center. We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976. We had four spacecraft, two around Mars, two on the surface \u2014 an amazing accomplishment.This is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet. This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars. And yes, the red planet is red. Mars is half the size of the Earth, but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water, the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth. So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size. We have obtained topographic measurements of the surface of Mars. We understand the elevation differences.We know a lot about Mars. Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. Mars has the Grand Canyon of the solar system, Valles Marineris. Very, very interesting planet. Mars has the largest impact crater in the solar system, Hellas Basin. This is 2,000 miles across. If you happened to be on Mars when this impactor hit, it was a really bad day on Mars. (Laughter) This is Olympus Mons. This is bigger than the state of Arizona.Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans. We're looking at Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the solar system, superimposed on a map of the United States, 3,000 miles across. One of the most intriguing features about Mars, the National Academy of Science says one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age, is why certain areas of Mars are so highly magnetized. We call this crustal magnetism. There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason \u2014 we don't understand why at this point \u2014 the surface is very, very highly magnetized.Is there water on Mars? The answer is no, there is no liquid water on the surface of Mars today. But there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of Mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water. Today Mars is very very dry. We believe there's some water in the polar caps, there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole. Here are some recent images. This is from Spirit and Opportunity. These images that show at one time, there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars. Why is water important? Water is important because if you want life you have to have water. Water is the key ingredient in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.Here is some picture of Antarctica and a picture of Olympus Mons, very similar features, glaciers. So, this is frozen water. This is ice water on Mars. This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago. It has not been seen publicly. This is European space agency Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars and in the middle of the crater we have liquid water, we have ice. Very intriguing photograph.We now believe that in the early history of Mars, which is 4.6 billion years ago, 4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like. Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes, but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans. We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere, and this area in blue, which shows a depression of about four miles, was the ancient ocean area on the surface of Mars. Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go? Well, we have an idea. This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey. Sub-surface water on Mars, frozen in the form of ice. And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color, it means 16 percent by weight. Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior contains frozen water, or ice. So, there is a lot of water below the surface.The most intriguing and puzzling measurement, in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars, was released earlier this year in the magazine Science. And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane, CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars. And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane. Why is methane important? Because on Earth, almost all \u2014 99.9 percent \u2014 of the methane is produced by living systems, not little green men, but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface. We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars, a gas that, on Earth, is biogenic in origin, produced by living systems. These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.And this is the terrain it appears over, and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars. In fact, the Earth and Mars are both 4.6 billion years old. The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion. The reason there is a billion-year gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics, The crust of the Earth has been recycled. We have no geological record prior for the first billion years. That record exists on Mars. And this terrain that we're looking at dates back to 4.6 billion years when Earth and Mars were formed. It was a Tuesday. (Laughter)This is a map that shows where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars. Here is Viking I, Viking II. This is Opportunity. This is Spirit. This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix, we just put two years ago. Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers have gone to the northern hemisphere. That's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin. There aren't many craters. And that's because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites. But look in the southern hemisphere. In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters, there are volcanic craters. Here's Hellas Basin, a very very different place, geologically. Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very rough terrain area.What is the best way to unravel the mysteries on Mars that exist? We asked this question 10 years ago. We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists to the Langley Research Center for two days. We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered. And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question. And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES. It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor. There's a model of ARES here. This is a 20-percent scale model.This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center. If any place in the world can build an airplane to fly on Mars, it's the Langley Research Center, for almost 100 years a leading center of aeronautics in the world. We fly about a mile above the surface. We cover hundreds of miles, and we fly about 450 miles an hour. We can do things that rovers can't do and landers can't do: We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters; we fly over valleys; we can fly over surface magnetism, the polar caps, subsurface water; and we can search for life on Mars.But, of equal importance, as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars, we transmit that journey, the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth, we transmit those images back to Earth. And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars. But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians. And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality, to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars. We preprogram it. We will fly where the methane is. We will have instruments aboard the plane that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars. We will look for methane as well as other gasses produced by living systems. We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from, because we can measure the gradient where it comes from, and there, we can direct the next mission to land right in that area.How do we transport an airplane to Mars? In two words, very carefully. The problem is we don't fly it to Mars, we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars. The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet; ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long. How do we get it to Mars? We fold it, and we transport it in a spacecraft. And we have it in something called an aeroshell. This is how we do it. And we have a little video that describes the sequence.Video: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one. Main engine start, and liftoff.Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This is the spacecraft taking nine months to get to Mars. It enters the atmosphere of Mars. A lot of heating, frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour. A parachute opens up to slow it down. The thermal tiles fall off. The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time. It unfolds. The rocket engine begins.We believe that in a one-hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on Mars by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere, looking for gases of biogenic origin, looking for gases of volcanic origin, studying the surface, studying the magnetism on the surface, which we don't understand, as well as about a dozen other areas.Practice makes perfect. How do we know we can do it? Because we have tested ARES model, several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years, under Mars conditions. And, of equal importance is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere, at 100,000 feet, which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly. Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles, you fly 37,000 feet. We do our tests at 100,000 feet.And I want to show you one of our tests. This is a half-scale model. This is a high-altitude helium balloon. This is over Tilamook, Oregon. We put the folded airplane on the balloon \u2014 it took about three hours to get up there \u2014 and then we released it on command at 103,000 feet, and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly. And we've done high-altitude and low-altitude tests, just to perfect this technique.We're ready to go. I have a scale model here. But we have a full-scale model in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center. We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters (Laughter) to cover the costs. I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk for this mission. There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing. This is the ARES team; we have about 150 scientists, engineers; where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this.It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center. And let me conclude by saying not too far from here, right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina, a little more than 100 years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth. We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere. We are prepared to fly this on Mars, rewrite the textbook about Mars.

We understand\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nthe elevation differences.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nWe know a lot about Mars.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nMars has the largest volcano in the solar system,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nOlympus Mons.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nMars has the Grand Canyon\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nof the solar system, Valles Marineris.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nVery, very interesting planet.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nMars has the largest\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nimpact crater in the solar system,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nHellas Basin.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThis is 2,000 miles across.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nIf you happened to be on Mars\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nwhen this impactor hit,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nit was a really bad day on Mars.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nThis is Olympus Mons.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nThis is bigger than the state of Arizona.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nVolcanoes are important, because volcanoes\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nproduce atmospheres and they produce oceans.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nWe're looking at Valles Marineris,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nthe largest canyon in the solar system,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nsuperimposed on a map of the United States,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\n3,000 miles across.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nOne of the most intriguing features about Mars,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthe National Academy of Science says\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\none of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nis why certain areas of Mars\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nare so highly magnetized.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nWe call this crustal magnetism.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThere are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwe don't understand why at this point --\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthe surface is very, very highly magnetized.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nIs there water on Mars?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nThe answer is no, there is no liquid water\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\non the surface of Mars today.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nBut there is intriguing evidence\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nthat suggests that the early history of Mars\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nthere may have been rivers\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand fast flowing water.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nToday Mars is very very dry.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe believe there's some water in the polar caps,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthere are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nHere are some recent images.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nThis is from Spirit and Opportunity.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThese images that show at one time,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nthere was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nWhy is water important? Water is important\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nbecause if you want life you have to have water.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nWater is the key ingredient\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nin the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nHere is some picture of Antarctica\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand a picture of Olympus Mons,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nvery similar features, glaciers.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo, this is frozen water.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nThis is ice water on Mars.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nIt has not been seen publicly.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThis is European space agency\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nMars Express, image of a crater on Mars\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand in the middle of the crater\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nwe have liquid water, we have ice.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nVery intriguing photograph.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nWe now believe that in the early history of Mars,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nwhich is 4.6 billion years ago,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nMars had rivers, Mars had lakes,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nbut more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nWe believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nand this area in blue,\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwhich shows a depression of about four miles,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nwas the ancient ocean area\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\non the surface of Mars.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nWhere did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nWell, we have an idea.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThis is a measurement we obtained a few years ago\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nfrom a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSub-surface water on Mars,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfrozen in the form of ice.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nit means 16 percent by weight.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSixteen percent, by weight, of the interior\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\ncontains frozen water, or ice.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nSo, there is a lot of water below the surface.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThe most intriguing and puzzling measurement,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nin my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nwas released earlier this year\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nin the magazine Science.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nCH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nWhy is methane important?\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nBecause on Earth, almost all --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\n99.9 percent -- of the methane\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nis produced by living systems,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nnot little green men, but microscopic life\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nbelow the surface or at the surface.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWe now have evidence\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nthat methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\na gas that, on Earth,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nis biogenic in origin,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nproduced by living systems.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThese are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nAnd this is the terrain it appears over,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand we know from geological studies\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthat these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIn fact, the Earth and Mars\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nare both 4.6 billion years old.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThe oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThe reason there is a billion-year gap\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nin our geological understanding\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nis because of plate tectonics,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThe crust of the Earth has been recycled.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe have no geological record prior\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nfor the first billion years.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThat record exists on Mars.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd this terrain that we're looking at\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\ndates back to 4.6 billion years\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nwhen Earth and Mars were formed.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nIt was a Tuesday.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nThis is a map that shows\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwhere we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nHere is Viking I, Viking II.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThis is Opportunity. This is Spirit.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThis is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nwe just put two years ago.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nNotice all of our rovers and all of our landers\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nhave gone to the northern hemisphere.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nThat's because the northern hemisphere\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nis the region of the ancient\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nocean basin.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThere aren't many craters.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd that's because the water protected the basin\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nfrom being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nBut look in the southern hemisphere.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nIn the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nthere are volcanic craters.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nHere's Hellas Basin,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\na very very different place, geologically.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nLook where the methane is, the methane is in a very\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nrough terrain area.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nWhat is the best way to unravel\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nthe mysteries on Mars that exist?\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWe asked this question 10 years ago.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nWe invited 10 of the top Mars scientists\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nto the Langley Research Center for two days.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nWe addressed on the board\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthe major questions that have not been answered.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd we spent two days deciding\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nhow to best answer this question.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd the result of our meeting\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwas a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nIt's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThere's a model of ARES here.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThis is a 20-percent scale model.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThis airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIf any place in the world\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\ncan build an airplane to fly on Mars,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nit's the Langley Research Center,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nfor almost 100 years\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\na leading center of aeronautics in the world.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nWe fly about a mile above the surface.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nWe cover hundreds of miles,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand we fly about 450 miles an hour.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nWe can do things that rovers can't do\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand landers can't do:\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nWe can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwe fly over valleys;\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nwe can fly over surface magnetism,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nthe polar caps, subsurface water;\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nand we can search for life on Mars.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nBut, of equal importance,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nas we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nwe transmit that journey,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nthe first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nwe transmit those images back to Earth.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nAnd our goal is to inspire the American public\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nwho is paying for this mission through tax dollars.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBut more important we will\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\ninspire the next generation of scientists,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\ntechnologists, engineers and mathematicians.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nAnd that's a critical area of national security\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand economic vitality, to make sure\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nwe produce the next generation\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nof scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThis is what ARES looks like\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nas it flies over Mars.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nWe preprogram it.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWe will fly where the methane is.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nWe will have instruments aboard the plane\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nthat will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nWe will look for methane\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nas well as other gasses\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nproduced by living systems.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nWe will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nbecause we can measure the gradient where it comes from,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nand there, we can direct the next mission\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nto land right in that area.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nHow do we transport an airplane to Mars?\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nIn two words, very carefully.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThe problem is we don't fly it to Mars,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwe put it in a spacecraft\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nand we send it to Mars.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nThe problem is the spacecraft's\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nlargest diameter is nine feet;\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nHow do we get it to Mars?\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nWe fold it,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand we transport it in a spacecraft.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd we have it in something called an aeroshell.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThis is how we do it.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd we have a little video that describes the sequence.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nVideo: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nMain engine start, and liftoff.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nJoel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nThis is the spacecraft taking nine months\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nto get to Mars.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIt enters the atmosphere of Mars.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nA lot of heating,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nfrictional heating.

And the source was a man, an African-American man, charming, rugged, homeless, playing a violin that only had two strings.And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia. Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown, and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men, but how music helped shape that bond, and ultimately was instrumental \u2014 if you'll pardon the pun \u2014 in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.I met Mr. Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies, and came backstage and introduced himself. He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series, all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony. And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs, and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life. But as a result now, he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes, the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days, wandering the streets of Skid Row, exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him.And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014 he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes, he was lost. And he was talking about invisible demons and smoke, and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.And I was afraid, not for myself, but I was afraid that I was going to lose him, that he was going to sink into one of his states, and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy. (Laughter) So, I just started playing. And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.And as I played, I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel's eyes. It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical, a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music was its catalyst. And Nathaniel's manic rage was transformed into understanding, a quiet curiosity and grace. And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin and he started playing, by ear, certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete \u2014 Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius. And we started talking about music, from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms, Bruckner, all the B's, from Bart\u00f3k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.And I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but he related to this music at a personal level. He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic. And through playing music and talking about music, this man had transformed from the paranoid, disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming, erudite, brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.Music is medicine. Music changes us. And for Nathaniel, music is sanity. Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity, into reality. And that is an escape from his tormented state. And I understood that this was the very essence of art. This was the very reason why we made music, that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core, our emotions, and through our artistic lens, through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality. And the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us, inspires and unites us.And for Nathaniel, music brought him back into a fold of friends. The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him. And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. (Applause)Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks. Robert Gupta. (Applause)Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists. So, please forgive me.(Laughter) (Music) (Applause)", "id": 805, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nOne day, Los Angeles Times

00:01:52.958\nsaying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nNow, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nbecause when he was treated it was with shock therapy\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nand Thorazine and handcuffs,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nand that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut as a result now, he is prone to\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthese schizophrenic episodes,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nthe worst of which can manifest themselves as\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhim exploding\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand then disappearing for days,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwandering the streets of Skid Row,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nexposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nunleashed upon him.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAnd Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nwhen we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nhe had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nhe was lost.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nAnd he was talking about\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\ninvisible demons and smoke,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd I was afraid,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nnot for myself, but I was afraid\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nthat I was going to lose him,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nthat he was going to sink into one of his states,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nand that I would ruin his relationship with the violin\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nif I started talking about scales\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nand arpeggios and other exciting forms of\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\ndidactic violin pedagogy.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nSo, I just started playing.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd as I played,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nI understood that there was a profound change\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\noccurring in Nathaniel's eyes.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nIt was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\na chemical reaction, for which my playing the music\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwas its catalyst.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd Nathaniel's manic rage\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nwas transformed into understanding,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\na quiet curiosity and grace.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd in a miracle, he lifted his own violin\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand he started playing, by ear,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ncertain snippets of violin concertos\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwhich he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nTchaikovsky, Sibelius.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nAnd we started talking about music, from Bach\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nto Beethoven and Brahms,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nBruckner, all the B's,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nfrom Bart\u00f3k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nAnd I understood that he not only\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nhad an encyclopedic knowledge of music,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nbut he related to this music at a personal level.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nHe spoke about it with the kind of passion\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand understanding that I share with my colleagues\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nin the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd through playing music and talking about music,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nthis man had transformed\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nfrom the paranoid, disturbed man\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nthat had just come from walking the streets\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nof downtown Los Angeles\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nto the charming, erudite,\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nbrilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nMusic is medicine. Music changes us.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAnd for Nathaniel, music is sanity.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nBecause music allows him to take his thoughts\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nand delusions and shape them\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthrough his imagination and his creativity,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ninto reality.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAnd that is an escape\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfrom his tormented state.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd I understood that this was the very essence of art.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis was the very reason why we made music,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthat we take something that exists within all of us\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nat our very fundamental core,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nour emotions,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand through our artistic lens,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nthrough our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nAnd the reality of that expression\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nreaches all of us\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nand moves us, inspires and unites us.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd for Nathaniel,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nmusic brought him back into a fold of friends.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThe redemptive power of music brought him back\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\ninto a family of musicians\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nthat understood him,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat recognized his talents\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nand respected him.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I will always make music with Nathaniel,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nwhether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nor on Skid Row, because he reminds me\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwhy I became a musician.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nThank you.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nBruno Giussani: Thank you.

It was the early '90s, and I was at a public event. I saw this leaflet and it said, \"There are millions of slaves in the world today.\" And I thought, \"No way, no way.\" And I'm going to admit to hubris. Because I also, I'm going to admit to you, I also thought, \"How can I be like a hot-shot young full professor who teaches human rights and not know this? So it can't be true.\"Well, if you teach, if you worship in the temple of learning, do not mock the gods, because they will take you, fill you with curiosity and desire, and drive you. Drive you with a passion to change things. I went out and did a lit review, 3,000 articles on the key word \"slavery.\" Two turned out to be about contemporary \u2014 only two. All the rest were historical. They were press pieces and they were full of outrage, they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal \u2014 no solid information.So, I began to do a research project of my own. I went to five countries around the world. I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders, and I looked very deeply into slave-based businesses because this is an economic crime. People do not enslave people to be mean to them. They do it to make a profit. And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world in four different continents, was depressingly familiar. Like this: Agricultural workers in Africa, whipped and beaten, showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew. It was mind-blowing.And I want to be very clear. I'm talking about real slavery. This is not about lousy marriages, this is not about jobs that suck. This is about people who can not walk away, people who are forced to work without pay, people who are operating 24/7 under a threat of violence and have no pay. It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history.Now, where is it? Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors are the places with the highest densities of slavery. But in fact that kind of bluey color are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery. And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland where we can't find any cases of enslavement around the world.We're also particularly interested and looking very carefully at places where slaves are being used to perpetrate extreme environmental destruction. Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment, cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying forest areas in West Africa; mining and spreading mercury around in places like Ghana and the Congo; destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia. It's a pretty harrowing linkage between what's happening to our environment and what's happening to our human rights.Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this, where we have 27 million people in slavery in the year 2010? That's double the number that came out of Africa in the entire transatlantic slave trade. Well, it builds up with these factors. They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors. One we all know about, the population explosion: the world goes from two billion people to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years. Being numerous does not make you a slave. Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people in the developing world, caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts, kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once, like Sierra Leone a few years ago, and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact, as we know, live on the edge, live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute. But that doesn't make you a slave either. What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law. If the rule of law is sound, it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable. But if corruption creeps in and people don't have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law, then if you can use violence, if you can use violence with impunity, you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable into slavery.Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world. Though, for a lot of people, the people who step into slavery today don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head. They come into slavery because someone has asked them this question.All around the world I've been told an almost identical story. People say, \"I was home, someone came into our village, they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs, who needs a job?'\" And they did exactly what you or I would do in the same situation. They said, \"That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious, but my children were hungry. We needed medicine. I knew I had to do anything I could to earn some money to support the people I care about.\" They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them. Ten miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later, they find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work. They take it for a little while, but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down, and they discover they're enslaved.Now, that kind of slavery is, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history. But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable and novel about slavery today, and that is a complete collapse in the price of human beings \u2014 expensive in the past, dirt cheap now. Even the business programs have started picking up on this. I just want to share a little clip for you.Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always, as we get macro and talk commodities. Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue, head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management. And we're also joined by Brent Lawson from Lawson Frisk Securities.Brent Lawson: Happy to be here.D: Good to have you with us, Brent. Now, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently and casting our net just a little bit wider. We really like the human being story a lot. If you look at a long-term chart, prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong. So, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage as an asset is the endless supply. We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing. That is that private equity has been sniffing around, and that tells me that this market is about to explode. Africans and Indians, as usual, South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular are on our buy list.D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?MO: We're recommending to our clients a buy and hold strategy. There's no need to play the market. There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof. Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it. MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof, and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun. Here's the reality. The price of human beings across the last 4,000 years in today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars. Capital purchase items. You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.The average price of a human being today, around the world, is about 90 dollars. They are more expensive in places like North America. Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America, but I could take you places in India or Nepal where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars. They key here is that people have ceased to be that capital purchase item and become like Styrofoam cups. You buy them cheaply, you use them, you crumple them up, and then when you're done with them you just throw them away.These young boys are in Nepal. They are basically the transport system on a quarry run by a slaveholder. There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone on their backs, often of their own weight, up and down the Himalaya Mountains. One of their mothers said to us, \"You know, we can't survive here, but we can't even seem to die either.\" It's a horrible situation. And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this, it's that there are also \u2014 in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved \u2014 there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others. Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.I don't know if you've ever had a daydream about, \"Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman? What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?\" I've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job is that I get to, and I want to introduce you to one of those. His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana enslaved in the fishing industry, and he now, after escape and building a new life, has formed an organization that we work closely with to go back and get people out of slavery. This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle in the head. And this reminds me of my childhood when I used to work here.KB: James and our country director in Ghana, Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats because the two of them managed to get convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers for the very first time in Ghana for enslaving people, from the fishing industry, for enslaving children.Now, everything I've been telling you, I admit, is pretty disheartening. But there is actually a very positive side to this, and that is this: The 27 million people who are in slavery today, that's a lot of people, but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery. And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor.Slavery, illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society. And in a way, without us even noticing, has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction, waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it. And it can be done.Now, if we do that, if we put the resources and the focus to it, what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery? Well, first, before I even tell you the cost I've got to be absolutely clear. We do not buy people out of slavery. Buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back; it's abetting a crime. Liberation, however, costs some money.Liberation, and more importantly all the work that comes after liberation. It's not an event, it's a process. It's about helping people to build lives of dignity, stability, economic autonomy, citizenship. Well, amazingly, in places like India where costs are very low, that family, that three-generation family that you see there who were in hereditary slavery \u2014 so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery \u2014 but the total cost, amortized across the rest of the work, was about 150 dollars to bring that family out of slavery and then take them through a two year process to build a stable life of citizenship and education.A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars. In the United States, North America, much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ... we understand that it's expensive here: about 30,000 dollars. But most of the people in the world in slavery live in those places where the costs are lowest. And in fact, the global average is about what it is for Ghana.And that means, when you multiply it up, the estimated cost of not just freedom but sustainable freedom for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery is something like 10.8 billion dollars \u2014 what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels, what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system: usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans, or in the last holiday period when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people, we spent 10.8 billion dollars. Intel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.It's not a lot of money at the global level. In fact, it's peanuts. And the great thing about it is that it's not money down a hole, there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery to work for themselves, are they motivated? They take their kids out of the workplace, they build a school, they say, \"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares, medicine when we're sick, clothing when we're cold.\" They become consumers and producers and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.That's important, all of that about how we rebuild sustainable freedom, because we'd never want to repeat what happened in this country in 1865. Four million people were lifted up out of slavery and then dumped. Dumped without political participation, decent education, any kind of real opportunity in terms of economic lives, and then sentenced to generations of violence and prejudice and discrimination. And America is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of 1865.We have made a commitment that we will never let people come out of slavery on our watch, and end up as second class citizens. It's just not going to happen. This is what liberation really looks like. Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana, reunited with their parents, and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become slave-proof \u2014 absolutely unenslaveable.Now, this woman lived in a village in Nepal. We'd been working there about a month. They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery. They'd just begun to light up a little bit, open up a little bit. But when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph, the slaveholders were still menacing us from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back. I was frightened. We were frightened. We said to her, \"Are you worried? Are you upset?\"She said, \"No, because we've got hope now. How could we not succeed,\" she said, \"when people like you from the other side of the world are coming here to stand beside us?\"Okay, we have to ask ourselves, are we willing to live in a world with slavery? If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open to have someone else jerk the strings that tie us to slavery in the products we buy, and in our government policies. And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on, I think it's that slavery should end.And if there is a fundamental violation of our human dignity that we would all say is horrific, it's slavery. And we've got to say, what good is all of our intellectual and political and economic power \u2014 and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room \u2014 if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end? I think there is enough intellectual power in this room to bring slavery to an end. And you know what? If we can't do that, if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery, there is one last question: Are we truly free? Okay, thank you so much.

And I'm not a trained academic. Neither am I a veteran social worker. I was 26 years in the corporate world, trying to make organizations profitable. And then in 2003 I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation from my kitchen table.The first thing that we did was walk through the slums. You know, by the way, there are two million people in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums. We couldn't go to all the slums, but we tried to cover as much as we could. We walked through these slums, identified houses where children would never go to school. We talked to the parents, tried to convince them about sending their children to school. We played with the children, and came back home really tired, exhausted, but with images of bright faces, twinkling eyes, and went to sleep.We were all excited to start, but the numbers hit us then: 200 million children between four to 14 that should be going to school, but do not; 100 million children who go to school but cannot read; 125 million who cannot do basic maths. We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees was dedicated for government schooling. Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary and administrators' salary. And yet, India has nearly the highest teacher absenteeism in the world, with one out of four teachers not going to school at all the entire academic year.Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling, overwhelming, and we were constantly asked, \"When will you start? How many schools will you start? How many children will you get? How are you going to scale? How are you going to replicate?\" It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted. But we dug our heels and said, \"We're not in the number game. We want to take one child at a time and take the child right through school, sent to college, and get them prepared for better living, a high value job.\"So, we started Parikrma. The first Parikrma school started in a slum where there were 70,000 people living below the poverty line. Our first school was on a rooftop of a building inside the slums, a second story building, the only second story building inside the slums. And that rooftop did not have any ceiling, only half a tin sheet. That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children. Indian academic year begins in June. So, June it rains, so many a times all of us would be huddled under the tin roof, waiting for the rain to stop. My God! What a bonding exercise that was. And all of us that were under that roof are still here together today. Then came the second school, the third school, the fourth school and a junior college. In six years now, we have four schools, one junior college, 1,100 children coming from 28 slums and four orphanages. (Applause)Our dream is very simple: to send each of these kids, get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully, contented in this conflict-ridden chaotic globalized world. Now, when you talk global you have to talk English. And so all our schools are English medium schools. But they know there is this myth that children from the slums cannot speak English well. No one in their family has spoken English. No one in their generation has spoken English. But how wrong it is.Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear] and Hardy Boys. Although they are like in different contexts, one is magical, the other two are like investigation, I like those books because they have something special in them. The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing. I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book. Even if it takes me four and a half hours, or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.Boy: I did good research and I got the information [on the] world's fastest cars. I like Ducati ZZ143, because it is the fastest, the world's fastest bike, and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI because it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw, her father sells flowers on the roadside. And this little boy has been coming to school for five years. But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world love fast bikes? (Laughter) He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course, but he has done a lot of research through Google search. You know, when we started with our English medium schools we also decided to adopt the best curriculum possible, the ICSE curriculum. And again, there were people who laughed at me and said, \"Don't be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students. They'll never be able to cope.\" Not only do our children cope very well, but they excel in it. You should just come across to see how well our children do.There is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school; they'd much rather put them to work. That's absolute hogwash. All parents all over the world want their children to lead a better life than themselves, but they need to believe that change is possible.Video: (Hindi)SB: We have 80 percent attendance for all our parents-teachers meeting. Sometimes it's even 100 percent, much more than many privileged schools. Fathers have started to attend. It's very interesting. When we started our school the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register. Now they have started writing their signature. The children have taught them. It's amazing how much children can teach.We have, a few months ago, actually late last year, we had a few mothers who came to us and said, \"You know, we want to learn how to read and write. Can you teach us?\" So, we started an afterschool for our parents, for our mothers. We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study. We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools.Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics. So, you can imagine how traumatized and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from. We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs and when they come back, most times sober, we have to find a job for them so that they don't regress. We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook. We have taught them nutrition, hygiene. We have helped them set up the kitchen and now they are supplying food to all our children. They do a very good job because their children are eating their food, but most importantly this is the first time they have got respect, and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.More than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff are all parents and extended families. We've started many programs just to make sure that the child comes to school. Vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.There is also this myth that children from the slums cannot integrate with mainstream. Take a look at this little girl who was one of the 28 children from all privileged schools, best schools in the country that was selected for the Duke University talent identification program and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.Video: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA, it was such a pride for us to go to that camp. Everybody was very friendly, especially I got a lot of friends. And I felt that my English has improved a lot going there and chatting with friends. There they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset, a totally different society. I mingled with almost everyone. They were very friendly. I had very good friends there, who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai. Even now we are in touch through Facebook.After this Ahmedabad trip I've been like a totally different mingling with people and all of those. Before that I feel like I wasn't like this. I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly. My accent with English improved a lot. And I learned football, volleyball, Frisbee, lots of games. And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here. Such beautiful food, I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful. I enjoyed eating food like [unclear] would come and ask me, \"Yes ma'am, what you want?\" It was so good to hear!(Laughter) (Applause)SB: This girl was working as a maid before she came to school. And today she wants to be a neurologist.Our children are doing brilliantly in sports. They are really excelling. There is an inter-school athletic competition that is held every year in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate from 140 best schools in the city. We've got the best school award for three years successively. And our children are coming back home with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends. Last year there were a couple of kids from elite schools that came to ask for admissions in our school. We also have our very own dream team.Why is this happening? Why this confidence? Is it the exposure? We have professors from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Indian Institute of Science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas, experiments, much beyond the classroom. Art, music are considered therapy and mediums of expression. We also believe that it's the content that is more important. It is not the infrastructure, not the toilets, not the libraries, but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important. Creating an environment of learning, of inquiry, of exploration is what is true education.When we started Parikrma we had no idea which direction we were taking. We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan. But we know for sure that what we want to do today is take one child at a time, not get bogged with numbers, and actually see the child complete the circle of life, and unleash his total potential. We do not believe in scale because we believe in quality, and scale and numbers will automatically happen. We have corporates that have stood behind us, and we are able to, now, open more schools. But we began with the idea of one child at a time.This is five-year-old Parusharam. He was begging by a bus stop a few years ago, got picked up and is now in an orphanage, has been coming to school for the last four and a half months. He's in kindergarten. He has learned how to speak English. We have a model by which kids can speak English and understand English in three month's time. He can tell you stories in English of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile and of the giraffe. And if you ask him what he likes to do he will say, \"I like sleeping. I like eating. I like playing.\" And if you ask him what he wants to do, he will say, \"I want to horsing.\" Now, \"horsing\" is going for a horse ride. So, Parusharam comes to my office every day. He comes for a tummy rub, because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)When I started Parikrma I began with a great deal of arrogance of transforming the world. But today I have been transformed. I have been changed with my children. I've learned so much from them: love, compassion, imagination and such creativity. Parusharam is Parikrma with a simple beginning but a long way to go. I promise you, Parusharam will speak in the TED conference a few years from now. Thank you.

Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year. That's just one source.My question is: How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run? That's the idea behind The Long News. It's a project by The Long Now Foundation, which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand. And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now. And when you look at the news through that filter, a lot falls by the wayside.To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year, is this going to matter in a decade? Or this? Or this? Really? Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years? Okay, that was kind of cool. (Laughter) But the top story of this past year was the economy, and I'm just betting that, sooner or later, this particular recession is going to be old news.So, what kind of stories might make a difference for the future? Well, let's take science. Someday, little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things. That someday is already here if you're a mouse. Some recent stories: nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom; they're sending genes into the brain; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people? We're having trouble feeding six billion today. As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry. Britain will starve without genetically modified crops. Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.What about global politics? The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda, and they may. They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market, they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter, and they've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers.We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know. Some recent discoveries: There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica; there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery \u2014 soon, science may no longer need us, and life may no longer need us either; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years. It seems that with or without us, life will go on.But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one: water found on the moon. Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there. And if NASA doesn't do it, China might, or somebody in this room might write a big check.My point is this: In the long run, some news stories are more important than others.

So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish, in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it.First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. What he's doing is so easy to follow. Here's his first follower with a crucial role; he's going to show everyone else how to follow.Now, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal. Now it's not about the leader anymore; it's about them, plural. Now, there he is calling to his friends. Now, if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself. It takes guts to stand out like that. The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.(Laughter)(Applause)And here comes a second follower. Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts \u2014 three is a crowd, and a crowd is news. So a movement must be public. It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.Now, here come two more people, and immediately after, three more people. Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point. Now we've got a movement.(Laughter)So, notice that, as more people join in, it's less risky. So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to. They won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.(Laughter)So, over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in. And that's how you make a movement.But let's recap some lessons from this. So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it's clearly about the movement, not you.(Laughter)Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.The biggest lesson, if you noticed \u2014 did you catch it? \u2014 is that leadership is over-glorified. Yes, it was the shirtless guy who was first, and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader. So, as we're told that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective.If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow.

For kids like me, being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands, exhibit irresponsible behavior, or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all, take a look at these events: Imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W. Bush. Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.Now, what have kids done? Well, Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust. Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States. And, most recently, Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti, on his little bike. So as you can see evidenced by such examples, age has absolutely nothing to do with it. The traits the word \"childish\" addresses are seen so often in adults, that we should abolish this age-discriminatory word, when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking.(Applause)Thank you.Then again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs? Maybe you've had grand plans before, but stopped yourself, thinking, \"That's impossible,\" or \"That costs too much,\" or \"That won't benefit me.\" For better or worse, we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things. Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking, like my wish that no one went hungry, or that everything were free, a kind of utopia. How many of you still dream like that, and believe in the possibilities? Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals can be a burden, because you know that if everything were free, then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. On the other hand, we kids still dream about perfection. And that's a good thing, because in order to make anything a reality, you have to dream about it first.In many ways, our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, my home state \u2014 yoohoo, Washington!(Applause)has a program called Kids Design Glass, and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program, because kids don't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes, they just think of good ideas. Now, when you think of glass, you might think of colorful Chihuly designs, or maybe Italian vases, but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that, into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.(Laughter)Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now, I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd \u2014 teachers and students, and I like this analogy: It shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class, telling students, \"Do this, do that.\" The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown-ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality, unfortunately, is a little different, and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.Now, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right? If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I established on her last loan, I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me, until she pays it back.(Laughter)True story, by the way. Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids, from every \"Don't do that, don't do this\" in the school handbook, to restrictions on school Internet use. As history points out, regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes, kids have no or very little say in making the rules, when really, the attitude should be reciprocal, meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population.Now, what's even worse than restriction, is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities. We love challenges, but when expectations are low, trust me, we will sink to them. My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister. Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that, but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ-fighters, when lots of other kids were hearing \"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round.\" Well, we heard that one too, but \"Pioneer Germ Fighters\" totally rules.(Laughter)I loved to write from the age of four, and when I was six, my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma. I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop, and I wanted to get published. Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published, or saying wait until you're older, my parents were really supportive. Many publishers were not quite so encouraging. One large children's publisher ironically said that they didn't work with children. Children's publisher not working with children? I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there.(Laughter)One publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me, and to listen to what I had to say. They published my first book, \"Flying Fingers,\" you see it here. And from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools, keynoting to thousands of educators, and finally, today, speaking to you.I appreciate your attention today, because to show that you truly care, you listen. But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults. Kids grow up and become adults just like you.(Laughter)Or just like you? Really? The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult, but rather, better adults than you have been, which may be a little challenging, considering your guys' credentials.(Laughter)But the way progress happens, is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones. It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore. No matter your position or place in life, it is imperative to create opportunities for children, so that we can grow up to blow you away.(Laughter)Adults and fellow TEDsters, you need to listen and learn from kids, and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today, because we are the leaders of tomorrow, which means we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile. No, just kidding.(Laughter)No, really, we are going to be the next generation, the ones who will bring this world forward. And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you, remember that cloning is possible, and that involves going through childhood again, in which case you'll want to be heard, just like my generation. Now, the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed. Are you ready to make the match?

Thank you.", "id": 815, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:14.227\nNow, I want to start with a question:\n\n00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.664\nWhen was the last time\nyou were called \"childish\"?\n\n00:00:17.688 --> 00:00:18.934\nFor kids like me,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.314\nbeing called childish\ncan be a frequent occurrence.\n\n00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:24.934\nEvery time we make irrational demands,\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.934\nexhibit irresponsible behavior,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.934\nor display any other signs\nof being normal American citizens,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.350\nwe are called childish.\n\n00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:34.934\nWhich really bothers me.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.934\nAfter all, take a look at these events:\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.934\nImperialism and colonization,\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.934\nworld wars, George W. Bush.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.934\nAsk yourself, who's responsible? Adults.\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.934\nNow, what have kids done?\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.934\nWell, Anne Frank touched millions\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.934\nwith her powerful account\nof the Holocaust.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.934\nRuby Bridges helped to end\nsegregation in the United States.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.934\nAnd, most recently,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.651\nCharlie Simpson helped to raise\n120,000 pounds for Haiti,\n\n00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:05.500\non his little bike.\n\n00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:07.934\nSo as you can see evidenced\nby such examples,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.934\nage has absolutely nothing to do with it.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.792\nThe traits the word \"childish\" addresses\nare seen so often in adults,\n\n00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:17.560\nthat we should abolish\nthis age-discriminatory word,\n\n00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:21.330\nwhen it comes to criticizing behavior\nassociated with irresponsibility\n\n00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:22.734\nand irrational thinking.\n\n00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:28.661\n(Applause)\n\n00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:30.065\nThank you.\n\n00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:34.528\nThen again, who's to say\nthat certain types of irrational thinking\n\n00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.934\naren't exactly what the world needs?\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.266\nMaybe you've had grand plans before,\n\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.251\nbut stopped yourself, thinking,\n\n00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.575\n\"That's impossible,\"\nor \"That costs too much,\"\n\n00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.067\nor \"That won't benefit me.\"\n\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.013\nFor better or worse, we kids\naren't hampered as much\n\n00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:51.188\nwhen it comes to thinking\nabout reasons why not to do things.\n\n00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:55.456\nKids can be full of inspiring\naspirations and hopeful thinking,\n\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.440\nlike my wish that no one went hungry,\n\n00:01:57.464 --> 00:02:00.099\nor that everything were free,\na kind of utopia.\n\n00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:04.672\nHow many of you still dream like that,\nand believe in the possibilities?\n\n00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:09.790\nSometimes a knowledge of history\nand the past failures of Utopian ideals\n\n00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:10.973\ncan be a burden,\n\n00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.149\nbecause you know\nthat if everything were free,\n\n00:02:13.173 --> 00:02:17.077\nthen the food stocks would become\ndepleted and scarce and lead to chaos.\n\n00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:20.934\nOn the other hand, we kids\nstill dream about perfection.\n\n00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:24.813\nAnd that's a good thing, because\nin order to make anything a reality,\n\n00:02:24.837 --> 00:02:26.934\nyou have to dream about it first.\n\n00:02:27.883 --> 00:02:29.934\nIn many ways, our audacity to imagine\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.831\nhelps push the boundaries of possibility.\n\n00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:36.378\nFor instance, the Museum\nof Glass in Tacoma, Washington,\n\n00:02:36.402 --> 00:02:38.299\nmy home state -- yoohoo, Washington!\n\n00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:40.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.156\nhas a program called Kids Design Glass,\n\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.307\nand kids draw their own\nideas for glass art.\n\n00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.149\nThe resident artist said\nthey got some of their best ideas\n\n00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:51.196\nfrom the program, because kids\ndon't think about the limitations\n\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.855\nof how hard it can be to blow\nglass into certain shapes,\n\n00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.472\nthey just think of good ideas.\n\n00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:59.934\nNow, when you think of glass, you\nmight think of colorful Chihuly designs,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.115\nor maybe Italian vases,\n\n00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.934\nbut kids challenge glass artists\nto go beyond that,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.653\ninto the realm of brokenhearted snakes\n\n00:03:07.677 --> 00:03:10.907\nand bacon boys,\nwho you can see has meat vision.\n\n00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.526\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.185\nNow, our inherent wisdom doesn't\nhave to be insider's knowledge.\n\n00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.779\nKids already do a lot\nof learning from adults,\n\n00:03:20.803 --> 00:03:22.581\nand we have a lot to share.\n\n00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:25.887\nI think that adults should\nstart learning from kids.\n\n00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:27.315\nNow, I do most of my speaking\n\n00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.981\nin front of an education crowd --\nteachers and students,\n\n00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:31.165\nand I like this analogy:\n\n00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.680\nIt shouldn't be a teacher\nat the head of the class,\n\n00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:35.497\ntelling students, \"Do this, do that.\"\n\n00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.934\nThe students should teach their teachers.\n\n00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.900\nLearning between grown-ups\nand kids should be reciprocal.\n\n00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.934\nThe reality, unfortunately,\nis a little different,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.934\nand it has a lot to do\nwith trust, or a lack of it.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.330\nNow, if you don't trust someone,\nyou place restrictions on them, right?\n\n00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:55.276\nIf I doubt my older sister's ability\nto pay back the 10 percent interest\n\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.933\nI established on her last loan,\n\n00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:59.934\nI'm going to withhold her ability\nto get more money from me,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.332\nuntil she pays it back.\n\n00:04:01.356 --> 00:04:02.523\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:04.446\nTrue story, by the way.\n\n00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.934\nNow, adults seem to have\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.634\na prevalently restrictive\nattitude towards kids,\n\n00:04:10.658 --> 00:04:13.934\nfrom every \"Don't do that, don't do this\"\nin the school handbook,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.702\nto restrictions on school Internet use.\n\n00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:19.759\nAs history points out,\nregimes become oppressive\n\n00:04:19.783 --> 00:04:22.006\nwhen they're fearful\nabout keeping control.\n\n00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.364\nAnd although adults\nmay not be quite at the level\n\n00:04:24.388 --> 00:04:25.934\nof totalitarian regimes,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.934\nkids have no or very little say\nin making the rules,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.173\nwhen really, the attitude\nshould be reciprocal,\n\n00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:33.894\nmeaning that the adult\npopulation should learn\n\n00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:36.934\nand take into account the wishes\nof the younger population.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.934\nNow, what's even worse than restriction,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.530\nis that adults often\nunderestimate kids' abilities.\n\n00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:45.712\nWe love challenges, but when\nexpectations are low,\n\n00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:47.347\ntrust me, we will sink to them.\n\n00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:51.482\nMy own parents had anything\nbut low expectations\n\n00:04:51.506 --> 00:04:52.799\nfor me and my sister.\n\n00:04:53.442 --> 00:04:58.561\nOkay, so they didn't tell us to become\ndoctors or lawyers or anything like that,\n\n00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:04.183\nbut my dad did read to us about Aristotle\nand pioneer germ-fighters,\n\n00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:05.934\nwhen lots of other kids were hearing\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.006\n\"The Wheels on the Bus\nGo Round and Round.\"\n\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.898\nWell, we heard that one too, but\n\"Pioneer Germ Fighters\" totally rules.\n\n00:05:11.922 --> 00:05:12.935\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.933\nI loved to write from the age\nof four, and when I was six,\n\n00:05:15.957 --> 00:05:19.934\nmy mom bought me my own laptop\nequipped with Microsoft Word.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.368\nThank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.\n\n00:05:22.392 --> 00:05:25.934\nI wrote over 300 short stories\non that little laptop,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.934\nand I wanted to get published.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.934\nInstead of just scoffing at this heresy\nthat a kid wanted to get published,\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.934\nor saying wait until you're older,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.878\nmy parents were really supportive.\n\n00:05:37.521 --> 00:05:40.299\nMany publishers were not\nquite so encouraging.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.934\nOne large children's\npublisher ironically said\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.775\nthat they didn't work with children.\n\n00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.448\nChildren's publisher not\nworking with children?\n\n00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:52.631\nI don't know, you're kind\nof alienating a large client there.\n\n00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:54.337\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:54.361 --> 00:06:00.189\nOne publisher, Action Publishing, was\nwilling to take that leap and trust me,\n\n00:06:00.213 --> 00:06:01.903\nand to listen to what I had to say.\n\n00:06:01.927 --> 00:06:05.476\nThey published my first book,\n\"Flying Fingers,\" you see it here.\n\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.934\nAnd from there on, it's gone\nto speaking at hundreds of schools,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.981\nkeynoting to thousands of educators,\n\n00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:13.528\nand finally, today, speaking to you.\n\n00:06:13.552 --> 00:06:15.488\nI appreciate your attention today,\n\n00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:18.338\nbecause to show that you\ntruly care, you listen.\n\n00:06:19.577 --> 00:06:21.934\nBut there's a problem\nwith this rosy picture\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.934\nof kids being so much better than adults.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.267\nKids grow up and become\nadults just like you.\n\n00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:29.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.322\nOr just like you? Really?\n\n00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:35.814\nThe goal is not to turn kids\ninto your kind of adult,\n\n00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:37.934\nbut rather, better adults\nthan you have been,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.274\nwhich may be a little challenging,\nconsidering your guys' credentials.\n\n00:06:41.298 --> 00:06:42.456\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.934\nBut the way progress happens,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.934\nis because new generations and new eras\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.934\ngrow and develop and become\nbetter than the previous ones.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.116\nIt's the reason we're not\nin the Dark Ages anymore.\n\n00:06:53.505 --> 00:06:55.934\nNo matter your position or place in life,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.934\nit is imperative to create\nopportunities for children,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.934\nso that we can grow up to blow you away.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.844\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:06.934\nAdults and fellow TEDsters,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.934\nyou need to listen and learn from kids,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.621\nand trust us and expect more from us.\n\n00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:15.187\nYou must lend an ear today,\n\n00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:17.909\nbecause we are the leaders\nof tomorrow, which means\n\n00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:20.735\nwe're going to take care of you\nwhen you're old and senile.\n\n00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.052\nNo, just kidding.\n\n00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:23.076\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.795\nNo, really, we are going\nto be the next generation,\n\n00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.104\nthe ones who will bring\nthis world forward.\n\n00:07:28.128 --> 00:07:31.279\nAnd in case you don't think\nthat this really has meaning for you,\n\n00:07:31.303 --> 00:07:32.934\nremember that cloning is possible,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.244\nand that involves going\nthrough childhood again,\n\n00:07:35.268 --> 00:07:38.934\nin which case you'll want to be\nheard, just like my generation.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:44.934\nNow, the world needs opportunities\nfor new leaders and new ideas.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.934\nKids need opportunities\nto lead and succeed.\n\n00:07:48.254 --> 00:07:50.119\nAre you ready to make the match?\n\n00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:55.079\nBecause the world's problems\nshouldn't be the human family's heirloom.\n\n00:07:55.103 --> 00:07:56.934\nThank you.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nThank you. Thank you."}, {"title": "Sex, drugs and HIV -- let's get rational", "duration": "1154", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_pisani_sex_drugs_and_hiv_let_s_get_rational_1", "transcript": "\"People do stupid things. That's what spreads HIV.\" This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper, The Guardian, not that long ago. I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it? Well, one or two brave souls.This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who's been in field of HIV for 15 years, worked on four continents, and you're looking at her.And I am now going to argue that this is only half true. People do get HIV because they do stupid things, but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons. Now, \"rational\" is the dominant paradigm in public health, and if you put your public health nerd glasses on, you'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what's good for them and what's bad for them, if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information, and a little bit of motivation, people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives. Wonderful.That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV, and although I'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality, and if you were at TED '07 it's about coffee prices ... Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs, and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational, they are erections and addiction.(Laughter)So, let's start with what's rational for an addict. Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie. We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection. It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail, and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues. And so everyone lined up, all the smackheads in a row, and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit, and he went down and started injecting people. So he injects the first guy, and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt, and he injects the next guy. And Frankie says, \"I'm number 22 in line, and I can see the needle coming down towards me, and there is blood all over the place. It's getting blunter and blunter. And a small part of my brain is thinking, 'That is so gross and really dangerous,' but most of my brain is thinking, 'Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me. Please let there be some left.'\" And then, telling me this story, Frankie said, \"You know ... God, drugs really make you stupid.\"And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy. But, actually, Frankie, at that time, was a heroin addict and he was in jail. So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high. And if there's one place you really want to get high, it's when you're in jail.But I'm a scientist and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes, so let's look at some data. We talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia, and we said, \"Well, do you know how you get HIV?\" \"Oh yeah, by sharing needles.\" I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles. And, \"Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that?\" \"Oh yeah.\" Hundred percent. \"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles.\" \"So are you carrying a needle?\" We're actually interviewing people on the street, in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs. \"Are you carrying clean needles?\" One in four, maximum. So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10, and the other nine in 10 are sharing.So you've got this massive mismatch; everyone knows that if they share they're going to get HIV, but they're all sharing anyway. So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something? We asked that to a junkie and they're like, \"Are you nuts?\" You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with. There's just kind of an ick factor there. \"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail.\" So, in Indonesia at this time, if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up, they could put you into jail. And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it? Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now, or I could share a needle now and get a disease that's going to possibly kill me 10 years from now, or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow. And while junkies think that it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV, they think it's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway. So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles.Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view. This is a really easy problem. For once, your incentives are aligned. We've got what's rational for public health. You want people to use clean needles \u2014 and junkies want to use clean needles. So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest. Now, the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher. And she put in the world's first national needle exchange program, and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others. And in all of those countries, you can see, not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV.Now, places that didn't do this \u2014 New York City for example, Moscow, Jakarta \u2014 we're talking, at its peak, one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease. Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this because she has any great love for junkies. She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service. So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention, she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on, and obviously those are much higher. So she was making a politically rational decision. Now, if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data, it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? But in this country, where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter) we've taken a very different approach. So what we've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data \u2014 endlessly reviewing the data. So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States, and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective \u2014 quite a lot of them. Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective \u2014 you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up, but no \u2014 that's the whole slide.(Laughter)There is nothing on the other side. So, completely irrational, you would think. Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too, and they're responding to what they think the voters want. So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this.(Laughter)So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors. Now let's talk about sex. Are we any more rational about sex? Well, I'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church, who think somehow that if you give out condoms, everyone's going to run out and have sex. I don't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online, but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict \u2014 I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid. (Laughter) (Applause) It's not that easy! Here, maybe you'll have better luck.(Applause)Okay, seriously, HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually. So, it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids. And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus right at the beginning when you're first infected, then you start making antibodies, and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time \u2014 10 or 12 years \u2014 you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection. But basically, nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS, and by that stage, you're not looking great, you're not feeling great, you're not having that much sex.So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia. Now, this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups, and that's considered stigmatizing. I've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing, whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing, but we'll leave that be. The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time. And those groups are, globally, people who sell sex and their more regular partners. They are gay men on the party scene who have, on average, three times more partners than straight people on the party scene. And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy, and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa. And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.You can see these horrifying figures from Africa. These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven, and one in three of all adults, are infected with HIV. Now, in the rest of the world, we've got basically nothing going on in the general population \u2014 very, very low levels \u2014 but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk: drug injectors, sex workers and gay men. And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles: 25 percent prevalence among gay men. Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex. You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person.In most of the world, these few prevention failures notwithstanding, we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex: condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries. And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives. What's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it's really bad for business to have another STI. No one wants it. And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either. So essentially, you're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.But in \"intimate\" relations it's much more difficult because, with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things, we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy, and nothing is quite so unromantic as the, \"My condom or yours, darling?\" question. So in the face of that, you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms.This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph. He's from Haiti and he has AIDS. And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now, but he is a reminder in the population, of why you might want to be using condoms. This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps. Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment. Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect. But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making. So, what we've got \u2014 some people say, \"Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV.\" So, if you look at the viremia thing again, if you do start treatment when you're sick, well, what happens? Your viral load comes down. But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment? Well, you die, so your viral load goes to zero. And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes \u2014 which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy, or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs, or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever \u2014 all of that is virus that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.Now, am I saying, \"Oh, well, great prevention strategy. Let's just stop treating people.\" Of course not, of course not. We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can. But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need. That's simply not necessarily true, and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now. And what we've seen is that, actually, condom use rates, which were very, very high \u2014 the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV, with extremely little help from public health nerds, I would say \u2014 that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really: One is the assumption of, \"Oh well, if he's infected, he's probably on meds, and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe.\"And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS, and rightly so. AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you, and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day. And that's boring, but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex, no matter how drunk you are, no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever? If we look at the data, we can see that the answer to that question is, mmm.So these are data from Scotland. You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program. Then it came way down. And both in heterosexuals \u2014 mostly in commercial sex \u2014 and in drug users, you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins, and that's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier. But in gay men, you've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available. This is of new infections.What does that mean? It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population \u2014 more people living longer, healthier lives, more likely to be getting laid with HIV \u2014 is outweighing the effects of lower viral load, and that's a very worrisome thing. What does it mean? It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.Is that what's happening? No, and I call it the \"compassion conundrum.\" We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days, and what's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers, unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies. But once they've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone to being AIDS victims, we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. It doesn't make any sense from a public health point of view.I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines. Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta; she's a chick with a dick. Why does she do that job? Well, of course, because she's forced into it because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc. And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well. This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia: on average, 20 cents. It varies a bit province to province. I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them for this particular slide, and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour. So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice. Okay, Ines.We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash, and commitment to preventing HIV too.Ines: So why is prevalence still rising? It's all politics. When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.Elizabeth Pisani: \"When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.\" So, from the point of view of a sex worker, politicians are making no sense. From the point of view of a public health nerd, junkies are doing dumb things. The truth is that everyone has a different rationale. There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet, and that's one of the glories of human existence. But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another, so it's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician, and it's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they're responding to what they think the voters want. But here's the thing: we are the voters. We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders. And everyone who's in this room, and everyone who's watching this out there on the web, I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense. It's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there, but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 818, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.958\n\"People do stupid things.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nThat's what spreads HIV.\"\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nThis was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nThe Guardian, not that long ago.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nI'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nWell, one or two brave souls.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nThis is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nwho's been in field of HIV for 15 years,\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nworked on four continents,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nand you're looking at her.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nAnd I am now going to argue\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nthat this is only half true.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nPeople do get HIV because they do stupid things,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nbut most of them are doing stupid things\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nfor perfectly rational reasons.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nNow, \"rational\" is the dominant paradigm\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nin public health,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nand if you put your public health nerd glasses on,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nyou'll see that if we give people the information that they need\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nabout what's good for them and what's bad for them,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nif you give them the services\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nthat they can use to act on that information,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nand a little bit of motivation,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\npeople will make rational decisions\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nand live long and healthy lives.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nWonderful.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThat's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nand although I'm sure you all know\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nthat HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nand if you were at TED '07\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nit's about coffee prices ...\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nActually, HIV's about sex and drugs,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nand if there are two things that make\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nhuman beings a little bit irrational,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nthey are erections and addiction.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nSo, let's start with what's rational for an addict.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nNow, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nWe were having lunch and he was telling me\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nabout when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nIt was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nsmuggled some heroin into jail,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nand he was very generously sharing it out\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nwith all of his colleagues.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd so everyone lined up,\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nall the smackheads in a row,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand the guy whose birthday it was\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nfilled up the fit,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nand he went down and started injecting people.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nSo he injects the first guy,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nand then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand he injects the next guy.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd Frankie says, \"I'm number 22 in line,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nand I can see the needle coming down towards me,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nand there is blood all over the place.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nIt's getting blunter and blunter.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd a small part of my brain is thinking,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\n'That is so gross\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nand really dangerous,'\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nbut most of my brain is thinking,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\n'Please let there be some smack left\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nby the time it gets to me.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nPlease let there be some left.'\"\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd then, telling me this story,\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nFrankie said,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\n\"You know ...

00:04:35.958\nBecause your choice now is either\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nI use my own needle now,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nor I could share a needle now\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand get a disease that's going to\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\npossibly kill me 10 years from now,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nor I could use my own needle now\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand go to jail tomorrow.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd while junkies think that\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nit's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthey think it's a much worse idea\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nto spend the next year in jail\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nwhere they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand expose themselves to HIV anyway.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nSo, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nto share needles.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nNow, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThis is a really easy problem.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nFor once, your incentives are aligned.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWe've got what's rational for public health.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nYou want people to use clean needles --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand junkies want to use clean needles.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nSo we could make this problem go away\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nsimply by making clean needles universally available\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nand taking away the fear of arrest.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nNow, the first person to figure that out\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nand do something about it on a national scale\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nwas that well-known, bleeding heart liberal\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nMargaret Thatcher.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd she put in the world's first\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nnational needle exchange program,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd in all of those countries, you can see,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nnot more than four percent of injectors\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\never became infected with HIV.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nNow, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nMoscow, Jakarta --\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nwe're talking, at its peak,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\none in two injectors\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\ninfected with this fatal disease.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nNow, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nbecause she has any great love for junkies.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nShe did it because she ran a country\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nthat had a national health service.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nSo, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nshe was going to have pick up the costs\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nof treatment later on,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand obviously those are much higher.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nSo she was making a politically rational decision.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nNow, if I take out my\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\npublic health nerd glasses here\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nand look at these data,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nit seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nBut in this country,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwhere the government apparently does not feel compelled\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nwe've taken a very different approach.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSo what we've been doing in the United States\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nis reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nSo, these are reviews of hundreds of studies\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nby all the big muckety-mucks\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nof the scientific pantheon in the United States,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nand these are the studies that show\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nneedle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nNow, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nyou think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nand I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nbut no -- that's the whole slide.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nThere is nothing on the other side.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo, completely irrational,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nyou would think.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nExcept that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand they're responding to what they think the voters want.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nSo what we see is that voters respond\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nvery well to things like this\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand not quite so well to things like this.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nSo it becomes quite rational\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nto deny services to injectors.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nNow let's talk about sex.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAre we any more rational about sex?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nWell, I'm not even going to address\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthe clearly irrational positions\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nof people like the Catholic Church,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nwho think somehow that if you give out condoms,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\neveryone's going to run out and have sex.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI don't know if Pope Benedict\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwatches TEDTalks online,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nbut if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nI carry condoms all the time\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand I never get laid.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nIt's not that easy!\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nHere, maybe you'll have better luck.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:35.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nOkay, seriously,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nHIV is actually not that easy\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nto transmit sexually.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nSo, it depends on how much virus there is\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nin your blood and in your body fluids.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd what we've got is a very, very high level of virus\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nright at the beginning when you're first infected,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nthen you start making antibodies,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nand then it bumps along at quite low levels\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nfor a long time -- 10 or 12 years --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nyou have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nBut basically, nothing much is going on\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nuntil you start to get symptomatic AIDS,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand by that stage,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nyou're not looking great, you're not feeling great,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nyou're not having that much sex.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo the sexual transmission of HIV\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nis essentially determined by how many partners you have\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nin these very short spaces of time\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nwhen you have peak viremia.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nNow, this makes people crazy\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nbecause it means that you have to talk about\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nsome groups having more sexual partners\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nin shorter spaces of time than other groups,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nand that's considered stigmatizing.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nI've always been a bit curious about that\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbecause I think stigma is a bad thing,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nwhereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nbut we'll leave that be.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nThe truth is that 20 years\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nof very good research\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nhave shown us that\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthere are groups that are more likely to turnover\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nlarge numbers of partners in a short space of time.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd those groups are, globally,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\npeople who sell sex and their more regular partners.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nThey are gay men on the party scene\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nwho have, on average, three times more partners\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nthan straight people on the party scene.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd they are heterosexuals\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nwho come from countries that have\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\ntraditions of polygamy\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand relatively high levels of female autonomy,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nYou can see these horrifying figures from Africa.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nThese are all countries in southern Africa\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhere between one in seven,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand one in three\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nof all adults,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nare infected with HIV.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nNow, in the rest of the world,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwe've got basically nothing going on in the general population --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nvery, very low levels --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nbut we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nin these other populations who are at highest risk:\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\ndrug injectors, sex workers\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nand gay men.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\n25 percent prevalence among gay men.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nOf course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nYou can only HIV by having unprotected sex\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nwith a positive person.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nIn most of the world,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nthese few prevention failures\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nnotwithstanding,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nwe are actually doing quite well these days\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nin commercial sex:\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\ncondom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nin commercial sex in most countries.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nWhat's rational for public health\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nis also rational for individual sex workers\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nbecause it's really bad for business to have another STI.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nNo one wants it.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo essentially, you're able to achieve\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nquite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nBut in \"intimate\" relations\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nit's much more difficult because,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nwith your wife or your boyfriend\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nor someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nwe have this illusion of romance\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand trust and intimacy,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand nothing is quite so unromantic\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nas the, \"My condom or yours, darling?\" question.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nSo in the face of that,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nyou really need quite a strong incentive\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nto use condoms.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nThis, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nHe's from Haiti and he has AIDS.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nbut he is a reminder in the population,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nof why you might want to be\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nusing condoms.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nThis is also in Haiti and is a reminder\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nof why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nNow, funnily enough, this is also Joseph\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nafter six months on antiretroviral treatment.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nNot for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nBut it is changing the equation\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nof what's rational\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nin sexual decision-making.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nSo, what we've got --\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nsome people say, \"Oh, it doesn't matter very much\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nbecause, actually, treatment is effective prevention\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nbecause it lowers your viral load and therefore\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nmakes it more difficult to transmit HIV.\"\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo, if you look at the viremia thing again,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nif you do start treatment when you're sick,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nwell, what happens? Your viral load comes down.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nBut compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWell, you die,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nso your viral load goes to zero.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAnd all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nwhich are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nor you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nand forgot to take your drugs,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nor because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nall of that is virus\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nthat wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nNow, am I saying, \"Oh, well, great prevention strategy.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nLet's just stop treating people.\"\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nOf course not, of course not.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nWe need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nBut what I am doing is calling into question\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nthose people who say that more treatment\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nis all the prevention we need.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThat's simply not necessarily true,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nin rich countries where treatment has been widely available\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nfor going on 15 years now.\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nAnd what we've seen is\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nthat, actually, condom use rates,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nwhich were very, very high --\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthe gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nwith extremely little help\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nfrom public health nerds, I would say --\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthat condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nfor two reasons really:\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nOne is the assumption of, \"Oh well,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nif he's infected, he's probably on meds,\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nand his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe.\"\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd the other thing is that people are simply\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nnot as scared of HIV\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nas they were of AIDS, and rightly so.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nAIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nand HIV is an invisible virus\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nthat makes you take a pill every day.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nAnd that's boring,\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nbut is it as boring as\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nhaving to use a condom every time you have sex,\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nno matter how drunk you are,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nno matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nIf we look at the data, we can see that\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nthe answer to that question\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nis, mmm.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nSo these are data from Scotland.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nYou see the peak in drug injectors\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbefore they started the national needle exchange program.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nThen it came way down.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nand in drug users,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nyou've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand that's because of that alignment of incentives\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthat I talked about earlier.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut in gay men,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nyou've got quite a dramatic rise\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nstarting three or four years\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nafter treatment became widely available.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nThis is of new infections.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nWhat does that mean?\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nIt means that the combined effect of being less worried\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand having more virus out there in the population --\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nmore people living longer, healthier lives,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nmore likely to be getting laid\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nwith HIV --\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nis outweighing the effects of lower viral load,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nand that's a very worrisome thing.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nWhat does it mean?\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nIt means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nIs that what's happening?\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nNo, and I call it the \"compassion conundrum.\"\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nWe've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nand what's happening really is that people are\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nunable quite to bring themselves to put in\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\ngood sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nunable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nBut once they've gone from being\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:15.958\ntransgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nto being AIDS victims,\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nwe come over all compassionate\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nand buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nIt doesn't make any sense\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nfrom a public health point of view.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nI want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nInes is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nshe's a chick with a dick.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nWhy does she do that job?\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nWell, of course, because she's forced into it\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nbecause she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nAnd if we could just teach her to sew\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nand get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nThis is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.958\non average, 20 cents.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nIt varies a bit province to province.\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nI do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nfor this particular slide,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nand this is what sex workers\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nsay they earn in an hour.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nSo it's not a great job, but for a lot of people\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nit really is quite a rational choice.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nOkay, Ines.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nWe've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nand commitment to preventing HIV too.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nInes: So why is prevalence still rising?\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nIt's all politics.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nWhen you get to politics, nothing makes sense.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nElizabeth Pisani: \"When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.\"\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nSo, from the point of view of a sex worker,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\npoliticians are making no sense.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nFrom the point of view of a public health nerd,\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\njunkies are doing dumb things.\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nThe truth is that everyone has a different rationale.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nThere are as many different ways of being rational\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nas there are human beings on the planet,\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nand that's one of the glories of human existence.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nBut those ways of being rational\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nare not independent of one another,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nso it's rational for\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\na drug injector to share needles\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nbecause of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand it's rational for a politician\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nto make that stupid decision\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nbecause they're responding to\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:15.958\nwhat they think the voters want.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nBut here's the thing:\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nwe are the voters.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nWe're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAnd everyone who's in this room,\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nand everyone who's watching this out there on the web,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nI think, has a duty to demand of their politicians\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nthat we make policy based on scientific evidence\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nand on common sense.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nIt's going to be really hard for us\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nto individually affect what's rational\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nfor every Frankie and every Ines out there,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nbut you can at least use your vote\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nto stop politicians doing stupid things\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nthat spread HIV.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:19:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The emotion behind invention", "duration": "1172", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dean_kamen_the_emotion_behind_invention", "transcript": "It's not about technology, it's about people and stories. I could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video: 60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it. And it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran's administration \u2014 who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago in Vietnam \u2014 who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that don't work. And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background, after he pretty much made his position clear on this \u2014 he had his hook and he had his \u2014 he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that, quote \u2014 his quote \u2014 it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years.But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story, and I'm not going to show you that polished video. I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two, show you an early, crude video because I think it's a better way to tell a story.A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA, the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing. They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers. I get this sort of unrequested \u2014 by me anyway \u2014 visit, and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA.They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers: hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ... They were quite proud of the fact that you know, before the dust clears, if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back, they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States. That's the good news.The bad news is if they've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg, part of the face, it's probably not coming back. So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm. And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger, he said, \"Why is it? At the end of the Civil War, they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm, we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it. Now we've got F18s and F22s, and if somebody loses an arm, we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.\"And they basically said, \"This is unacceptable,\" and then the punchline: \"So, Dean, we're here because you make medical stuff. You're going to give us an arm.\" And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy, paperwork and DODs. No, the guy says, \"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room, and wearing the arm you're going to give us, he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table. If it's the grape, they won't break it.\" Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors. \"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it.\" So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist, flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder. Either way they were going to eat it.\"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame \u2014 namely 32 inches from the long finger \u2014 and weigh less than nine pounds.\" 50th percentile female frame. \"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power.\" So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell, am a bashful guy. I told them they're nuts. (Laughter) They've been watching too much \"Terminator.\" (Laughter) Then, the surgeon says to me, \"Dean, you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral.\" Now, I cannot imagine \u2014 I'm sorry, you may have a better imagination than I do \u2014 I can't imagine losing my arm, and typically at 22 years old. But compared to that, losing two? Seems like that would be an inconvenience.Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it. I literally could not sleep thinking about, \"I wonder how you'd roll over with no shoulders.\" So, I decided we've got to do this. And trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs. Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power .... And I've got a lot of day jobs. But I figured I gotta do this. Did a little investigation, went down to Washington, told them I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it. And I told them I'd build them an arm. I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA, and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional. Look what it takes to make things like iPods. \"Great,\" he said, \"You got two years.\" (Laughter) I said, \"I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year. It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.\" We sort of agreed to disagree.I went back and I started putting a team together, the best guys I could find with a passion to do this. At the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom, all the sensors, all the microprocessors, all the stuff inside. I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see all this cool stuff. I then thought it would be years before we'd be able to make it really, really useful. It turned out, as I think you could see in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes, people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use, two guys \u2014 one that's bilateral. He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side, and he's high trans-humeral on the other. And that's Chuck and Randy together, after 10 hours \u2014 were playing in our office. And we took some pretty cruddy home movies. At the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long, Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of, I can't do it. He picks up a spoon, picks it up, scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk, holds the spoon level as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously, to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk. (Laughter) I cannot do that. (Laughter) His wife was standing behind me. She's standing behind me at the time and she says, \"Dean, Chuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years. So, you've got a choice: We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck.\" (Laughter) (Applause)So, can we see that? This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints. He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him is our engineer/surgeon, which is a convenient guy to have around. There's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them. And just as in the spirit of FIRST, gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this, so they decide to share a drink. This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way. Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it, doing either of those. Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary, at least for my limited physical skill. And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for. He's going to pick up a grape \u2014 he didn't drop it, he didn't break it \u2014 and he's going to eat it. So, that's where we were at the end of about 15 months. (Applause)But, as I've learned from Richard, the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors, is not the story. I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly, this whole segment of the medical world. I'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this. After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design, and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make \u2014 you can always get three out of four of anything you want; the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality \u2014 I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said, \"We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids, because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm. It doesn't matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm.\" When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic, but I told them, \"It really doesn't matter what their opinion is. There is only one opinion that matters, the kids that are either going to use it or not.\"I told a bunch of my engineers, \"Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed, and you're going to see people, lots of them, missing major body parts. They're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated. We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement. But we've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing.\" We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong. We did see a bunch of people, a lot of them missing a lot of body parts, and parts they had left were burned; half a face gone, an ear burned off.They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us. And we started asking them all questions. \"Look,\" I'd say to them, \"We're not quite as good as nature yet. I could give you fine motor control, or I could let you curl 40 pounds; I probably can't do both. I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears, or I can give you power; I can't give you both. And we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them. Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking they're there to help us. \"Well, would it help if I ...\" \"Guys, and woman, you've given enough. We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know what you need.\"After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table who wasn't saying much. You could see he was missing an arm. He was leaning on his other arm. I called down to the end, \"Hey, you haven't said much. If we needed this or this, what would you want?\" And he said, \"You know, I'm the lucky guy at this table. I lost my right arm, but I'm a lefty.\" (Laughter) So, he wouldn't say much. He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits. And he made a few comments. And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys. And that guy pushed himself back from the table ... he has no legs.So, we left. And I was thinking, \"We didn't give them support and encouragement; they gave it to us. They're not finished giving yet.\" It was astounding. So, we went back. And I started working harder, faster. Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center. And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them. And it was astounding how positive they are. So, we went back, and we've been working harder yet. We're in clinical trials, we've got five of them on people. We're screaming along. And I get a call and we go back to Washington.We go back to Walter Reed, and a kid, literally, 20 some-odd days before that was blown up. And they shipped him to Germany and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed. And he was there, and they said we needed to come. And I went down and they rolled him into a room. He's got no legs. He's got no arms. He's got a small residual limb on one side. Half of his face is gone, but they said his vision is coming back. He had one good eye. His name is Brandon Marrocco.And he said, \"I need your arms, but I need two of them.\" \"You'll get them.\" This kid was from Staten Island. And he said, \"I had a truck, before I went over there, and it had a stick. You think I'll be able to drive it?\" \"Sure.\" And I turned around and went, \"How are we going to do this?\" (Laughter) Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them. He doesn't really want a lot. He wants to help. He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies.So, I was on my way out here. I was asked to stop at Texas. There were 3,500 people, the Veteran's Administration, U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event to help the families of all the kids \u2014 some that have died, some that are like Brandon \u2014 and they wanted me to speak. I said, \"What am I going to say? This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you, I can give you ... This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment.\" \"You need to come.\"So, I went. And, as I think you get the point, there were a lot people there recovering. Some further along than others. But universally, these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes, and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them.I'll shut up, except one message or concern I have. I don't think anybody does it intentionally, but there were people there literally talking about, \"Well, how much will they get?\" You know, this country is involved as we've all heard, in this great healthcare debate. \"Who is entitled to what? Who is entitled to how much? Who is going to pay for it?\" Those are tough questions. I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here. It's not possible. It would be nice but let's be realistic.They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there. I don't know the answers. There are other questions that are tough. \"Should we be there? How do we get out? What do we need to do?\" There's very polarized answers to that question too, and I don't have any answers to that. Those are political questions, economic questions, strategic questions. I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement, then. It is an easy answer.I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side. I was talking to one of them, and he was really liking this arm \u2014 it's way, way, way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it \u2014 but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got. But I was saying to him, \"You know, the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903. Wilbur and Orville. But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous. But now we got Eagles out there, F15s, even that Bald Eagle. I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2. I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary.\" And I said to that kid, \"I'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do, and how it does it. And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working until we do that.\"And I think this country ought to continue its great debate, whining and complaining, \"I'm entitled.\" \"You're a victim.\" And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be. But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who's paying for what and how much we get, the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining, I know what they deserve: everything humanly possible. And we ought to give it to them.

We have used such advanced technologies\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nnow and made them available\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nin the most remote places that we put soldiers:\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nhills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThey were quite proud of the fact that\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nyou know, before the dust clears,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nif some soldier has been hurt\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nthey will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthey will be getting world-class triage emergency care\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nfaster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nin a car accident in a major city in the United States.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nThat's the good news.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nThe bad news is if they've collected this person\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand he or she is missing an arm or leg,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.958\npart of the face, it's probably not coming back.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nhe said, \"Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthey were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwe gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nNow we've got F18s and F22s,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand if somebody loses an arm,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwe give them a plastic stick with a hook on it.\"\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd they basically said, \"This is unacceptable,\"\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand then the punchline: \"So, Dean,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nwe're here because you make medical stuff.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nYou're going to give us an arm.\"\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\npaperwork and DODs.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nNo, the guy says,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n\"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nand wearing the arm you're going to give us,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nhe or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\noff this table.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nIf it's the grape, they won't break it.\"\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nGreat he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\n\"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it.\"\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nSo he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nflex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nEither way they were going to eat it.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\n\"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame --\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nnamely 32 inches from the long finger --\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand weigh less than nine pounds.\"\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\n50th percentile female frame.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n\"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power.\"\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nSo, they finished that.

It stands for Self-excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot. It's a robot that has three legs, which is inspired by nature. But have you seen anything in nature, an animal that has three legs? Probably not. So why do I call this a biologically inspired robot? How would it work? But before that, let's look at pop culture. So, you know H.G. Wells's \"War of the Worlds,\" novel and movie. And what you see over here is a very popular video game, and in this fiction, they describe these alien creatures and robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth. But my robot, STriDER, does not move like this.This is an actual dynamic simulation animation. I'm going to show you how the robot works. It flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall. So that's how it walks. But when you look at us human beings, bipedal walking, what you're doing is, you're not really using muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot. What you're doing is, you swing your leg and catch the fall, stand up again, swing your leg and catch the fall. You're using your built-in dynamics, the physics of your body, just like a pendulum. We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion. What you're doing is, when you stand up, potential energy to kinetic energy, potential energy to kinetic energy. It's a constantly falling process. So even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this, really, we're inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.What you see here, this is what we want to do next. We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion. And it deploys legs \u2014 it looks almost like \"Star Wars\" \u2014 so when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking. What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.(Laughter)This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors, because it's 1.8 meters tall, you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things.So we have two prototypes. The first version, in the back, that's STriDER I. The one in front, the smaller, is STriDER II. The problem we had with STriDER I is, it was just too heavy in the body. We had so many motors aligning the joints and those kinds of things. So we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor, we can coordinate all the motions. It's a mechanical solution to a problem, instead of using mechatronics. So with this, now the top body is lighted up; it's walking in our lab. This was the very first successful step. It's still not perfected, its coffee falls down, so we still have a lot of work to do.The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS. It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System. It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot. So think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel, but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub; so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid. We're literally reinventing the wheel here. Let me demonstrate how it works. So in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach. Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes. And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses over these types of terrains.But, when it encounters a very extreme terrain \u2014 in this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot \u2014 then it switches to a deliberate mode, where it uses a laser range finder and camera systems to identify the obstacle and the size. And it carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so it can show this very impressive mobility. You probably haven't seen anything like this out there. This is a very high-mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS. Ah, isn't that cool?When you drive your car, when you steer your car, you use a method called Ackermann steering. The front wheels rotate like this. For most small-wheeled robots, they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turn the opposite direction. For IMPASS, we can do many, many different types of motion. For example, in this case, even though the left and right wheels are connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity, we simply change the length of the spoke, it affects the diameter, then can turn to the left and to the right. These are just some examples of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.This robot is called CLIMBeR: Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot. I've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists \u2014 at JPL, they are famous for the Mars rovers \u2014 and the scientists, geologists always tell me that the real interesting science, the science-rich sites, are always at the cliffs. But the current rovers cannot get there. So, inspired by that, we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment.So this is CLIMBeR. It has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top. It tries to figure out the best place to put its foot. And then once it figures that out, in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip. Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot, and then with the winch, it can climb up these kinds of cliffs. Also for search and rescue applications as well.Five years ago, I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow. And they already had a six-legged robot called LEMUR. So this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS: Multi-Appendage Robotic System. It's a hexapod robot. We developed our adaptive gait planner. We actually have a very interesting payload on there. The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.(Motor sound)It's trying to walk on the coastal terrain, a sandy area, but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand, the foot's soil sinkage model changes, so it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things. It also does some fun stuff. As you can imagine, we get so many visitors visiting our lab. So when the visitors come, MARS walks up to the computer, starts typing, \"Hello, my name is MARS. Welcome to RoMeLa, the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech.\"(Laughter)This robot is an amoeba robot. Now, we don't have enough time to go into technical details, I'll just show you some of the experiments. These are some of the early feasibility experiments. We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move, or use active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA. We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot. We do something to something, and just like magic, it moves. \"The Blob.\"This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL: Robotic Air-Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments. There are a lot of really neat, very good robotic hands out there on the market. The problem is, they're just too expensive \u2014 tens of thousands of dollars. So for prosthesis applications it's probably not too practical, because it's not affordable. We wanted to tackle this problem in a very different direction. Instead of using electrical motors, electromechanical actuators, we're using compressed air. We developed these novel actuators for the joints, so it's compliant. You can actually change the force, simply just changing the air pressure. And it can actually crush an empty soda can. It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg, or in this case, a lightbulb. The best part: it took only 200 dollars to make the first prototype.This robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call HyDRAS, Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine. This is a robot that can climb structures. This is a HyDRAS's arm. It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. But the cool part is the user interface. The cable over there, that's an optical fiber. This student, it's probably her first time using it, but she can articulate it in many different ways. So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone, there are roadside bombs. Currently, you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed. It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm. In this case, it's very intuitive; this student, probably his first time using it, is doing very complex manipulation tasks, picking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that. Very intuitive.Now, this robot is currently our star robot. We actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn: Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence. As you know, we're very interested in human walking, so we decided to build a small humanoid robot. This was in 2004; at that time, this was something really, really revolutionary. This was more of a feasibility study: What kind of motors should we use? Is it even possible? What kinds of controls should we do? This does not have any sensors, so it's an open-loop control. For those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors and there's any disturbances, you know what happens.(Laughter)Based on that success, the following year we did the proper mechanical design, starting from kinematics. And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005. It stands up, it walks \u2014 very impressive. However, still, as you can see, it has a cord, an umbilical cord. So we're still using an external power source and external computation.So in 2006, now it's really time to have fun. Let's give it intelligence. We give it all the computing power it needs: a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip, two FireWire cameras, rate gyros, accelerometers, four forced sensors on the foot, lithium polymer batteries \u2014 and now DARwIn II is completely autonomous. It is not remote controlled. There's no tethers. It looks around, searches for the ball ... looks around, searches for the ball, and it tries to play a game of soccer autonomously \u2014 artificial intelligence. Let's see how it does. This was our very first trial, and ...(Video) Spectators: Goal!Dennis Hong: There is actually a competition called RoboCup. I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup. It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition. And the actual goal of RoboCup is, by the year 2050, we want to have full-size, autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win.(Laughter)It's a true, actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe we can do it.This is last year in China. We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition. This is this year in Austria. You're going to see the action is three against three, completely autonomous.(Video) (Crowd groans)DH: There you go. Yes! The robots track and they team-play amongst themselves. It's very impressive. It's really a research event, packaged in a more exciting competition event. What you see here is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy. This is for the best humanoid. We'd like to bring this, for the first time, to the United States next year, so wish us luck.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)DARwIn also has a lot of other talents. Last year, it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert. This is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV, much smarter, faster, stronger. And it's trying to show off its ability: \"I'm macho, I'm strong.\"(Laughter)\"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion, martial art movements.\"(Laughter)And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV. Again, you'll be able to see it in the lobby. We truly believe this will be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States. So stay tuned.All right. So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work. So, what is the secret of our success? Where do we come up with these ideas? How do we develop these kinds of ideas? We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments. We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge. We also have the world's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind. We call it the Blind Driver Challenge, very exciting. And many, many other robotics projects I want to talk about. These are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things.So really, we have five secrets. First is: Where do we get inspiration? Where do we get this spark of imagination? This is a true story, my personal story. At night, when I go to bed, at three, four in the morning, I lie down, close my eyes, and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around. And they assemble, and they form these kinds of mechanisms. And I think, \"Ah, this is cool.\" So right next to my bed I keep a notebook, a journal, with a special pen that has an LED light on it, because I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife.So I see this, scribble everything down, draw things, and go to bed. Every day in the morning, the first thing I do, before my first cup of coffee, before I brush my teeth, I open my notebook. Many times it's empty; sometimes I have something there. If something's there, sometimes it's junk. But most of the time, I can't read my handwriting. Four in the morning \u2014 what do you expect, right? So I need to decipher what I wrote. But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there, and I have this eureka moment. I directly run to my home office, sit at my computer, I type in the ideas, I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas. So when we have these calls for proposals, I try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem. If there's a match, we write a research proposal, get the research funding in, and that's how we start our research programs.But just a spark of imagination is not good enough. How do we develop these kinds of ideas? At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory, we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions. So we gather around, we discuss problems and solutions and talk about it. But before we start, we set this golden rule. The rule is: nobody criticizes anybody's ideas. Nobody criticizes any opinion. This is important, because many times, students fear or feel uncomfortable about how others might think about their opinions and thoughts.So once you do this, it is amazing how the students open up. They have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas, and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy. And this is how we develop our ideas.Well, we're running out of time. One more thing I want to talk about is, you know, just a spark of idea and development is not good enough. There was a great TED moment \u2014 I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it? He gave a talk about how education and school kill creativity. Well, actually, there's two sides to the story. So there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition. If you want to go beyond a tinkering, if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research, we need more than that. This is where school comes in.Batman, fighting against the bad guys, he has his utility belt, he has his grappling hook, he has all different kinds of gadgets. For us roboticists, engineers and scientists, these tools are the courses and classes you take in class. Math, differential equations. I have linear algebra, science, physics \u2014 even, nowadays, chemistry and biology, as you've seen. These are all the tools we need. So the more tools you have, for Batman, more effective at fighting the bad guys, for us, more tools to attack these kinds of big problems. So education is very important.Also \u2014 it's not only about that. You also have to work really, really hard. So I always tell my students, \"Work smart, then work hard.\" This picture in the back \u2014 this is three in the morning. I guarantee if you come to our lab at 3, 4am, we have students working there, not because I tell them to, but because we are having too much fun. Which leads to the last topic: do not forget to have fun. That's really the secret of our success, we're having too much fun. I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you're having fun, and that's what we're doing. And there you go.Thank you so much.(Applause)", "id": 820, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:15.941\nSo the first robot\nto talk about is called STriDER.\n\n00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:19.434\nIt stands for Self-excited\nTripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.\n\n00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:23.816\nIt's a robot that has three legs,\nwhich is inspired by nature.\n\n00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.869\nBut have you seen anything in nature,\nan animal that has three legs?\n\n00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:31.763\nProbably not. So why do I call this\na biologically inspired robot?\n\n00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:32.949\nHow would it work?\n\n00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:35.135\nBut before that,\nlet's look at pop culture.\n\n00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.627\nSo, you know H.G. Wells's\n\"War of the Worlds,\" novel and movie.\n\n00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:41.972\nAnd what you see over here\nis a very popular video game,\n\n00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:45.696\nand in this fiction, they describe\nthese alien creatures and robots\n\n00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.982\nthat have three legs that terrorize Earth.\n\n00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.541\nBut my robot, STriDER,\ndoes not move like this.\n\n00:00:51.565 --> 00:00:54.616\nThis is an actual dynamic\nsimulation animation.\n\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.697\nI'm going to show you how the robot works.\n\n00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.113\nIt flips its body 180 degrees\n\n00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.195\nand it swings its leg between the two legs\n\n00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.378\nand catches the fall.\n\n00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:03.564\nSo that's how it walks.\n\n00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:06.300\nBut when you look at us\nhuman beings, bipedal walking,\n\n00:01:06.324 --> 00:01:07.482\nwhat you're doing is,\n\n00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:11.593\nyou're not really using muscle\nto lift your leg and walk like a robot.\n\n00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:14.954\nWhat you're doing is,\nyou swing your leg and catch the fall,\n\n00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:17.434\nstand up again, swing your leg\nand catch the fall.\n\n00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:20.625\nYou're using your built-in dynamics,\nthe physics of your body,\n\n00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.400\njust like a pendulum.\n\n00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:25.782\nWe call that the concept\nof passive dynamic locomotion.\n\n00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:27.944\nWhat you're doing is, when you stand up,\n\n00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:30.049\npotential energy to kinetic energy,\n\n00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:32.050\npotential energy to kinetic energy.\n\n00:01:32.074 --> 00:01:34.051\nIt's a constantly falling process.\n\n00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.124\nSo even though there is nothing\nin nature that looks like this,\n\n00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:41.277\nreally, we're inspired by biology\nand applying the principles of walking\n\n00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.458\nto this robot.\n\n00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:44.459\nThus, it's a biologically inspired robot.\n\n00:01:44.483 --> 00:01:46.896\nWhat you see here,\nthis is what we want to do next.\n\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.434\nWe want to fold up the legs\nand shoot it up for long-range motion.\n\n00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.252\nAnd it deploys legs --\nit looks almost like \"Star Wars\" --\n\n00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:56.140\nso when it lands, it absorbs\nthe shock and starts walking.\n\n00:01:56.164 --> 00:01:59.369\nWhat you see over here, this yellow thing,\nthis is not a death ray.\n\n00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:00.405\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.588\nThis is just to show you\n\n00:02:01.612 --> 00:02:04.299\nthat if you have cameras\nor different types of sensors,\n\n00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:05.840\nbecause it's 1.8 meters tall,\n\n00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:08.950\nyou can see over obstacles like bushes\nand those kinds of things.\n\n00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:10.321\nSo we have two prototypes.\n\n00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:13.288\nThe first version,\nin the back, that's STriDER I.\n\n00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:15.479\nThe one in front,\nthe smaller, is STriDER II.\n\n00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:19.011\nThe problem we had with STriDER I is,\nit was just too heavy in the body.\n\n00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:21.619\nWe had so many motors aligning the joints\n\n00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:22.897\nand those kinds of things.\n\n00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:26.121\nSo we decided to synthesize\na mechanical mechanism\n\n00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:29.214\nso we could get rid of all the motors,\nand with a single motor,\n\n00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:30.915\nwe can coordinate all the motions.\n\n00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.316\nIt's a mechanical solution to a problem,\ninstead of using mechatronics.\n\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.752\nSo with this, now the top body\nis lighted up; it's walking in our lab.\n\n00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:39.835\nThis was the very first successful step.\n\n00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.527\nIt's still not perfected,\nits coffee falls down,\n\n00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:44.533\nso we still have a lot of work to do.\n\n00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:48.079\nThe second robot I want\nto talk about is called IMPASS.\n\n00:02:48.103 --> 00:02:52.562\nIt stands for Intelligent Mobility\nPlatform with Actuated Spoke System.\n\n00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:55.181\nIt's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.\n\n00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:59.062\nSo think of a rimless wheel\nor a spoke wheel,\n\n00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:02.063\nbut the spokes individually\nmove in and out of the hub;\n\n00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:04.174\nso, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.\n\n00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:06.440\nWe're literally reinventing\nthe wheel here.\n\n00:03:06.464 --> 00:03:08.927\nLet me demonstrate how it works.\n\n00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.800\nSo in this video we're using an approach\ncalled the reactive approach.\n\n00:03:12.824 --> 00:03:15.801\nJust simply using\nthe tactile sensors on the feet,\n\n00:03:15.825 --> 00:03:18.635\nit's trying to walk\nover a changing terrain,\n\n00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.359\na soft terrain where it pushes\ndown and changes.\n\n00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:23.580\nAnd just by the tactile information,\n\n00:03:23.604 --> 00:03:26.359\nit successfully crosses\nover these types of terrains.\n\n00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:30.188\nBut, when it encounters\na very extreme terrain --\n\n00:03:30.212 --> 00:03:34.125\nin this case, this obstacle\nis more than three times the height\n\n00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.319\nof the robot --\n\n00:03:35.343 --> 00:03:37.217\nthen it switches to a deliberate mode,\n\n00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:40.055\nwhere it uses a laser range finder\nand camera systems\n\n00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.905\nto identify the obstacle and the size.\n\n00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.913\nAnd it carefully plans\nthe motion of the spokes\n\n00:03:44.937 --> 00:03:48.646\nand coordinates it so it can show\nthis very impressive mobility.\n\n00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.311\nYou probably haven't seen\nanything like this out there.\n\n00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:55.005\nThis is a very high-mobility robot\nthat we developed called IMPASS.\n\n00:03:56.571 --> 00:03:58.359\nAh, isn't that cool?\n\n00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:01.677\nWhen you drive your car,\n\n00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:05.623\nwhen you steer your car, you use\na method called Ackermann steering.\n\n00:04:05.647 --> 00:04:07.498\nThe front wheels rotate like this.\n\n00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:10.037\nFor most small-wheeled robots,\n\n00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:12.310\nthey use a method\ncalled differential steering\n\n00:04:12.334 --> 00:04:15.191\nwhere the left and right wheel\nturn the opposite direction.\n\n00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:18.113\nFor IMPASS, we can do many,\nmany different types of motion.\n\n00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:19.406\nFor example, in this case,\n\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.830\neven though the left and right\nwheels are connected\n\n00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:24.620\nwith a single axle rotating\nat the same angle of velocity,\n\n00:04:24.644 --> 00:04:27.778\nwe simply change the length\nof the spoke, it affects the diameter,\n\n00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:29.889\nthen can turn to the left\nand to the right.\n\n00:04:29.913 --> 00:04:33.266\nThese are just some examples\nof the neat things we can do with IMPASS.\n\n00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.064\nThis robot is called CLIMBeR:\n\n00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:38.488\nCable-suspended Limbed Intelligent\nMatching Behavior Robot.\n\n00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:41.639\nI've been talking\nto a lot of NASA JPL scientists --\n\n00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:43.813\nat JPL, they are famous\nfor the Mars rovers --\n\n00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:46.208\nand the scientists,\ngeologists always tell me\n\n00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:49.359\nthat the real interesting science,\nthe science-rich sites,\n\n00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:50.894\nare always at the cliffs.\n\n00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:52.868\nBut the current rovers cannot get there.\n\n00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:55.375\nSo, inspired by that,\nwe wanted to build a robot\n\n00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:58.516\nthat can climb\na structured cliff environment.\n\n00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.764\nSo this is CLIMBeR.\n\n00:04:59.788 --> 00:05:01.299\nIt has three legs.\n\n00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:04.906\nIt's probably difficult to see, but it has\na winch and a cable at the top.\n\n00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.511\nIt tries to figure out\nthe best place to put its foot.\n\n00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:09.170\nAnd then once it figures that out,\n\n00:05:09.194 --> 00:05:12.171\nin real time, it calculates\nthe force distribution:\n\n00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:14.718\nhow much force it needs\nto exert to the surface\n\n00:05:14.742 --> 00:05:16.719\nso it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.\n\n00:05:16.743 --> 00:05:18.884\nOnce it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,\n\n00:05:18.908 --> 00:05:22.211\nand then with the winch,\nit can climb up these kinds of cliffs.\n\n00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:25.359\nAlso for search and rescue\napplications as well.\n\n00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:27.802\nFive years ago,\nI actually worked at NASA JPL\n\n00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:29.676\nduring the summer as a faculty fellow.\n\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.150\nAnd they already had\na six-legged robot called LEMUR.\n\n00:05:33.174 --> 00:05:34.814\nSo this is actually based on that.\n\n00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:36.129\nThis robot is called MARS:\n\n00:05:36.153 --> 00:05:37.770\nMulti-Appendage Robotic System.\n\n00:05:37.794 --> 00:05:39.032\nIt's a hexapod robot.\n\n00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:41.033\nWe developed our adaptive gait planner.\n\n00:05:41.057 --> 00:05:43.582\nWe actually have a very interesting\npayload on there.\n\n00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:45.053\nThe students like to have fun.\n\n00:05:45.077 --> 00:05:48.172\nAnd here you can see that it's walking\nover unstructured terrain.\n\n00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:49.313\n(Motor sound)\n\n00:05:49.337 --> 00:05:52.134\nIt's trying to walk\non the coastal terrain, a sandy area,\n\n00:05:52.158 --> 00:05:56.806\nbut depending on the moisture content\nor the grain size of the sand,\n\n00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.674\nthe foot's soil sinkage model changes,\nso it tries to adapt its gait\n\n00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:02.938\nto successfully cross\nover these kind of things.\n\n00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.469\nIt also does some fun stuff.\n\n00:06:04.493 --> 00:06:07.978\nAs you can imagine,\nwe get so many visitors visiting our lab.\n\n00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:10.734\nSo when the visitors come,\nMARS walks up to the computer,\n\n00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:12.806\nstarts typing, \"Hello, my name is MARS.\n\n00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.359\nWelcome to RoMeLa,\n\n00:06:14.383 --> 00:06:16.996\nthe Robotics Mechanisms\nLaboratory at Virginia Tech.\"\n\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.490\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:20.639\nThis robot is an amoeba robot.\n\n00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:23.551\nNow, we don't have enough time\nto go into technical details,\n\n00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:25.632\nI'll just show you\nsome of the experiments.\n\n00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:28.168\nThese are some of the early\nfeasibility experiments.\n\n00:06:28.192 --> 00:06:31.277\nWe store potential energy\nto the elastic skin to make it move,\n\n00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:35.104\nor use active tension cords\nto make it move forward and backward.\n\n00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:36.285\nIt's called ChIMERA.\n\n00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.321\nWe also have been working\nwith some scientists and engineers\n\n00:06:39.345 --> 00:06:40.496\nfrom UPenn\n\n00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.353\nto come up with a chemically actuated\nversion of this amoeba robot.\n\n00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:46.260\nWe do something to something,\n\n00:06:46.284 --> 00:06:48.952\nand just like magic, it moves.\n\n00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:51.166\n\"The Blob.\"\n\n00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:53.668\nThis robot is a very recent project.\n\n00:06:53.692 --> 00:06:54.843\nIt's called RAPHaEL:\n\n00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:57.554\nRobotic Air-Powered Hand\nwith Elastic Ligaments.\n\n00:06:57.578 --> 00:07:00.577\nThere are a lot of really neat,\nvery good robotic hands\n\n00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:01.764\nout there on the market.\n\n00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.968\nThe problem is,\nthey're just too expensive --\n\n00:07:03.992 --> 00:07:05.397\ntens of thousands of dollars.\n\n00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.442\nSo for prosthesis applications\nit's probably not too practical,\n\n00:07:08.466 --> 00:07:09.811\nbecause it's not affordable.\n\n00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:13.309\nWe wanted to tackle this problem\nin a very different direction.\n\n00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:16.382\nInstead of using electrical motors,\nelectromechanical actuators,\n\n00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:18.162\nwe're using compressed air.\n\n00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:21.633\nWe developed these novel actuators\nfor the joints, so it's compliant.\n\n00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:23.359\nYou can actually change the force,\n\n00:07:23.383 --> 00:07:25.209\nsimply just changing the air pressure.\n\n00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:27.423\nAnd it can actually crush\nan empty soda can.\n\n00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.497\nIt can pick up very delicate\nobjects like a raw egg,\n\n00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:32.109\nor in this case, a lightbulb.\n\n00:07:32.748 --> 00:07:36.417\nThe best part: it took only 200 dollars\nto make the first prototype.\n\n00:07:37.864 --> 00:07:40.612\nThis robot is actually\na family of snake robots\n\n00:07:40.636 --> 00:07:42.004\nthat we call HyDRAS,\n\n00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:44.739\nHyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic\nArticulated Serpentine.\n\n00:07:44.763 --> 00:07:46.934\nThis is a robot that can climb structures.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.041\nThis is a HyDRAS's arm.\n\n00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:51.074\nIt's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.\n\n00:07:51.098 --> 00:07:53.446\nBut the cool part is the user interface.\n\n00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.213\nThe cable over there,\nthat's an optical fiber.\n\n00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:58.673\nThis student, it's probably\nher first time using it,\n\n00:07:58.697 --> 00:08:01.054\nbut she can articulate it\nin many different ways.\n\n00:08:01.078 --> 00:08:04.541\nSo, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,\nthere are roadside bombs.\n\n00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:08.576\nCurrently, you send these remotely\ncontrolled vehicles that are armed.\n\n00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.139\nIt takes really a lot of time\nand it's expensive to train the operator\n\n00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:13.901\nto operate this complex arm.\n\n00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:15.892\nIn this case, it's very intuitive;\n\n00:08:15.916 --> 00:08:18.184\nthis student, probably\nhis first time using it,\n\n00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.186\nis doing very complex manipulation tasks,\n\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.571\npicking up objects and doing\nmanipulation, just like that.\n\n00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:24.800\nVery intuitive.\n\n00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:29.320\nNow, this robot\nis currently our star robot.\n\n00:08:29.344 --> 00:08:32.329\nWe actually have a fan club\nfor the robot, DARwIn:\n\n00:08:32.353 --> 00:08:35.254\nDynamic Anthropomorphic\nRobot with Intelligence.\n\n00:08:35.278 --> 00:08:39.161\nAs you know, we're very interested\nin human walking,\n\n00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.377\nso we decided to build\na small humanoid robot.\n\n00:08:41.401 --> 00:08:43.163\nThis was in 2004; at that time,\n\n00:08:43.187 --> 00:08:45.457\nthis was something really,\nreally revolutionary.\n\n00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:47.282\nThis was more of a feasibility study:\n\n00:08:47.306 --> 00:08:49.957\nWhat kind of motors should we use?\nIs it even possible?\n\n00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:51.715\nWhat kinds of controls should we do?\n\n00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:55.259\nThis does not have any sensors,\nso it's an open-loop control.\n\n00:08:55.283 --> 00:08:58.053\nFor those who probably know,\nif you don't have any sensors\n\n00:08:58.077 --> 00:09:00.650\nand there's any disturbances,\nyou know what happens.\n\n00:09:00.674 --> 00:09:02.787\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:08.035\nBased on that success, the following year\nwe did the proper mechanical design,\n\n00:09:08.059 --> 00:09:09.283\nstarting from kinematics.\n\n00:09:09.307 --> 00:09:12.217\nAnd thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.\n\n00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.552\nIt stands up, it walks -- very impressive.\n\n00:09:14.576 --> 00:09:17.933\nHowever, still, as you can see,\nit has a cord, an umbilical cord.\n\n00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:20.129\nSo we're still using\nan external power source\n\n00:09:20.153 --> 00:09:21.752\nand external computation.\n\n00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.011\nSo in 2006, now it's really\ntime to have fun.\n\n00:09:26.035 --> 00:09:27.494\nLet's give it intelligence.\n\n00:09:27.518 --> 00:09:29.639\nWe give it all the computing\npower it needs:\n\n00:09:29.663 --> 00:09:32.193\na 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,\ntwo FireWire cameras,\n\n00:09:32.217 --> 00:09:35.063\nrate gyros, accelerometers,\nfour forced sensors on the foot,\n\n00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:36.437\nlithium polymer batteries --\n\n00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:39.611\nand now DARwIn II\nis completely autonomous.\n\n00:09:40.104 --> 00:09:42.795\nIt is not remote controlled.\nThere's no tethers.\n\n00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:46.552\nIt looks around, searches for the ball ...\nlooks around, searches for the ball,\n\n00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:51.505\nand it tries to play a game of soccer\nautonomously -- artificial intelligence.\n\n00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:52.683\nLet's see how it does.\n\n00:09:52.707 --> 00:09:54.654\nThis was our very first trial, and ...\n\n00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:59.045\n(Video) Spectators: Goal!\n\n00:10:00.196 --> 00:10:03.146\nDennis Hong: There is actually\na competition called RoboCup.\n\n00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.757\nI don't know how many of you\nhave heard about RoboCup.\n\n00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:10.155\nIt's an international autonomous\nrobot soccer competition.\n\n00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:12.927\nAnd the actual goal of RoboCup is,\n\n00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.144\nby the year 2050,\n\n00:10:15.168 --> 00:10:18.899\nwe want to have full-size,\nautonomous humanoid robots\n\n00:10:18.923 --> 00:10:21.997\nplay soccer against the human\nWorld Cup champions\n\n00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:23.174\nand win.\n\n00:10:23.198 --> 00:10:24.230\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:24.254 --> 00:10:25.472\nIt's a true, actual goal.\n\n00:10:25.496 --> 00:10:29.393\nIt's a very ambitious goal,\nbut we truly believe we can do it.\n\n00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.151\nThis is last year in China.\n\n00:10:31.175 --> 00:10:34.188\nWe were the very first team\nin the United States that qualified\n\n00:10:34.212 --> 00:10:36.012\nin the humanoid RoboCup competition.\n\n00:10:36.036 --> 00:10:38.216\nThis is this year in Austria.\n\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.807\nYou're going to see the action\nis three against three,\n\n00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:42.022\ncompletely autonomous.\n\n00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.137\n(Video) (Crowd groans)\n\n00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:44.491\nDH: There you go. Yes!\n\n00:10:45.289 --> 00:10:49.431\nThe robots track and they team-play\namongst themselves.\n\n00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:51.043\nIt's very impressive.\n\n00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:52.543\nIt's really a research event,\n\n00:10:52.567 --> 00:10:56.807\npackaged in a more exciting\ncompetition event.\n\n00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:00.359\nWhat you see here is the beautiful\nLouis Vuitton Cup trophy.\n\n00:11:00.383 --> 00:11:01.902\nThis is for the best humanoid.\n\n00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:05.595\nWe'd like to bring this, for the first\ntime, to the United States next year,\n\n00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:06.774\nso wish us luck.\n\n00:11:06.798 --> 00:11:07.834\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:07.858 --> 00:11:09.010\nThank you.\n\n00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:11.115\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:11.139 --> 00:11:13.207\nDARwIn also has a lot of other talents.\n\n00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:16.947\nLast year, it actually conducted\nthe Roanoke Symphony Orchestra\n\n00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:19.359\nfor the holiday concert.\n\n00:11:19.383 --> 00:11:22.359\nThis is the next generation\nrobot, DARwIn IV,\n\n00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:25.359\nmuch smarter, faster, stronger.\n\n00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:27.360\nAnd it's trying to show off its ability:\n\n00:11:27.384 --> 00:11:29.181\n\"I'm macho, I'm strong.\"\n\n00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:30.649\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:34.898\n\"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,\nmartial art movements.\"\n\n00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:38.383 --> 00:11:40.318\nAnd it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.\n\n00:11:40.342 --> 00:11:42.477\nAgain, you'll be able\nto see it in the lobby.\n\n00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:45.693\nWe truly believe this will be\nthe very first running humanoid robot\n\n00:11:45.717 --> 00:11:46.868\nin the United States.\n\n00:11:46.892 --> 00:11:48.046\nSo stay tuned.\n\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.071\nAll right. So I showed you\nsome of our exciting robots at work.\n\n00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:53.283\nSo, what is the secret of our success?\n\n00:11:53.307 --> 00:11:55.124\nWhere do we come up with these ideas?\n\n00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:57.041\nHow do we develop these kinds of ideas?\n\n00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:58.855\nWe have a fully autonomous vehicle\n\n00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:00.755\nthat can drive into urban environments.\n\n00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:03.678\nWe won a half a million dollars\nin the DARPA Urban Challenge.\n\n00:12:03.702 --> 00:12:07.359\nWe also have the world's very first\nvehicle that can be driven by the blind.\n\n00:12:07.383 --> 00:12:09.907\nWe call it the Blind Driver\nChallenge, very exciting.\n\n00:12:09.931 --> 00:12:13.103\nAnd many, many other robotics\nprojects I want to talk about.\n\n00:12:13.127 --> 00:12:15.764\nThese are just the awards\nthat we won in 2007 fall\n\n00:12:15.788 --> 00:12:18.359\nfrom robotics competitions\nand those kinds of things.\n\n00:12:18.383 --> 00:12:20.276\nSo really, we have five secrets.\n\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.736\nFirst is: Where do we get inspiration?\n\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.839\nWhere do we get this spark of imagination?\n\n00:12:24.863 --> 00:12:26.884\nThis is a true story, my personal story.\n\n00:12:26.908 --> 00:12:29.685\nAt night, when I go to bed,\nat three, four in the morning,\n\n00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:32.598\nI lie down, close my eyes,\nand I see these lines and circles\n\n00:12:32.622 --> 00:12:34.416\nand different shapes floating around.\n\n00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.203\nAnd they assemble, and they form\nthese kinds of mechanisms.\n\n00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:38.835\nAnd I think, \"Ah, this is cool.\"\n\n00:12:38.859 --> 00:12:41.736\nSo right next to my bed\nI keep a notebook, a journal,\n\n00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.116\nwith a special pen\nthat has an LED light on it,\n\n00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.177\nbecause I don't want to turn on the light\nand wake up my wife.\n\n00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:50.470\nSo I see this, scribble everything down,\ndraw things, and go to bed.\n\n00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:52.884\nEvery day in the morning,\nthe first thing I do,\n\n00:12:52.908 --> 00:12:55.515\nbefore my first cup of coffee,\nbefore I brush my teeth,\n\n00:12:55.539 --> 00:12:56.701\nI open my notebook.\n\n00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:59.388\nMany times it's empty;\nsometimes I have something there.\n\n00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:01.478\nIf something's there, sometimes it's junk.\n\n00:13:01.502 --> 00:13:03.859\nBut most of the time,\nI can't read my handwriting.\n\n00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:06.207\nFour in the morning --\nwhat do you expect, right?\n\n00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:08.135\nSo I need to decipher what I wrote.\n\n00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:11.359\nBut sometimes I see\nthis ingenious idea in there,\n\n00:13:11.383 --> 00:13:12.868\nand I have this eureka moment.\n\n00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:15.408\nI directly run to my home office,\nsit at my computer,\n\n00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.409\nI type in the ideas, I sketch things out\n\n00:13:17.433 --> 00:13:19.324\nand I keep a database of ideas.\n\n00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:22.347\nSo when we have these calls for proposals,\n\n00:13:22.371 --> 00:13:25.941\nI try to find a match\nbetween my potential ideas\n\n00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:27.125\nand the problem.\n\n00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:29.466\nIf there's a match,\nwe write a research proposal,\n\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.837\nget the research funding in,\n\n00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:33.021\nand that's how we start\nour research programs.\n\n00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.538\nBut just a spark of imagination\nis not good enough.\n\n00:13:35.562 --> 00:13:37.442\nHow do we develop these kinds of ideas?\n\n00:13:37.466 --> 00:13:40.246\nAt our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics\nand Mechanisms Laboratory,\n\n00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.882\nwe have these fantastic\nbrainstorming sessions.\n\n00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:47.241\nSo we gather around, we discuss problems\nand solutions and talk about it.\n\n00:13:47.265 --> 00:13:50.242\nBut before we start,\nwe set this golden rule.\n\n00:13:50.266 --> 00:13:51.915\nThe rule is:\n\n00:13:51.939 --> 00:13:54.916\nnobody criticizes anybody's ideas.\n\n00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.945\nNobody criticizes any opinion.\n\n00:13:57.383 --> 00:14:00.930\nThis is important, because many times,\nstudents fear or feel uncomfortable\n\n00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:04.223\nabout how others might think\nabout their opinions and thoughts.\n\n00:14:04.247 --> 00:14:08.037\nSo once you do this, it is amazing\nhow the students open up.\n\n00:14:08.061 --> 00:14:11.359\nThey have these wacky, cool,\ncrazy, brilliant ideas,\n\n00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:14.812\nand the whole room is just electrified\nwith creative energy.\n\n00:14:14.836 --> 00:14:17.109\nAnd this is how we develop our ideas.\n\n00:14:17.696 --> 00:14:19.253\nWell, we're running out of time.\n\n00:14:19.277 --> 00:14:21.179\nOne more thing I want to talk about is,\n\n00:14:21.203 --> 00:14:24.359\nyou know, just a spark of idea\nand development is not good enough.\n\n00:14:24.383 --> 00:14:29.094\nThere was a great TED moment --\nI think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?\n\n00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:33.556\nHe gave a talk about how education\nand school kill creativity.\n\n00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.359\nWell, actually,\nthere's two sides to the story.\n\n00:14:36.383 --> 00:14:41.596\nSo there is only so much one can do\nwith just ingenious ideas\n\n00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.636\nand creativity\nand good engineering intuition.\n\n00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.454\nIf you want to go beyond a tinkering,\n\n00:14:46.478 --> 00:14:48.628\nif you want to go\nbeyond a hobby of robotics\n\n00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:52.093\nand really tackle\nthe grand challenges of robotics\n\n00:14:52.117 --> 00:14:53.359\nthrough rigorous research,\n\n00:14:53.383 --> 00:14:54.538\nwe need more than that.\n\n00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:56.576\nThis is where school comes in.\n\n00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.094\nBatman, fighting against the bad guys,\n\n00:14:59.118 --> 00:15:01.511\nhe has his utility belt,\nhe has his grappling hook,\n\n00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:03.359\nhe has all different kinds of gadgets.\n\n00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:05.796\nFor us roboticists,\nengineers and scientists,\n\n00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.977\nthese tools are the courses\nand classes you take in class.\n\n00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:12.003\nMath, differential equations.\n\n00:15:12.027 --> 00:15:14.767\nI have linear algebra, science, physics --\n\n00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.759\neven, nowadays, chemistry\nand biology, as you've seen.\n\n00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:19.541\nThese are all the tools we need.\n\n00:15:19.565 --> 00:15:21.441\nSo the more tools you have, for Batman,\n\n00:15:21.465 --> 00:15:23.442\nmore effective at fighting the bad guys,\n\n00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:26.372\nfor us, more tools to attack\nthese kinds of big problems.\n\n00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.405\nSo education is very important.\n\n00:15:30.526 --> 00:15:33.123\nAlso -- it's not only about that.\n\n00:15:33.147 --> 00:15:35.215\nYou also have to work really, really hard.\n\n00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:36.692\nSo I always tell my students,\n\n00:15:36.716 --> 00:15:38.767\n\"Work smart, then work hard.\"\n\n00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:41.515\nThis picture in the back --\nthis is three in the morning.\n\n00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:43.868\nI guarantee if you come\nto our lab at 3, 4am,\n\n00:15:43.892 --> 00:15:45.448\nwe have students working there,\n\n00:15:45.472 --> 00:15:48.681\nnot because I tell them to,\nbut because we are having too much fun.\n\n00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:50.359\nWhich leads to the last topic:\n\n00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:52.252\ndo not forget to have fun.\n\n00:15:52.276 --> 00:15:55.489\nThat's really the secret of our success,\nwe're having too much fun.\n\n00:15:55.513 --> 00:15:58.979\nI truly believe that highest productivity\ncomes when you're having fun,\n\n00:15:59.003 --> 00:16:00.359\nand that's what we're doing.\n\n00:16:00.383 --> 00:16:01.537\nAnd there you go.\n\n00:16:01.561 --> 00:16:02.728\nThank you so much.\n\n00:16:02.752 --> 00:16:06.854\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Every pollen grain has a story", "duration": "432", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_drori_every_pollen_grain_has_a_story", "transcript": "Thank you. I have two missions here today. The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope, and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose. And, secondly, to convince you that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope. (Laughter) Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers. It carries male sex cells from one flower to another. This gives us genetic diversity, or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity. And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself. That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers. Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen, so, it's quite prolific stuff. And it isn't just bright flowers that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses. And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen. The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later, but that's for the pollen tube to come out later on. A very tiny tube. So, that's 20 micrometers across, that pollen grain there. That's about a 50th of a millimeter. But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.This is Morina. This is a plant \u2014 which I've always thought to be rather tedious \u2014 named after Morin, who was an enterprising French gardener, who issued the first seed catalog in 1621. But anyway, take a look at its pollen. This is amazing, I think. That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube, and when the pollen finds its special female spot in another Morina flower, just on the right species, what happens? Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells. If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex, they have rampant, promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really. (Laughter) A lot.My story is actually not about plant propagation, but about pollen itself. \"So, what are pollen's properties?\" I hear you ask. First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that. It's also very biologically active, as anyone with hay fever will understand. Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed \u2014 like trees and grasses and so on \u2014 tend to cause the most hay fever. And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out masses and masses of pollen to have any chance of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.Here are some examples \u2014 they're very smooth if you look at them \u2014 of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind. Again \u2014 this time, sycamore \u2014 wind-dispersed. So, trees: very boring flowers, not really trying to attract insects. Cool pollen, though. This one I particularly like. This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks to make the pollen carry even further. Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding. This is a bee's leg with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant. And this is the outrageous and beautiful flower of the mangrove palm. Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding. The pollen has little barbs on it, if we look. Now, those little barbs obviously stick to the insects well, but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph, and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth. That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen. And I'm rather proud to say that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago London was full of mangroves. Isn't that cool? (Laughter)Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects. You can tell that from the little barbs on there. All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope, actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories. No coincidence that these were taken by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist, and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen. (Laughter)Now, all this diversity means that you can look at a pollen grain and tell what species it came from, and that's actually quite handy if you maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from. So, different species of plants grow in different places, and some pollen carries further than others. So, if you have a pollen sample, then in principle, you should be able to tell where that sample came from. And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them. So, not only does each type of pollen look different, but each habitat has a different combination of plants. A different pollen signature, if you like, or a different pollen fingerprint. By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample, you can tell very precisely where it came from. This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt, similar to the one that I'm wearing now. Now, much of the pollen will still be there after repeated washings. Where has it been? Four very different habitats might look similar, but they've got very different pollen signatures. Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken in different countries.But pollen forensics can be very subtle. It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made, where banknotes have come from, to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did. And murder suspects have been tracked using their clothing, certainly in the U.K., to within an area that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs to find the murder victim. So, you can tell from a piece of clothing to within about a kilometer or so, where that piece of clothing has been recently and then send in dogs. And finally, in a rather grizzly way, the Bosnia war crimes; some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial because of the evidence from pollen, which showed that bodies had been buried, exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.I hope I've opened your eyes, if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter) to some of pollen's secrets. This is a horse chestnut. There is an invisible beauty all around us, each grain with a story to tell ... each of us, in fact, with a story to tell from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us. Thank you to the colleagues at Kew, and thank you to palynologists everywhere.

Yes we know that.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nIt's also very biologically active,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nas anyone with hay fever will understand.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nNow, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nlike trees and grasses and so on --\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\ntend to cause the most hay fever.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nAnd the reason for that is they've got to chuck out\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nmasses and masses of pollen to have any chance\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nof the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nHere are some examples --\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthey're very smooth if you look at them --\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nof tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nAgain -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo, trees: very boring flowers,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nnot really trying to attract insects.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nCool pollen, though.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThis one I particularly like.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThis is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nto make the pollen carry even further.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nRemember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nThis is a bee's leg\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nwith the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd this is the outrageous and beautiful\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nflower of the mangrove palm.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nVery showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThe pollen has little barbs on it,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nif we look.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nNow, those little barbs\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nobviously stick to the insects well,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nbut there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand that is that you might be able to see a fracture line\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nacross what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nThat tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nAnd I'm rather proud to say\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthat this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nLondon was full of mangroves.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nIsn't that cool?\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nOkay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nYou can tell that from the little barbs on there.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAll these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nactually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nNo coincidence that these were taken\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nby Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nand I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nlike him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nNow, all this diversity\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nmeans that you can look at a pollen grain\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand tell what species it came from,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand that's actually quite handy if you\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nmaybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nSo, different species of plants\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\ngrow in different places,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nand some pollen carries further than others.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nSo, if you have a pollen sample,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nthen in principle, you should be able to tell\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nwhere that sample came from.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd this is where it gets interesting for forensics.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nPollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nSo, not only does each type of pollen look different,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nbut each habitat has a different combination of plants.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nA different pollen signature, if you like,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nor a different pollen fingerprint.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBy looking at the proportions and combinations\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nof different kinds of pollen in a sample,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nyou can tell very precisely where it came from.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nThis is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nsimilar to the one that I'm wearing now.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nNow, much of the pollen will still be there\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nafter repeated washings.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWhere has it been?\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nFour very different habitats might look similar,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nbut they've got very different pollen signatures.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nActually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nin different countries.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nBut pollen forensics can be very subtle.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIt's being used now to track\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwhere counterfeit drugs have been made,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nwhere banknotes have come from,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nto look at the provenance of antiques\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand see that they really did come from the place\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthe seller said they did.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nAnd murder suspects have been tracked\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nusing their clothing,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\ncertainly in the U.K., to within an area\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthat's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nto find the murder victim.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nSo, you can tell from a piece of clothing\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nto within about a kilometer or so,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwhere that piece of clothing has been recently\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nand then send in dogs.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nAnd finally, in a rather grizzly way,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthe Bosnia war crimes;\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nsome of the people brought to trial were brought to trial\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nbecause of the evidence from pollen,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nwhich showed that bodies had been buried,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nexhumed and then reburied somewhere else.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nI hope I've opened your eyes,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nif you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nto some of pollen's secrets.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nThis is a horse chestnut.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThere is an invisible beauty all around us,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\neach grain with a story to tell ...\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\neach of us, in fact, with a story to tell\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nfrom the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThank you to the colleagues at Kew,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nand thank you to palynologists everywhere.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\n(Applause)"}]

I feel like a fish out of water, or maybe an owl out of the air.(Laughter)I was preaching in San Jose some time ago, and my friend Mark Kvamme, who helped introduce me to this conference, brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me, or I with them. And I was so stimulated. And had such \u2014 it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science. I know that we're near the end of this conference, and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion. Richard can answer that, because he made that decision.But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia, coming down. I was to address a conference at a hotel. And on that elevator a man said, \"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.\" And another man looked in my direction and said, \"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us.\" And this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds, and he said, \"My, what an anticlimax!\"(Laughter)I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is not a \u2014 is an anticlimax, after all these tremendous talks that you've heard, and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them. But I was on an airplane in the east some years ago, and the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him. And there was a drunk man on there, and he got up out of his seat two or three times, and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do. And he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by, and everybody was upset with him. And finally, John Belk said, \"Do you know who's sitting here?\" And the man said, \"No, who?\" He said, \"It's Billy Graham, the preacher.\" He said, \"You don't say!\" And he turned to me, and he said, \"Put her there!\" He said, \"Your sermons have certainly helped me.\"(Laughter)And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people.(Laughter)I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight, I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be. But I won't, because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year, and I know that my time is brief. I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs, and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here, because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that, and some other problems that I won't talk about.(Laughter)But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution. We've had others. And there's one that I want to talk about. In one generation, the nation of the people of Israel had a tremendous and dramatic change that made them a great power in the Near East. A man by the name of David came to the throne, and King David became one of the great leaders of his generation. He was a man of tremendous leadership. He had the favor of God with him. He was a brilliant poet, philosopher, writer, soldier \u2014 with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today.But about two centuries before David, the Hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron, and, slowly, that skill spread. But they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it, or to have any. But David changed all of that, and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel. And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron, and which archaeologists have found, that in present-day Palestine, there are evidences of that generation. Now, instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones, Israel now had iron plows, and sickles, and hoes and military weapons. And in the course of one generation, Israel was completely changed. The introduction of iron, in some ways, had an impact a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation. And David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve.There were many problems still left. And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them, and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that. How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention? The first one that David saw was human evil. Where does it come from? How do we solve it? Over again and again in the Psalms, which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world, David describes the evils of the human race. And yet he says, \"He restores my soul.\" Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are? On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology, as this conference vividly demonstrates. We've seen under the sea, three miles down, or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future.But on the other hand, something is wrong. Our battleships, our soldiers, are on a frontier now, almost ready to go to war with Iraq. Now, what causes this? Why do we have these wars in every generation, and in every part of the world? And revolutions? We can't get along with other people, even in our own families. We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break. Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world, bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death. Even the most sophisticated among us seem powerless to break this cycle. I would like to see Oracle take up that, or some other technological geniuses work on this. How do we change man, so that he doesn't lie and cheat, and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever?The Bible says the problem is within us, within our hearts and our souls. Our problem is that we are separated from our Creator, which we call God, and we need to have our souls restored, something only God can do. Jesus said, \"For out of the heart come evil thoughts: murders, sexual immorality, theft, false testimonies, slander.\" The British philosopher Bertrand Russell was not a religious man, but he said, \"It's in our hearts that the evil lies, and it's from our hearts that it must be plucked out.\" Albert Einstein \u2014 I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton, and I met Mr. Einstein. He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said nobody was qualified to give him one.(Laughter)But he made this statement. He said, \"It's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.\" And many of you, I'm sure, have thought about that and puzzled over it. You've seen people take beneficial technological advances, such as the Internet we've heard about tonight, and twist them into something corrupting. You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems. The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology, horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it. King David said that he knew the depths of his own soul. He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery. Yet King David sought God's forgiveness, and said, \"You can restore my soul.\"You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind. We are a soul. And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding. That's the part of us that yearns for God, or something more than we find in technology. Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life, and which seeks for something beyond this life. It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God. I find [that] young people all over the world are searching for something. They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities, and I have many questions and answer periods, and whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard, or Oxford \u2014 I've spoken at all of those universities. I'm going to Harvard in about three or four \u2014 no, it's about two months from now \u2014 to give a lecture. And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked the last few times I've been there. And it'll be on these questions: where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? What's life all about? Why am I here?Even if you have no religious belief, there are times when you wonder that there's something else. Thomas Edison also said, \"When you see everything that happens in the world of science, and in the working of the universe, you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.\" I remember once, I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev at a White House dinner. I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well. And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists, and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect. And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well, and I said, \"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight. What shall I talk to her about?\" And he surprised me with the answer. He said, \"Talk to her about religion and philosophy. That's what she's really interested in.\" I was a little bit surprised, but that evening that's what we talked about, and it was a stimulating conversation. And afterward, she said, \"You know, I'm an atheist, but I know that there's something up there higher than we are.\"The second problem that King David realized he could not solve was the problem of human suffering. Writing the oldest book in the world was Job, and he said, \"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.\" Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back certain types of human suffering. But I'm \u2014 in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age. I admit that I'm very grateful for all the medical advances that have kept me in relatively good health all these years. My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me not to take this trip out here to this \u2014 to be here. I haven't given a talk in nearly four months. And when you speak as much as I do, three or four times a day, you get rusty. That's the reason I'm using this podium and using these notes. Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere, I'm ad-libbing. I'm not reading. I never read an address. I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture. I talk ad lib. But tonight, I've got some notes here so that if I begin to forget, which I do sometimes, I've got something I can turn to.But even here among us, most \u2014 in the most advanced society in the world, we have poverty. We have families that self-destruct, friends that betray us. Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us. I've never met a person in the world that didn't have a problem or a worry. Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question that we haven't answered. Yet David again and again said that he would turn to God. He said, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\" The final problem that David knew he could not solve was death. Many commentators have said that death is the forbidden subject of our generation. Most people live as if they're never going to die. Technology projects the myth of control over our mortality. We see people on our screens. Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen as she was in person, and our \u2014 many young people think she's still alive. They don't know that she's dead. Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is. The old stars, they come to life. And they're \u2014 they're just as great on that screen as they were in person. But death is inevitable.I spoke some time ago to a joint session of Congress, last year. And we were meeting in that room, the statue room. About 300 of them were there. And I said, \"There's one thing that we have in common in this room, all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat, or whoever.\" I said, \"We're all going to die. And we have that in common with all these great men of the past that are staring down at us.\" And it's often difficult for young people to understand that. It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die. As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote, he said, there's every activity under heaven. There's a time to be born, and there's a time to die. I've stood at the deathbed of several famous people, whom you would know. I've talked to them. I've seen them in those agonizing moments when they were scared to death.And yet, a few years earlier, death never crossed their mind. I talked to a woman this past week whose father was a famous doctor. She said he never thought of God, never talked about God, didn't believe in God. He was an atheist. But she said, as he came to die, he sat up on the side of the bed one day, and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain. And he said, for the first time in his life he'd thought about the inevitable, and about God. Was there a God? A few years ago, a university student asked me, \"What is the greatest surprise in your life?\" And I said, \"The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life. It passes so fast.\" But it does not need to have to be that way. Wernher von Braun, in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote: \"science and religion are not antagonists. On the contrary, they're sisters.\" He put it on a personal basis. I knew Dr. von Braun very well. And he said, \"Speaking for myself, I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos serves only to confirm a belief in the certainty of a creator.\" He also said, \"In our search to know God, I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration. The reality of this life and His resurrection is the hope of mankind.\"I've done a lot of speaking in Germany and in France, and in different parts of the world \u2014 105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in. And I was invited one day to visit Chancellor Adenauer, who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany, since the war. And he once \u2014 and he said to me, he said, \"Young man.\" He said, \"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?\" And I said, \"Sir, I do.\" He said, \"So do I.\" He said, \"When I leave office, I'm going to spend my time writing a book on why Jesus Christ rose again, and why it's so important to believe that.\" In one of his plays, Alexander Solzhenitsyn depicts a man dying, who says to those gathered around his bed, \"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.\" How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?Blaise Pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century France. Pascal has been called the architect of modern civilization. He was a brilliant scientist at the frontiers of mathematics, even as a teenager. He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory, and a creator of the first model of a computer. And of course, you are all familiar with the computer language named for him. Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas of evil, suffering and death. He was astounded at the phenomenon we've been considering: that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science, the arts and human enterprise, yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy and have \u2014 and self-hatreds. Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion. On November 23, 1654, Pascal had a profound religious experience. He wrote in his journal these words: \"I submit myself, absolutely, to Jesus Christ, my redeemer.\"A French historian said, two centuries later, \"Seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.\" Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony, but he believed that his own sins and failures could be forgiven, and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven. He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason. It was he who penned the well-known words, \"The heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of.\"Equally well known is Pascal's Wager. Essentially, he said this: \"if you bet on God, and open yourself to his love, you lose nothing, even if you're wrong. But if instead you bet that there is no God, then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.\" For Pascal, scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God. The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind. He was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39. King David lived to be 70, a long time in his era. Yet he too had to face death, and he wrote these words: \"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.\"This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil, suffering and death. It can be yours, as well, as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future. When I was 17 years of age, I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina. I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school. And there were 20 of them that I had \u2014 that I was responsible for, and I worked on the farm and tried to keep up with my studies. I didn't make good grades in high school. I didn't make them in college, until something happened in my heart.One day, I was faced face-to-face with Christ. He said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\" Can you imagine that? \"I am the truth. I'm the embodiment of all truth.\" He was a liar. Or he was insane. Or he was what he claimed to be. Which was he? I had to make that decision. I couldn't prove it. I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it. But by faith I said, I believe him, and he came into my heart and changed my life. And now I'm ready, when I hear that call, to go into the presence of God. Thank you, and God bless all of you.(Applause)Thank you for the privilege. It was great.Richard Wurman: You did it.

dramatic change\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthat made them a great power in the Near East.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nA man by the name of David\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\ncame to the throne,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand King David became one of the great leaders\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nof his generation.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nHe was a man of tremendous leadership.\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHe had the favor of God with him.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nHe was a brilliant poet,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nphilosopher, writer, soldier --\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nwith strategies in battle and conflict\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat people study even today.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nBut about two centuries before David,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthe Hittites\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nhad discovered the secret\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nof smelting and processing of iron,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand, slowly, that skill spread.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nBut they wouldn't allow the Israelis\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nto look into it, or to have any.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut David changed all of that,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand he introduced the Iron Age\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nto Israel.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nand which archaeologists have found,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nthat in present-day Palestine,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nthere are evidences of that generation.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nNow, instead of crude tools\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nmade of sticks and stones,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIsrael now had iron plows,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nand sickles, and hoes\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand military weapons.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nAnd in the course of one generation,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nIsrael was completely changed.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nThe introduction of iron, in some ways,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nhad an impact\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\na little bit like the microchip\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nhas had on our generation.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nDavid found\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat there were many problems that technology could not solve.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThere were many problems still left.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nAnd they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nand I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nHow do we solve these three problems\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat I'd like to mention?\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nThe first one that David saw\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nwas human evil.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhere does it come from?\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nHow do we solve it?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nOver again and again\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nin the Psalms,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhich Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nDavid describes the evils of the human race.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nAnd yet he says,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n\"He restores my soul.\"\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nHave you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nOn one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nand dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nas this conference vividly demonstrates.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe've seen under the sea,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthree miles down,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nor galaxies hundreds of billions of years\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nout in the future.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nBut on the other hand,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nsomething is wrong.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nOur battleships,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nour soldiers,\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nare on a frontier now,\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nalmost ready to go to war\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nwith Iraq.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nNow, what causes this?\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nWhy do we have these wars in every generation,\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nand in every part of the world?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nAnd revolutions?\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWe can't get along with other people,\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\neven in our own families.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWe find ourselves in the paralyzing grip\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nof self-destructive habits we can't break.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nRacism and injustice and violence sweep our world,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nbringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nEven the most sophisticated among us\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nseem powerless to break this cycle.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nI would like to see Oracle\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\ntake up that,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nor\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nsome other\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\ntechnological geniuses work on this.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nHow do we change man,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nso that he doesn't lie and cheat,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nand our newspapers are not filled with stories\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof fraud in business or labor\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nor athletics or wherever?\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe Bible says the problem is within us,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwithin our hearts and our souls.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nOur problem is that we are separated\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nfrom our Creator,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nwhich we call God,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nand we need to have our souls restored,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nsomething only God can do.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nJesus said, \"For out of the heart\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\ncome evil thoughts:\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nmurders, sexual immorality,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\ntheft, false testimonies,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nslander.\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nwas not a religious man,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nbut he said, \"It's in our hearts that the evil lies,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nand it's from our hearts\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthat it must be plucked out.\"\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAlbert Einstein --\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nI was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand I met\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nMr. Einstein.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nHe didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nnobody was qualified to give him one.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nBut he made this statement.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nHe said, \"It's easier to denature plutonium\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nthan to denature the evil spirit of man.\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd many of you, I'm sure,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nhave thought about that\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nand puzzled over it.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nYou've seen people\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\ntake beneficial technological advances,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nsuch as the Internet we've heard about tonight,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand twist them into something corrupting.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nYou've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat bring down whole systems.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThe Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nhorribly used.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThe problem is not technology.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nThe problem is the person or persons using it.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nKing David said\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat he knew the depths of his own soul.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nHe couldn't free himself from personal problems\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nand personal evils\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthat included murder and adultery.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYet King David sought God's forgiveness,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nand said, \"You can restore my soul.\"\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nYou see, the Bible teaches\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthat we're more than a body and a mind.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nWe are a soul.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd there's something inside of us\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat is beyond our understanding.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThat's the part of us that yearns\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nfor God, or something more\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nthan we find in technology.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nYour soul is that part of you that\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nyearns for meaning in life,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nand which seeks for something beyond this life.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIt's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI find [that] young people all over the world\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nare searching for something.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThey don't know what it is.

extraordinary heights\n\n00:21:42.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nin science, the arts and human enterprise,\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nyet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy\n\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:51.958\nand have -- and self-hatreds.\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nPascal saw us as a remarkable mixture\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:57.958\nof genius and self-delusion.\n\n00:21:57.958 --> 00:21:59.958\nOn November 23,\n\n00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.958\n1654,\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\nPascal had a profound religious experience.\n\n00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nHe wrote in his journal these words:\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.958\n\"I submit myself,\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:13.958\nabsolutely,\n\n00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nto Jesus Christ, my redeemer.\"\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nA French historian said,\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.958\ntwo centuries later,\n\n00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:24.958\n\"Seldom has so mighty an intellect\n\n00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:28.958\nsubmitted with such humility\n\n00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nto the authority of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nPascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:38.958\ncould bring us back into harmony,\n\n00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nbut he believed\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.958\nthat his own sins and failures could be forgiven,\n\n00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nand that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nHe experienced it in a way that went beyond\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nscientific observation and reason.\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.958\nIt was he who penned the well-known words,\n\n00:22:57.958 --> 00:22:59.958\n\"The heart has its reasons,\n\n00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:03.958\nwhich reason knows not of.\"\n\n00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.958\nEqually well known is Pascal's Wager.\n\n00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nEssentially, he said this: \"if you bet on God,\n\n00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.958\nand open yourself to his love,\n\n00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:15.958\nyou lose nothing, even if you're wrong.\n\n00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:18.958\nBut if instead you bet that there is no God,\n\n00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:22.958\nthen you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.\"\n\n00:23:24.958 --> 00:23:26.958\nFor Pascal, scientific knowledge\n\n00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:29.958\npaled beside the knowledge of God.\n\n00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:32.958\nThe knowledge of God was far beyond\n\n00:23:32.958 --> 00:23:35.958\nanything that ever crossed his mind.\n\n00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nHe was ready to face him\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\nwhen he died at the age of 39.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:42.958\nKing David lived to be 70,\n\n00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.958\na long time in his era.\n\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:48.958\nYet he too had to face death,\n\n00:23:48.958 --> 00:23:50.958\nand he wrote these words:\n\n00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:54.958\n\"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,\n\n00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nI will fear no evil,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.958\nfor you are with me.\"\n\n00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:01.958\nThis was David's answer to three dilemmas\n\n00:24:01.958 --> 00:24:04.958\nof evil, suffering and death.\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:07.958\nIt can be yours, as well,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:10.958\nas you seek the living God\n\n00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:12.958\nand allow him to fill your life\n\n00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:15.958\nand give you hope for the future.\n\n00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:19.958\nWhen I was 17 years of age,\n\n00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:24.958\nI was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:27.958\nI milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening\n\n00:24:27.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nwhen I came home from school.\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:31.958\nAnd there were 20 of them that I had --\n\n00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nthat I was responsible for,\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.958\nand I worked on the farm\n\n00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:40.958\nand tried to keep up with my studies.\n\n00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:43.958\nI didn't make good grades in high school.\n\n00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.958\nI didn't make them in college, until\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.958\nsomething happened in my heart.\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:51.958\nOne day, I was faced face-to-face\n\n00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.958\nwith Christ.\n\n00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:57.958\nHe said, \"I am the way, the truth and the life.\"\n\n00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:01.958\nCan you imagine that? \"I am the truth.\n\n00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:04.958\nI'm the embodiment of all truth.\"\n\n00:25:04.958 --> 00:25:06.958\nHe was a liar.\n\n00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:10.958\nOr he was insane.\n\n00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nOr he was what he claimed to be.\n\n00:25:13.958 --> 00:25:15.958\nWhich was he?\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.958\nI had to make that decision.\n\n00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.958\nI couldn't prove it.\n\n00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:21.958\nI couldn't take it to a laboratory\n\n00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:23.958\nand experiment with it.\n\n00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:26.958\nBut by faith I said, I believe him,\n\n00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:30.958\nand he came into my heart\n\n00:25:30.958 --> 00:25:32.958\nand changed my life.\n\n00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:35.958\nAnd now I'm ready,\n\n00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:37.958\nwhen I hear that call,\n\n00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:40.958\nto go into the presence of God.\n\n00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.958\nThank you, and God bless all of you.\n\n00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:52.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:25:53.958 --> 00:25:55.958\nThank you for the privilege. It was great.\n\n00:25:55.958 --> 00:25:57.958\nRichard Wurman: You did it.\n\n00:25:57.958 --> 00:25:58.958\nThanks.\n\n00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:14.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "My year of living biblically", "duration": "1060", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/a_j_jacobs_year_of_living_biblically", "transcript": "I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write. And I like to immerse myself in my topics. I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig. And I see my life as a series of experiments.So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago, I wrote an article called \"My Outsourced Life,\" where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India, to live my life for me. So, they answered my emails. They answered my phone. They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories. It was the best month of my life, because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies. It was a wonderful experience.More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called \u2014 about radical honesty. And this is a movement where \u2014 this is started by a psychologist in Virginia, who says that you should never, ever lie, except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions. And, more than that, whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth. So, I decided I would try this for a month. This was the worst month of my life. (Laughter) I do not recommend this at all. To give you a sense of the experience, the article was called, \"I Think You're Fat.\" (Laughter) So, that was hard.My most recent book \u2014 my previous book was called \"The Know-It-All,\" and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world, or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music, all the way to Zwyiec, which is \u2014 well, I don't want to ruin the ending. (Laughter) It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it. But I love that one, because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb. Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything. You can just Google it. So, I wasted some time there.I love those experiments, but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I've done is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible, \"The Year of Living Biblically.\" And I undertook this for two reasons. The first was that I grew up with no religion at all. As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. (Laughter) So, not very. But I've become increasingly interested in religion. I do think it's the defining issue of our time, or one of the main ones. And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him. So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.The second reason I undertook this is because I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism, and people who say they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls, as high as 45 or 50 percent of America. So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally? I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally, without picking and choosing.The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles. I had Christian bibles. I had Jewish bibles. A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible, where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, \"The Lord is all that,\" as opposed to what I knew it as, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\"Then I went down and I read several versions, and I wrote down every single law that I could find. And this was a very long list \u2014 over 700 rules. And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of \u2014 The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply. So I wanted to follow those. And actually, I take my projects very seriously, because I had twins during my year, so I definitely take my projects seriously.But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible. There is the law in Leviticus, \"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.\" I didn't know where my corners were, so I decided to let the whole thing grow, and this is what I looked like by the end. As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security. (Laughter) My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months. So, certainly the challenge was there.The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers, so I thought, \"Sounds strange, but I'll try it.\" You only know if you try it. I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts. The Bible says that if two men are in a fight, and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man, then her hand shall be cut off. So, I wanted to follow that rule. (Laughter) That one I followed by default, by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby, looking like she had a strong grip. (Laughter) So \u2014 oh, there's another shot of my beard.I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging. And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging. The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day. You know, I could spend a year not killing, but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying \u2014 you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist, so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress, because I couldn't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts. This was one of the huge lessons of the year, is that I almost pretended to be a better person, and I became a little bit of a better person. So I had always thought, you know, \"You change your mind, and you change your behavior,\" but it's often the other way around. You change your behavior, and you change your mind. So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate, you visit sick people in the hospital, and you will become more compassionate. You donate money to a cause, and you become emotionally involved in that cause. So, it really was cognitive psychology \u2014 you know, cognitive dissonance \u2014 that I was experiencing. The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology, very primitive cognitive psychology. In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier, which, as we know, is actually true.The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America. And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers. (Laughter) But it's a big part of the Bible, so I figured I had to address it. So, I was able to stone one adulterer. It happened \u2014 I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing, so sandals and sort of a white robe, you know, because again, the outer affects the inner. I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind. And this man came up to me and he said, \"Why are you dressed like that?\" And I explained my project, and he said, \"Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?\" And I said, \"Well, that would be great!\" (Laughter) And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks, hoping for just this interaction \u2014 and, you know, they were pebbles \u2014 but he grabbed them out of my hand. He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know. But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry. He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could \u2014 eye for an eye \u2014 I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues. How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places, and yet so incredibly wise in others? How should we view the Bible? Should we view it, you know, as original intent, like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible? How was the Bible written? And actually, since this is a tech crowd, I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years. And it's sort of evolved. It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons that I learned from my year. The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally. This became very, very clear, early on. Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person, and stoning adulterers, or \u2014 here's another example. Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding. (Laughter) It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.But this one is \u2014 the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat. And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around.So, you know, I met with creationists. I went to the creationists' museum. And these are the ultimate literalists. And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all. I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist. It's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model. And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous. They really did a fantastic job. If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes. So, whatever you think of creationism \u2014 and I think it's crazy \u2014 they did a great job. (Laughter)Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks. And this one was a big lesson because I was praying, giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic. But I was saying thanks all the time, every day, and I started to change my perspective. And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day, that I didn't even notice, that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong. So, this is actually a key to happiness for me, is to just remember when I came over here, the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs. It's a remarkable thing.Third, that thou shall have reverence. This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic, and by the end of the year, I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love. And I'm trying to start it as a movement. So, if anyone wants to join, the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God, there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness, and that our rituals can be sacred. The Sabbath can be sacred. This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath, because I am a workaholic, so having this one day where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life. So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.Thou shall not stereotype. This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey. I wanted it to be about religion in America. So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish. I'm very proud because I think I'm the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness. (Laughter) After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch, he's like, \"I gotta go.\" (Laughter) Oh, thank you very much. Thank you. Bless you, bless you.But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance, evangelical Christianity, and I found that it's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it. There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians, and they focus on the red words in the Bible, which are the ones that Jesus spoke. That's how they printed them in the old Bibles. And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality. They have a pamphlet that says, \"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,\" and you open it up, and there's nothing in it. So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts, helping poor people. So, this was very inspiring to me. I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo. They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree with much of what they say.Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational. This one was very unexpected because, you know, I grew up with the scientific worldview, and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces. And the thing is, if they're not harmful, they're not to be completely dismissed. Because I learned that \u2014 I was thinking, I was doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals, separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people \"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?\" And they said, \"We don't know, but it's just rituals that give us meaning.\" And I would say, \"But that's crazy.\" And they would say, \"Well, what about you? You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake. If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics, would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense, but that guy's crazy?'\" So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational. So the key is to choose the right rituals, the ones that are not harmful \u2014 but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed.And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose. And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible. And I failed miserably. Because you can't. You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing. The key is to pick and choose the right parts. There's the phrase called cafeteria religion, and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way, and they'll say, \"Oh, it's just cafeteria religion. You're just picking and choosing.\" But my argument is, \"What's wrong with cafeterias?\" I've had some great meals at cafeterias. I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave. So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion, about tolerance, about loving your neighbor, as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin, or intolerance, or violence, which are very much in the Bible as well. So if we are to find any meaning in this book, then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.And I thought I'd end with just a couple more. There's me reading the Bible. That's how I hailed taxicabs. (Laughter) Seriously, and it worked. And yes, that was actually a rented sheep, so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day. So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.", "id": 301, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd I like to immerse myself in my topics.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nAnd I see my life as a series of experiments.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nSo, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI wrote an article called \"My Outsourced Life,\"\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nwhere I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nto live my life for me.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo, they answered my emails.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThey answered my phone.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThey argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nIt was the best month of my life,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbecause I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nIt was a wonderful experience.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nMore recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nabout radical honesty.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd this is a movement where --\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthis is started by a psychologist in Virginia,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nwho says that you should never, ever lie,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nexcept maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nAnd, more than that, whatever is on your brain\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nshould come out of your mouth.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nSo, I decided I would try this for a month.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nThis was the worst month of my life.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nI do not recommend this at all.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nTo give you a sense of the experience,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthe article was called, \"I Think You're Fat.\"\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo, that was hard.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nMy most recent book -- my previous book was called \"The Know-It-All,\"\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nfrom A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nor more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nall the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nIt's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nBut I love that one,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbecause that was an experiment about how much information\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\none human brain could absorb.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAlthough, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nYou can just Google it.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, I wasted some time there.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nI love those experiments,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nbut I think that the most profound\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nand life-changing experiment that I've done\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nis my most recent experiment, where I spent a year\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\ntrying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\n\"The Year of Living Biblically.\"\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd I undertook this for two reasons.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nThe first was that I grew up with no religion at all.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAs I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthe Olive Garden is Italian.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nSo, not very.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nBut I've become increasingly interested in religion.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nI do think it's the defining issue of our time,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nor one of the main ones.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nSo, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThe second reason I undertook this is because\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nreligious fundamentalism, and people who say\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nthey take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nas high as 45 or 50 percent of America.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nSo I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI decided to take it to its logical conclusion\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nand take everything in the Bible literally,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nwithout picking and choosing.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThe first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nI had Christian bibles.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI had Jewish bibles.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nA friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwhere the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, \"The Lord is all that,\"\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nas opposed to what I knew it as, \"The Lord is my shepherd.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nThen I went down and I read several versions,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nand I wrote down every single law that I could find.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThe Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nSo I wanted to follow those.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd actually, I take my projects very seriously,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nbecause I had twins during my year,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nso I definitely take my projects seriously.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut I also wanted to follow the hundreds\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nof arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nThere is the law in Leviticus,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\n\"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nI didn't know where my corners were,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nso I decided to let the whole thing grow,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nand this is what I looked like by the end.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAs you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nMy wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nSo, certainly the challenge was there.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nso I thought, \"Sounds strange, but I'll try it.\"\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nYou only know if you try it.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nI got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nThe Bible says that if two men are in a fight,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nand the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthen her hand shall be cut off.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nSo, I wanted to follow that rule.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThat one I followed by default,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nby not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nlooking like she had a strong grip.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nI will say it was an amazing year\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nbecause it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nAnd there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThe first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nYou know, I could spend a year not killing,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nbut spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nyou know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nso this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nBut it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbecause I couldn't believe how much\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nmy behavior changed my thoughts.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThis was one of the huge lessons of the year,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nis that I almost pretended to be a better person,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nand I became a little bit of a better person.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo I had always thought, you know, \"You change your mind,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nand you change your behavior,\" but it's often the other way around.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nYou change your behavior, and you change your mind.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nyou visit sick people in the hospital,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand you will become more compassionate.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nYou donate money to a cause,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand you become emotionally involved in that cause.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, it really was cognitive psychology --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nyou know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThe Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nvery primitive cognitive psychology.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIn the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nwhich, as we know, is actually true.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThe second type of rule that was difficult to obey\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwas the rules that will get you into a little trouble\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nin twenty-first-century America.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nAnd perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:31.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nBut it's a big part of the Bible,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nso I figured I had to address it.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nSo, I was able to stone one adulterer.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nIt happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nso sandals and sort of a white robe,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nyou know, because again, the outer affects the inner.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nI wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd this man came up to me and he said,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n\"Why are you dressed like that?\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd I explained my project,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nand he said, \"Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?\"\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, that would be great!\"\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nthat I had been carrying around for weeks,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nhoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbut he grabbed them out of my hand.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nHe was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nBut he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nHe grabbed them out of my hand\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\neye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nSo that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nto talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHow can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand yet so incredibly wise in others?\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nHow should we view the Bible?\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nShould we view it, you know, as original intent,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nlike a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nHow was the Bible written?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd actually, since this is a tech crowd,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nI talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nof the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nover hundreds of years.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd it's sort of evolved.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nIt's not a book that was written and came down from on high.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nSo I thought I would end by telling you\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\njust a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nthat I learned from my year.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis became very, very clear, early on.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nBecause if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nand stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nIt's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nBut this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nduring certain times of the month, and more than that,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nyou cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd my wife thought this was very offensive,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nso she sat in every seat in our apartment,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand I had to spend much of the year standing\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nuntil I bought my own seat and carried it around.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nSo, you know, I met with creationists.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nI went to the creationists' museum.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd these are the ultimate literalists.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nAnd it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nI would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nIt's just that their faith is so strong\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nin this literal interpretation of the Bible\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nthat they distort all the data to fit their model.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nThey really did a fantastic job.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nIf you're ever in Kentucky,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthere's, you can see a movie of the flood,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nand they have sprinklers in the ceiling\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nSo, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthey did a great job.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnother lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd this one was a big lesson because I was praying,\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ngiving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nBut I was saying thanks all the time, every day,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand I started to change my perspective.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd I started to realize the hundreds of little things\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nthat go right every day, that I didn't even notice,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthat I took for granted, as opposed to focusing\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\non the three or four that went wrong.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nSo, this is actually a key to happiness for me,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nis to just remember when I came over here,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthe car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt's a remarkable thing.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThird, that thou shall have reverence.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nThis one was unexpected because I started the year\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nas an agnostic, and by the end of the year,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nI became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd I'm trying to start it as a movement.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo, if anyone wants to join,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nthe basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nthere's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand that our rituals can be sacred.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe Sabbath can be sacred.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nThis was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause I am a workaholic, so having this one day\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nwhere you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThou shall not stereotype.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThis one happened because\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nI spent a lot of time with various religious communities\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nthroughout America because I wanted it to be more\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nthan about my journey.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nI wanted it to be about religion in America.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nI'm very proud because\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nI think I'm the only person in America\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nto out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nAfter three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nhe's like, \"I gotta go.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nOh, thank you very much.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nThank you. Bless you, bless you.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBut it was interesting\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nbecause I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nevangelical Christianity, and I found that\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nit's such a wide and varied movement\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat it is difficult to make generalizations about it.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThere's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nand they focus on the red words in the Bible,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nwhich are the ones that Jesus spoke.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nThat's how they printed them in the old Bibles.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nAnd their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nThey have a pamphlet that says,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\n\"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,\"\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand you open it up, and there's nothing in it.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nSo, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nhelping poor people.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nSo, this was very inspiring to me.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nI recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nThey're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nwith much of what they say.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAlso, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nThis one was very unexpected because, you know,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nI grew up with the scientific worldview,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand I was shocked learning how much of my life\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nis governed by irrational forces.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nAnd the thing is, if they're not harmful,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nthey're not to be completely dismissed.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nBecause I learned that -- I was thinking, I was\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\ndoing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nseparating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\n\"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?\"\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nAnd they said, \"We don't know,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nbut it's just rituals that give us meaning.\"\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I would say, \"But that's crazy.\"\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd they would say, \"Well, what about you?\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nYou blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nIf a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nblowing out the fire on top of a cake\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nversus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nwould the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nbut that guy's crazy?'\"\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nSo no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nSo the key is to choose the right rituals,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nthe ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nare not to be dismissed.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nAnd this one I learned because\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI tried to follow everything in the Bible.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nAnd I failed miserably.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nBecause you can't.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nYou have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nis going to be picking and choosing.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nThe key is to pick and choose the right parts.\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThere's the phrase called cafeteria religion,\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nand the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand they'll say, \"Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nYou're just picking and choosing.\"\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nBut my argument is, \"What's wrong with cafeterias?\"\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nI've had some great meals at cafeterias.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nI've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nSo, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nabout tolerance, about loving your neighbor,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nas opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nor intolerance, or violence,\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwhich are very much in the Bible as well.\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo if we are to find any meaning in this book,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthen we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd I thought I'd end with just a couple more.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nThere's me reading the Bible.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nThat's how I hailed taxicabs.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSeriously, and it worked. And yes,\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nthat was actually a rented sheep,\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nso I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nSo, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak."}, {"title": "Brain magic", "duration": "1189", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/keith_barry_does_brain_magic", "transcript": "Brain magic. What's brain magic all about? Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects. So unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words, linguistic deception, non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.I'm going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how. I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody. I want everybody to put out your hands like this for me, first of all. OK, clap them together, once. OK, reverse your hands. Now, follow my actions exactly. Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that? OK, swap them around, put your right hand up. Cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over, interlace your fingers like this, then make sure your right thumb is outside your left thumb \u2014 that's very important. Yours is the other way around, so swap it around. Excellent, OK. Extend your fingers like this for me. All right. Tap them together once. OK, now, if you did not allow me to deceive your minds, you would all be able to do this.(Laughter)(Laughter ends)Now you can see how easy it is for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.(Laughter)Now, I remember when I was about 15,(Laughter)I read a copy of Life magazine, which detailed a story about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman who could sense printed letters \u2014 there's still people trying to do it \u2014(Laughter)\u2014 who could sense printed letters and even sense colors, just by touch. And she was completely blind. She could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed, face down, on a hard surface. Now, I was fascinated, but at the same time, skeptical. How could somebody read using their fingertips? You know, if you actually think about it, if somebody is totally blind \u2014 a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms, where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things. And it's just a really weird thing to try and figure out. How could somebody read using their fingertips?Now earlier on, as part of a TV show that I have coming up on MTV, I attempted to give a similar demonstration of what is now known as second sight. So, let's take a look.(Video) Man: There we go. I'm going to guide you into the car.Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter)Man: You're OK, keep on going.KT: How are you?Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here. I'm going to take you to a secret location, OK? Kathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.KT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?KT: Yes.KB: No way to see through it? KT: No.KB: I'll take it off. Do you want to take the rest off? Take it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second.KT: I'm so afraid of what I'm going to see.KB: You're fine, take it off. You're OK. You're safe. Have you ever heard of second sight?KT: No.KB: Second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else's eyes. And I'm going to try that right now.KT: God.KB: Are you ready? Where is it? There's no way \u2014KT: (Beep)KT: Oh, my God!KB: Don't say anything, I'm trying to see through your eyes. I can't see.KT: There's a wall, there's a wall.KB: Look at the road, look at the road.KT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God!KB: Now, anything coming at all? KT: No.KB: Sure there's not?KT: No, no, I'm just still looking at the road. I'm looking at the road, all the time. I'm not taking my eyes off the road.(Beep)(Beep)(Beep)KT: Oh, my God!KB: Where are we? Where are we? We're going uphill, are we going uphill?KT: Look at the road \u2014 (Beep) Still got that goddamn blindfold on.KB: What?KT: How are you doing this?KB: Just don't break my concentration.We're OK, though? KT: Yes. That's so weird. We're nearly there. Oh, my God!Oh, my God!KB: And I've stopped.KT: That is weird. You're like a freak-ass of nature. That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life!(Applause)KB: Thank you. By the way, two days ago, we were going to film this down there, at the race course, and we got a guy into a car, and we got a camera man in the back, but halfway through the drive, he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter, stuck to his leg. So, I stopped pretty quick, and that was it.So, do you believe it's possible to see through somebody else's eyes? That's the question. Now, most people here would automatically say no. OK, but I want you to realize some facts. I couldn't see through the blindfold. The car was not gimmicked or tricked in any way. The girl, I'd never met before, all right. So, I want you to just think about it for a moment. A lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened, all right. But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.This is because magic is all about directing attention. If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it. But if I wanted you to look at my right hand, then I look at it, too. You see, it's very simple, once you know how, but very complicated in other ways.I'm going to give you some demonstrations right now. I need two people to help me out real quick. Can you come up? And let's see, down at the end, here, can you also come up, real quick? Do you mind? Yes, at the end. OK, give them a round of applause as they come up. You might want to use the stairs, there.(Applause)It's very important for everybody here to realize I haven't set anything up with you. You don't know what will happen, right? Would you mind just standing over here for a moment?Your name is? Nicole: Nicole.KB: Nicole, and?(Telephone ringing)KB: Actually, here's the thing, answer it, answer it, answer it.(Laughter)Is it a girl? Man: They've already gone.KB: OK, swap over positions. Can you stand over here? This will make it easier. Pity, I would have told them it was the ace of spades. OK, a little bit closer.(Laughter)OK, a little bit closer, come over \u2014 they look really nervous up here. Do you believe in witchcraft?Nicole: No.KB: Voodoo? Nicole: No.KB: Things that go bump in the night? Nicole: No.KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK. I want you to just stand exactly like this for me, pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind. OK, now, I want you to be aware of all the different sensations around you, because we'll try a voodoo experiment. I want you to be aware of the sensations, but don't say anything until I ask you, and don't open your eyes until I ask you. From this point onwards, close your eyes, do not say anything, do not open them, be aware of the sensations.Yes or no, did you feel anything?Nicole: Yes.KB: You did feel that? What did you feel?Nicole: A touch on my back.KB: How many times did you feel it?Nicole: Twice.KB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm out in front of you. Extend your left arm, OK. OK, keep it there. Be aware of the sensations, don't say anything, don't open your eyes, OK.Did you feel anything, there?Nicole: Yes. KB: What did you feel?Nicole: Three \u2014KB: Like a tickling sensation? Nicole: Yes.KB: Can you show us where? OK, excellent. Open your eyes. I never touched you. I just touched his back, and I just touched his arm. A voodoo experiment.(Laughter)Yeah, I walk around nightclubs all night like this.(Laughter)You just take a seat over here for a second. I'm going to use you again, in a moment. Can you take a seat right over here, if you don't mind.Sit right here. Man: OK.KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK. Now, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK, just take a deep breath in through your nose, letting it out through your mouth, and relax. Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one. Close your eyes right now. OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines. And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.I want you to hold it there just for a moment, and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness, and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop. That's it, all the way down, all the way down. and further, and further. Excellent. I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop. OK, now, allow it to stay there.OK, now, in a moment, you'll feel a certain pressure, OK, and I want you to be aware of the pressure. Just be aware of the pressure. And I only want you to allow your hand to float slowly back up from the tabletop as you feel the pressure release, but only when you feel the pressure release. Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.Man: Yes.KB: Hold it right there. And only when you feel the pressure go back, allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop, but only when you feel the pressure.(Laughter)OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting. Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed. Can you stand up? Just stand, stage forward. I want you to point directly at his forehead. OK. Imagine a connection between you and him. Only when you want the pressure to be released, make an upward gesture, like this, but only when you want it to be released. You can wait as long as you want, but only when you want the pressure released. OK, let's try it again. OK, now, imagine the connection, OK. Point directly at his forehead. Only when you want the pressure released, we'll try it again.OK, it worked that time, excellent. And hold it there, both of you. Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture. You can wait as long as you want. You did it pretty quickly, but it went down, OK.Now, I want you to be aware that in a moment, when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again. It's OK to remember to forget, or forget to remember what happened. Most people ask you, \"What the hell just happened up here?\" But it's OK that even though you're not hypnotized, you will forget everything that happened. On five, four, three, two, one \u2014 open your eyes, wide awake. Give them a round of applause, as they go back to their seats.(Applause)OK, you can go back.(Applause)I once saw a film called \"The Gods Are Crazy.\" Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah. Remember when they threw the Coke out of the airplane, and it landed on the ground, and it didn't break? Now, see, that's because Coke bottles are solid. It's nearly impossible to break a Coke bottle. Do you want to try it? Good job. She's not taking any chances.(Laughter)You see, psychokinesis is the paranormal influence of the mind on physical events and processes. For some magicians or mentalists, sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not. Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not. It depends on how much energy you have that day, so on and so forth.We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now. Come right over here, next to me. Excellent. Now, have a look at the Coke bottle. Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle. And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful. Even though it's solid, I'm standing away. I want you to pinch right here with two fingers and your thumb. Excellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK. I want you to examine the shard of glass. Careful, it's sharp. Just hold on to it for a moment. Now, hold it out here.I want you to imagine, right now, a broken relationship from many years ago. I want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship, from that guy, being imparted into the broken piece of glass, which will represent him, OK. But I want you to take this very seriously. Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here. In a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK, and when you feel that sensation, I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle. Think of that guy, that ba \u2014 that guy.(Laughter)I'm trying to be good here. OK, and when you feel the sensation \u2014 it might take a while \u2014 drop it into the glass. OK, drop it in.Now, imagine all that negative energy in there. Imagine his name and imagine him inside the glass. And I want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side.(Burst)(Laughter)That was a lot of negative energy, built up in there.(Laughter)(Applause)I also want you to look at me and think of his name. OK, think of how many letters in the title of his name. There's five letters in the title. You didn't react to that, so it's four letters. Think of one of the letters in the title. There's a K in his name, there is a K. I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M. Tell Mike I said hello, the next time you see him.Was that his name? Nicole: Mm-hmm.KB: OK, give her a round of applause.(Applause)Thank you.(Applause)(Applause ends)I've got one more thing to share with you right now. Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment? And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.KB: I was going to use you, but I decided I might want to come back another year.(Laughter)CA: Well, to reward him for saying \"eureka,\" and for selecting Michael Mercil to come and talk to us \u2014 Steve Jurvetson.KB: OK, Steve, come on up here.(Applause)CA: You knew!KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take a seat, right behind here. Excellent. Now, Steve \u2014 oh, you can check underneath. Go ahead, I've no fancy assistants underneath there. They insist that because I was a magician, put a nice, black tablecloth on. There you are, OK.(Laughter)I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve. One, two, three and four. Now, they're all the exact same except this one obviously has a stainless steel spike sticking out of it. I want you to examine it, and make sure it's solid. Happy?Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going to stand in front of the table, When I stand in front of the table, I want you to put the cups on the plinths, in any order you want, and then mix them all up, so nobody has any idea where the spike is, all right?SJ: No one in the audience?KB: Yes, and just to help you out, I'll block them from view, so nobody can see what you're doing. I'll also look away. So, go ahead and mix them up, now. OK, and tell me when you're done.(Laughter)(Laughter)KB: You done? SJ: Almost.KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making sure that's well hidden. Oh, we've got one here, we've got one here.(Applause)So, all right, we'll leave them like that.(Laughter)I'm going to have the last laugh, though.(Laughter)Now, Steve, you know where the spike is, but nobody else, does? Correct? But I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair. They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny. No, stay around, OK. Now, Steve, look back. Now you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either. Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold?SJ: Put this on?KB: No, just, is there any way to see through it? No?SJ: No, I can't see through it. KB: Excellent. Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold. Don't stack them up, OK. Give them an extra mix up. Don't move the cups, I don't want anybody to see where the spike is, but give the plinths an extra mix up, and then line them up. I'll put the blindfold on. Give them an extra mix up. No messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up. My hand is at risk here.(Laughter)Tell me when you're done. SJ: Done.KB: OK, where are you? Put out your hand. Your right hand. Tell me when I'm over a cup.SJ: You're over a cup. KB: I'm over a cup, right now?SJ: Mm-hmm.KB: Now, Steve, do you think it's here? Yes or no?SJ: Oh!(Laughter)KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.(Laughter)SJ: I don't think it's there. KB: No? Good decision.(Laughter)(Applause)(Applause ends)Now, if I go this way, is there another cup over here?SJ: Can we do the left hand?KB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could he do the left hand. Absolutely not.(Laughter)KB: If I go this way, is there another cup?SJ: Yes. KB: Tell me when to stop.SJ: OK. KB: There?SJ: Yes, there's one.KB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no? This is your decision, not mine.(Laughter)SJ: I'm going to say no. KB: Good decision.(Laughter)OK, give me both hands. Now, put them on both cups. Do you think the spike is under your left or your right hand?SJ: Neither.KB: Neither, oh, OK. But if you were to guess.(Laughter)SJ: Under my right hand. KB: Under your right hand? Now, remember, you made all the decisions all along. Psychologists, figure this out.(SJ gasps)Have a look.SJ: Oh!(Applause)KB: Thank you.(Applause ends) If anybody wants to see some sleight of hand later on, I'll be outside. Thank you.(Applause)Thank you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 310, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.958\nBrain magic.

And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I'm going to be talking about today, which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic. The editor of Discover told us 10 of them; I'm going to give you the eleventh.So they came to me, CNN, and they said, \"Professor Seligman \u2014 would you tell us about the state of psychology today? We'd like to interview you about that.\" And I said, \"Great.\" And she said, \"But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite.\" I said, \"Well, how many words do I get?\" And she said, \"Well, one.\"(Laughter)And the cameras rolled, and she said, \"Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Good.\"(Laughter)\"Cut! Cut. That won't do. We'd really better give you a longer sound bite.\" \"How many words do I get this time?\" \"Well, you get two.\"(Laughter)\"Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Not good.\"(Laughter)\"Look, Doctor Seligman, we can see you're really not comfortable in this medium. We'd better give you a real sound bite. This time you can have three words. Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?\" \"Not good enough.\" That's what I'm going to be talking about.I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good, and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough. And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.So, why was psychology good? Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model. Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did, they'd move away from me, because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you. Spot the loony. And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.What was good about psychology \u2014 about the $30 billion investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology \u2014 is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable; it was entirely smoke and mirrors. And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness. We found out we could take fuzzy concepts like depression, alcoholism, and measure them with rigor; that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses; that we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses. We could look across time at the same people \u2014 people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia \u2014 and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments. And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.The conclusion of that is, psychology and psychiatry of the last 60 years can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable. And I think that's terrific. I'm proud of it. But what was not good, the consequences of that, were three things.The first was moral; that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers; that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive. And \"genius,\" \"high-talent,\" became a dirty word. No one works on that.And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier \u2014 positive interventions.So that was not good. And so that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call, \"positive psychology,\" which has three aims. The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness. It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage. It should be interested in the best things in life. And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living. It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness. And any of you, for free, can go to that website \u2014[www.authentichappiness.org]and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness. You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people? We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities: a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio, how they're defined, how to diagnose them, what builds them and what gets in their way. We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity, as a cause of happiness.I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question: How do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you? And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people. How do they differ from the rest of us? It turns out there's one way, very surprising \u2014 they're not more religious, they're not in better shape, they don't have more money, they're not better looking, they don't have more good events and fewer bad events. The one way in which they differ: they're extremely social. They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.(Laughter)They don't spend time alone. Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends.But watch out here \u2014 this is merely correlational data, not causal, and it's about happiness in the first, \"Hollywood\" sense, I'm going to talk about, happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer. And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment. We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries, from the Buddha to Tony Robbins. About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy. And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random-assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies. That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier? In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is, can psychology actually make people happier? And to ask that question \u2014 \"happy\" is not a word I use very much \u2014 we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about \"happy.\" And I believe there are three different \u2014 I call them \"different\" because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other \u2014 three different happy lives. The first happy life is the pleasant life. This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it. The second is a life of engagement: a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure; time stops for you. That's what Aristotle was talking about. And third, the meaningful life. I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.The first life is the pleasant life, and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills \u2014 savoring, mindfulness \u2014 that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space. But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology, and why it doesn't end here.The first drawback is, it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable. So the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it. Second is that positive emotion habituates. It habituates rapidly, indeed. It's all like French vanilla ice cream: the first taste is 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone. And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.And this leads to the second life. I have to tell you about my friend Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure. In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful. The first arena was work. By the time he was 20, he was an options trader. By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company. Second, in play, he's a national champion bridge player. But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure. And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.(Laughter)Len is an introvert. American women said to Len, when he dated them, \"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost.\" And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him. But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma. It turned out that \u2014 Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge. Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.The question is: Is Len unhappy? And I want to say, not. Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know. He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness, and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow. When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning, time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell. When the first card is played till 10 days later, when the tournament is over, time stops for Len.And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way: pleasure has raw feel \u2014 you know it's happening; it's thought and feeling. But what Mike told you yesterday \u2014 during flow ... you can't feel anything. You're one with the music. Time stops. You have intense concentration. And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life. And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are \u2014 again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are \u2014 and then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can. Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.Just one example. One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's. Hated the job. She's working her way through college. Her highest strength was social intelligence. So she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day. Now, obviously she failed. But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible. What you get out of that is not smiley-ness. You don't look like Debbie Reynolds. You don't giggle a lot. What you get is more absorption.So, that's the second path. The first path, positive emotion; the second path is eudaemonian flow; and the third path is meaning. This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally. And meaning, in this view, consists of \u2014 very parallel to eudaemonia \u2014 it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives \u2014 the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life \u2014 people are now hard at work on the question: Are there things that lastingly change those lives? And the answer seems to be yes. And I'll just give you some samples of it. It's being done in a rigorous manner. It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works. So we do random-assignment, placebo-controlled, long-term studies of different interventions. Just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect: when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day. Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures. And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.Gratitude visit. I want you all to do this with me now, if you would. Close your eyes. I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked. The person has to be alive. Now, OK, you can open your eyes. I hope all of you have such a person. Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why. Show up at their door, you read the testimonial \u2014 everyone weeps when this happens. And what happens is, when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.Another example is a strengths date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths. We find this is a strengthener of relationships. And fun versus philanthropy. It's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy. Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and contrast it. And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set. When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts. So those are examples of positive interventions.So the next to last thing I want to say is: we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have. This is really what you're about. And that's our target variable. And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get? So we ask \u2014 and we've done this in 15 replications, involving thousands of people: To what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?And our results surprised us; they were backward of what we thought. It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction. The pursuit of meaning is the strongest. The pursuit of engagement is also very strong. Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry. Which is to say, the full life \u2014 the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three. Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.And what we're asking now is: Does the very same relationship \u2014 physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity \u2014 follow the same relationship? That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning? Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life? And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me. I've never been in a gathering like this. I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things. But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way: we all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes. We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery. And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important. I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy. And I never found that; I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero; that they were empty.And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery. And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe. That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion. And that's typically how they've been used. But once you fractionate happiness the way I do \u2014 not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough \u2014 there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life. As Laura Lee told us, design and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet. And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough. If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning eudaemonia, it will be good enough. And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaemonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 312, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:15.474\nWhen I was President of the American\nPsychological Association,\n\n00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.124\nthey tried to media-train me.\n\n00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:22.711\nAnd an encounter I had with CNN summarizes\n\n00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:24.836\nwhat I'm going to be talking about today,\n\n00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.934\nwhich is the eleventh reason\nto be optimistic.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:33.134\nThe editor of Discover told us 10 of them;\n\n00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.252\nI'm going to give you the eleventh.\n\n00:00:36.276 --> 00:00:40.035\nSo they came to me, CNN,\nand they said, \"Professor Seligman --\n\n00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.721\nwould you tell us about the state\nof psychology today?\n\n00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.662\nWe'd like to interview you about that.\"\n\n00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.900\nAnd I said, \"Great.\"\n\n00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.257\nAnd she said, \"But this is CNN,\nso you only get a sound bite.\"\n\n00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.735\nI said, \"Well, how many words do I get?\"\n\n00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:58.142\nAnd she said, \"Well, one.\"\n\n00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.522\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.315\nAnd the cameras rolled, and she said,\n\n00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.656\n\"Professor Seligman,\nwhat is the state of psychology today?\"\n\n00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:08.345\n\"Good.\"\n\n00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.497\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.521\n\"Cut!

treatable;\n\n00:03:00.853 --> 00:03:02.765\nit was entirely smoke and mirrors.\n\n00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.252\nAnd now, 14 of the disorders\nare treatable,\n\n00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:07.180\ntwo of them actually curable.\n\n00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.414\nAnd the other thing that happened\nis that a science developed,\n\n00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:14.366\na science of mental illness.\n\n00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.166\nWe found out we could take fuzzy concepts\n\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.170\nlike depression, alcoholism,\n\n00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:23.785\nand measure them with rigor;\n\n00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:28.056\nthat we could create a classification\nof the mental illnesses;\n\n00:03:28.402 --> 00:03:33.083\nthat we could understand\nthe causality of the mental illnesses.\n\n00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:36.934\nWe could look across time\nat the same people --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.935\npeople, for example, who were genetically\nvulnerable to schizophrenia --\n\n00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.171\nand ask what the contribution\nof mothering, of genetics are,\n\n00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.559\nand we could isolate third variables\n\n00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:50.934\nby doing experiments\non the mental illnesses.\n\n00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:54.949\nAnd best of all, we were able,\nin the last 50 years,\n\n00:03:54.973 --> 00:03:58.802\nto invent drug treatments\nand psychological treatments.\n\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.934\nAnd then we were able\nto test them rigorously,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.251\nin random-assignment,\nplacebo-controlled designs,\n\n00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:08.527\nthrow out the things that didn't work,\n\n00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.275\nkeep the things that actively did.\n\n00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:13.817\nThe conclusion of that is,\n\n00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.934\npsychology and psychiatry\nof the last 60 years\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:22.111\ncan actually claim that we can make\nmiserable people less miserable.\n\n00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.768\nAnd I think that's terrific.\n\n00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.178\nI'm proud of it.\n\n00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.359\nBut what was not good,\nthe consequences of that,\n\n00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.889\nwere three things.\n\n00:04:34.913 --> 00:04:36.691\nThe first was moral;\n\n00:04:36.715 --> 00:04:41.509\nthat psychologists and psychiatrists\nbecame victimologists, pathologizers;\n\n00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.575\nthat our view of human nature\nwas that if you were in trouble,\n\n00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:45.996\nbricks fell on you.\n\n00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.113\nAnd we forgot that people\nmade choices and decisions.\n\n00:04:49.137 --> 00:04:50.635\nWe forgot responsibility.\n\n00:04:51.026 --> 00:04:52.701\nThat was the first cost.\n\n00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:56.934\nThe second cost was\nthat we forgot about you people.\n\n00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.034\nWe forgot about improving normal lives.\n\n00:05:01.058 --> 00:05:06.934\nWe forgot about a mission to make\nrelatively untroubled people happier,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.738\nmore fulfilled, more productive.\n\n00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:13.068\nAnd \"genius,\" \"high-talent,\"\nbecame a dirty word.\n\n00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.021\nNo one works on that.\n\n00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.934\nAnd the third problem\nabout the disease model is,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.239\nin our rush to do something\nabout people in trouble,\n\n00:05:22.263 --> 00:05:25.979\nin our rush to do something\nabout repairing damage,\n\n00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:30.006\nit never occurred to us\nto develop interventions\n\n00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.789\nto make people happier --\npositive interventions.\n\n00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.134\nSo that was not good.\n\n00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:40.987\nAnd so that's what led people\nlike Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,\n\n00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:42.920\nMike Csikszentmihalyi and myself\n\n00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.804\nto work in something I call,\n\"positive psychology,\"\n\n00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:47.240\nwhich has three aims.\n\n00:05:47.637 --> 00:05:52.523\nThe first is that psychology\nshould be just as concerned\n\n00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:55.263\nwith human strength\nas it is with weakness.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.604\nIt should be just as concerned\nwith building strength\n\n00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.766\nas with repairing damage.\n\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.473\nIt should be interested\nin the best things in life.\n\n00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.371\nAnd it should be just as concerned\n\n00:06:07.395 --> 00:06:11.108\nwith making the lives\nof normal people fulfilling,\n\n00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:15.081\nand with genius,\nwith nurturing high talent.\n\n00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:20.509\nSo in the last 10 years\nand the hope for the future,\n\n00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:23.934\nwe've seen the beginnings\nof a science of positive psychology,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.133\na science of what makes life worth living.\n\n00:06:26.497 --> 00:06:31.042\nIt turns out that we can measure\ndifferent forms of happiness.\n\n00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:34.546\nAnd any of you, for free,\ncan go to that website --\n\n00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.961\n[www.authentichappiness.org]\n\n00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:38.464\nand take the entire panoply\nof tests of happiness.\n\n00:06:38.488 --> 00:06:42.934\nYou can ask, how do you stack\nup for positive emotion, for meaning,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:46.986\nfor flow, against literally tens\nof thousands of other people?\n\n00:06:47.676 --> 00:06:52.934\nWe created the opposite of the diagnostic\nmanual of the insanities:\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.179\na classification of the strengths\nand virtues that looks at the sex ratio,\n\n00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:00.409\nhow they're defined, how to diagnose them,\n\n00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:03.251\nwhat builds them\nand what gets in their way.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.397\nWe found that we could discover\nthe causation of the positive states,\n\n00:07:09.421 --> 00:07:12.934\nthe relationship between left\nhemispheric activity\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nand right hemispheric activity,\nas a cause of happiness.\n\n00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.435\nI've spent my life working\non extremely miserable people,\n\n00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:24.846\nand I've asked the question:\n\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.523\nHow do extremely miserable people\ndiffer from the rest of you?\n\n00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:32.934\nAnd starting about six years ago,\nwe asked about extremely happy people.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.498\nHow do they differ from the rest of us?\n\n00:07:35.522 --> 00:07:39.005\nIt turns out there's one way,\nvery surprising --\n\n00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:41.697\nthey're not more religious,\nthey're not in better shape,\n\n00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:44.809\nthey don't have more money,\nthey're not better looking,\n\n00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:47.588\nthey don't have more good events\nand fewer bad events.\n\n00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:51.000\nThe one way in which they differ:\nthey're extremely social.\n\n00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.463\nThey don't sit in seminars\non Saturday morning.\n\n00:07:55.487 --> 00:07:59.442\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.435\nThey don't spend time alone.\n\n00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:03.657\nEach of them is in a romantic relationship\n\n00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.829\nand each has a rich repertoire of friends.\n\n00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:11.230\nBut watch out here -- this is merely\ncorrelational data, not causal,\n\n00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:14.852\nand it's about happiness\nin the first, \"Hollywood\" sense,\n\n00:08:14.876 --> 00:08:16.088\nI'm going to talk about,\n\n00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:20.278\nhappiness of ebullience\nand giggling and good cheer.\n\n00:08:20.302 --> 00:08:23.137\nAnd I'm going to suggest to you\nthat's not nearly enough,\n\n00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:24.311\nin just a moment.\n\n00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:29.763\nWe found we could begin to look\nat interventions over the centuries,\n\n00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:31.580\nfrom the Buddha to Tony Robbins.\n\n00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:36.387\nAbout 120 interventions have been proposed\nthat allegedly make people happy.\n\n00:08:36.814 --> 00:08:41.436\nAnd we find that we've been able\nto manualize many of them,\n\n00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.379\nand we actually carry out\n\n00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:47.045\nrandom-assignment efficacy\nand effectiveness studies.\n\n00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.225\nThat is, which ones actually\nmake people lastingly happier?\n\n00:08:51.249 --> 00:08:54.476\nIn a couple of minutes, I'll tell you\nabout some of those results.\n\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.934\nBut the upshot of this is that the mission\nI want psychology to have,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.445\nin addition to its mission\nof curing the mentally ill,\n\n00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:08.743\nand in addition to its mission of making\nmiserable people less miserable,\n\n00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:12.338\nis, can psychology actually\nmake people happier?\n\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.866\nAnd to ask that question -- \"happy\"\nis not a word I use very much --\n\n00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:18.806\nwe've had to break it down\n\n00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.362\ninto what I think\nis askable about \"happy.\"\n\n00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:24.372\nAnd I believe there are three different --\n\n00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:28.420\nI call them \"different\" because different\ninterventions build them,\n\n00:09:28.444 --> 00:09:30.845\nit's possible to have one\nrather than the other --\n\n00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:32.846\nthree different happy lives.\n\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.987\nThe first happy life is the pleasant life.\n\n00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:39.396\nThis is a life in which you have\nas much positive emotion\n\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.934\nas you possibly can,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.059\nand the skills to amplify it.\n\n00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.263\nThe second is a life of engagement:\n\n00:09:45.287 --> 00:09:50.652\na life in your work, your parenting,\nyour love, your leisure;\n\n00:09:50.676 --> 00:09:51.982\ntime stops for you.\n\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.148\nThat's what Aristotle was talking about.\n\n00:09:55.172 --> 00:09:57.239\nAnd third, the meaningful life.\n\n00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:59.934\nI want to say a little bit\nabout each of those lives\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.775\nand what we know about them.\n\n00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:06.777\nThe first life is the pleasant life,\nand it's simply, as best we can find it,\n\n00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:09.088\nit's having as many\nof the pleasures as you can,\n\n00:10:09.112 --> 00:10:11.221\nas much positive emotion as you can,\n\n00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:17.733\nand learning the skills -- savoring,\nmindfulness -- that amplify them,\n\n00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:20.934\nthat stretch them over time and space.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:24.934\nBut the pleasant life has three drawbacks,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.466\nand it's why positive psychology\nis not happy-ology,\n\n00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.367\nand why it doesn't end here.\n\n00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.934\nThe first drawback is,\nit turns out the pleasant life,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.395\nyour experience of positive emotion,\n\n00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:41.340\nis about 50 percent heritable,\n\n00:10:41.364 --> 00:10:44.934\nand, in fact, not very modifiable.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:49.497\nSo the different tricks\nthat Matthieu and I and others know\n\n00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:53.132\nabout increasing the amount\nof positive emotion in your life\n\n00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:57.132\nare 15 to 20 percent tricks,\ngetting more of it.\n\n00:10:57.454 --> 00:11:01.696\nSecond is that positive\nemotion habituates.\n\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.520\nIt habituates rapidly, indeed.\n\n00:11:05.544 --> 00:11:07.914\nIt's all like French vanilla ice cream:\n\n00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.553\nthe first taste is 100 percent;\n\n00:11:10.577 --> 00:11:12.746\nby the time you're down\nto the sixth taste,\n\n00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.927\nit's gone.\n\n00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.747\nAnd, as I said,\nit's not particularly malleable.\n\n00:11:20.398 --> 00:11:22.265\nAnd this leads to the second life.\n\n00:11:22.289 --> 00:11:24.227\nI have to tell you about my friend Len,\n\n00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:30.162\nto talk about why positive psychology\nis more than positive emotion,\n\n00:11:30.186 --> 00:11:31.934\nmore than building pleasure.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.934\nIn two of the three great arenas\nof life, by the time Len was 30,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.382\nLen was enormously successful.\n\n00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:41.934\nThe first arena was work.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.594\nBy the time he was 20,\nhe was an options trader.\n\n00:11:44.618 --> 00:11:47.045\nBy the time he was 25,\nhe was a multimillionaire\n\n00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:49.415\nand the head of an options\ntrading company.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:55.105\nSecond, in play, he's a national\nchampion bridge player.\n\n00:11:57.164 --> 00:12:01.934\nBut in the third great arena of life,\nlove, Len is an abysmal failure.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.900\nAnd the reason he was,\nwas that Len is a cold fish.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.108\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:10.052 --> 00:12:11.958\nLen is an introvert.\n\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.934\nAmerican women said to Len,\nwhen he dated them,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.934\n\"You're no fun. You don't have\npositive emotion. Get lost.\"\n\n00:12:22.745 --> 00:12:27.934\nAnd Len was wealthy enough to be able\nto afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.702\nwho for five years tried\nto find the sexual trauma\n\n00:12:31.726 --> 00:12:35.152\nthat had somehow locked\npositive emotion inside of him.\n\n00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:38.849\nBut it turned out there wasn't\nany sexual trauma.\n\n00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:41.064\nIt turned out that --\n\n00:12:41.088 --> 00:12:43.467\nLen grew up in Long Island\n\n00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:49.073\nand he played football\nand watched football, and played bridge.\n\n00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:54.544\nLen is in the bottom five percent\nof what we call positive affectivities.\n\n00:12:54.568 --> 00:12:56.353\nThe question is: Is Len unhappy?\n\n00:12:56.616 --> 00:12:58.035\nAnd I want to say, not.\n\n00:12:58.385 --> 00:13:01.344\nContrary to what psychology told us\n\n00:13:01.368 --> 00:13:05.520\nabout the bottom 50 percent\nof the human race in positive affectivity,\n\n00:13:05.544 --> 00:13:08.136\nI think Len is one\nof the happiest people I know.\n\n00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.806\nHe's not consigned\nto the hell of unhappiness,\n\n00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.745\nand that's because Len, like most of you,\n\n00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:16.831\nis enormously capable of flow.\n\n00:13:16.855 --> 00:13:19.829\nWhen he walks onto the floor\nof the American Exchange\n\n00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:21.603\nat 9:30 in the morning,\n\n00:13:22.116 --> 00:13:23.407\ntime stops for him.\n\n00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:25.193\nAnd it stops till the closing bell.\n\n00:13:25.217 --> 00:13:28.117\nWhen the first card is played\ntill 10 days later,\n\n00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.499\nwhen the tournament is over,\n\n00:13:29.523 --> 00:13:30.933\ntime stops for Len.\n\n00:13:31.634 --> 00:13:34.846\nAnd this is indeed\nwhat Mike Csikszentmihalyi\n\n00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.772\nhas been talking about, about flow.\n\n00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:40.173\nAnd it's distinct from pleasure\nin a very important way:\n\n00:13:40.197 --> 00:13:45.601\npleasure has raw feel -- you know\nit's happening; it's thought and feeling.\n\n00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.714\nBut what Mike told you\nyesterday -- during flow ...\n\n00:13:50.877 --> 00:13:52.982\nyou can't feel anything.\n\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.181\nYou're one with the music.\n\n00:13:56.622 --> 00:13:57.875\nTime stops.\n\n00:13:57.899 --> 00:13:59.793\nYou have intense concentration.\n\n00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:04.568\nAnd this is indeed the characteristic\nof what we think of as the good life.\n\n00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.845\nAnd we think there's a recipe for it,\n\n00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:10.463\nand it's knowing what\nyour highest strengths are --\n\n00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:12.781\nagain, there's a valid test\n\n00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:15.188\nof what your five highest strengths are --\n\n00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:17.941\nand then re-crafting your life\n\n00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:21.225\nto use them as much as you possibly can.\n\n00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:23.934\nRe-crafting your work, your love,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.715\nyour play, your friendship,\nyour parenting.\n\n00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:28.319\nJust one example.\n\n00:14:29.046 --> 00:14:32.654\nOne person I worked with\nwas a bagger at Genuardi's.\n\n00:14:33.114 --> 00:14:34.279\nHated the job.\n\n00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:36.196\nShe's working her way through college.\n\n00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:39.862\nHer highest strength\nwas social intelligence.\n\n00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:44.601\nSo she re-crafted bagging\nto make the encounter with her\n\n00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:47.396\nthe social highlight\nof every customer's day.\n\n00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.596\nNow, obviously she failed.\n\n00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.934\nBut what she did was to take\nher highest strengths,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.366\nand re-craft work to use them\nas much as possible.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.306\nWhat you get out of that\nis not smiley-ness.\n\n00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.233\nYou don't look like Debbie Reynolds.\n\n00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:02.661\nYou don't giggle a lot.\n\n00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:05.271\nWhat you get is more absorption.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.032\nSo, that's the second path.\n\n00:15:08.056 --> 00:15:10.408\nThe first path, positive emotion;\n\n00:15:10.432 --> 00:15:13.528\nthe second path is eudaemonian flow;\n\n00:15:13.552 --> 00:15:15.934\nand the third path is meaning.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.934\nThis is the most venerable\nof the happinesses, traditionally.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.457\nAnd meaning, in this view, consists of --\n\n00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:26.401\nvery parallel to eudaemonia --\n\n00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.988\nit consists of knowing\nwhat your highest strengths are,\n\n00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:34.655\nand using them to belong to\nand in the service of\n\n00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:36.822\nsomething larger than you are.\n\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.132\nI mentioned that for all three\nkinds of lives --\n\n00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:46.548\nthe pleasant life, the good life,\nthe meaningful life --\n\n00:15:46.572 --> 00:15:48.736\npeople are now\nhard at work on the question:\n\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.687\nAre there things that lastingly\nchange those lives?\n\n00:15:53.726 --> 00:15:56.725\nAnd the answer seems to be yes.\n\n00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:59.304\nAnd I'll just give you some samples of it.\n\n00:15:59.328 --> 00:16:01.492\nIt's being done in a rigorous manner.\n\n00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:04.353\nIt's being done in the same way\nthat we test drugs\n\n00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:05.986\nto see what really works.\n\n00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:11.284\nSo we do random-assignment,\nplacebo-controlled,\n\n00:16:11.308 --> 00:16:14.155\nlong-term studies\nof different interventions.\n\n00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:18.684\nJust to sample the kind of interventions\nthat we find have an effect:\n\n00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:21.934\nwhen we teach people\nabout the pleasant life,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.934\nhow to have more pleasure in your life,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.977\none of your assignments\nis to take the mindfulness skills,\n\n00:16:28.001 --> 00:16:30.416\nthe savoring skills,\n\n00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.198\nand you're assigned\nto design a beautiful day.\n\n00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:39.145\nNext Saturday, set a day aside,\ndesign yourself a beautiful day,\n\n00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:43.363\nand use savoring and mindfulness\nto enhance those pleasures.\n\n00:16:43.387 --> 00:16:47.888\nAnd we can show in that way\nthat the pleasant life is enhanced.\n\n00:16:49.696 --> 00:16:50.920\nGratitude visit.\n\n00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:55.697\nI want you all to do this\nwith me now, if you would.\n\n00:16:55.721 --> 00:16:56.969\nClose your eyes.\n\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.114\nI'd like you to remember someone\n\n00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:06.186\nwho did something enormously important\n\n00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.934\nthat changed your life\nin a good direction,\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:11.891\nand who you never properly thanked.\n\n00:17:13.105 --> 00:17:14.594\nThe person has to be alive.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.121\nNow, OK, you can open your eyes.\n\n00:17:18.145 --> 00:17:20.479\nI hope all of you have such a person.\n\n00:17:20.503 --> 00:17:24.101\nYour assignment, when you're learning\nthe gratitude visit,\n\n00:17:24.125 --> 00:17:27.774\nis to write a 300-word\ntestimonial to that person,\n\n00:17:28.492 --> 00:17:30.421\ncall them on the phone in Phoenix,\n\n00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:33.766\nask if you can visit, don't tell them why.\n\n00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:35.293\nShow up at their door,\n\n00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:40.254\nyou read the testimonial --\neveryone weeps when this happens.\n\n00:17:41.537 --> 00:17:44.439\nAnd what happens is, when we test people\n\n00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.582\none week later, a month later,\nthree months later,\n\n00:17:47.606 --> 00:17:50.264\nthey're both happier and less depressed.\n\n00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.015\nAnother example is a strengths date,\n\n00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:58.221\nin which we get couples to identify\ntheir highest strengths\n\n00:17:58.245 --> 00:17:59.620\non the strengths test,\n\n00:17:59.644 --> 00:18:04.725\nand then to design an evening\nin which they both use their strengths.\n\n00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:08.242\nWe find this is a strengthener\nof relationships.\n\n00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:10.720\nAnd fun versus philanthropy.\n\n00:18:10.744 --> 00:18:13.464\nIt's so heartening\nto be in a group like this,\n\n00:18:13.488 --> 00:18:17.088\nin which so many of you have turned\nyour lives to philanthropy.\n\n00:18:17.112 --> 00:18:20.770\nWell, my undergraduates and the people\nI work with haven't discovered this,\n\n00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:23.602\nso we actually have people\ndo something altruistic\n\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.044\nand do something fun,\n\n00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:27.309\nand contrast it.\n\n00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.934\nAnd what you find\nis when you do something fun,\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.847\nit has a square wave walk set.\n\n00:18:31.871 --> 00:18:35.507\nWhen you do something philanthropic\nto help another person,\n\n00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.620\nit lasts and it lasts.\n\n00:18:38.484 --> 00:18:42.004\nSo those are examples\nof positive interventions.\n\n00:18:42.638 --> 00:18:46.054\nSo the next to last thing\nI want to say is:\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:50.077\nwe're interested in how much\nlife satisfaction people have.\n\n00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.041\nThis is really what you're about.\n\n00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:53.934\nAnd that's our target variable.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.934\nAnd we ask the question as a function\nof the three different lives,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.174\nhow much life satisfaction do you get?\n\n00:19:00.705 --> 00:19:03.810\nSo we ask -- and we've done this\nin 15 replications,\n\n00:19:03.834 --> 00:19:06.212\ninvolving thousands of people:\n\n00:19:06.236 --> 00:19:08.731\nTo what extent does\nthe pursuit of pleasure,\n\n00:19:08.755 --> 00:19:10.527\nthe pursuit of positive emotion,\n\n00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.275\nthe pleasant life,\n\n00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:15.707\nthe pursuit of engagement,\ntime stopping for you,\n\n00:19:15.731 --> 00:19:19.105\nand the pursuit of meaning\ncontribute to life satisfaction?\n\n00:19:19.129 --> 00:19:22.723\nAnd our results surprised us;\nthey were backward of what we thought.\n\n00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:26.251\nIt turns out the pursuit of pleasure\nhas almost no contribution\n\n00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:27.934\nto life satisfaction.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.487\nThe pursuit of meaning is the strongest.\n\n00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:34.658\nThe pursuit of engagement\nis also very strong.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:39.592\nWhere pleasure matters\nis if you have both engagement\n\n00:19:39.616 --> 00:19:41.225\nand you have meaning,\n\n00:19:41.249 --> 00:19:43.538\nthen pleasure's the whipped\ncream and the cherry.\n\n00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:50.080\nWhich is to say, the full life --\nthe sum is greater than the parts,\n\n00:19:50.104 --> 00:19:51.510\nif you've got all three.\n\n00:19:51.534 --> 00:19:54.776\nConversely, if you have none\nof the three, the empty life,\n\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.457\nthe sum is less than the parts.\n\n00:19:56.481 --> 00:20:00.732\nAnd what we're asking now is:\nDoes the very same relationship --\n\n00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:05.699\nphysical health, morbidity,\nhow long you live and productivity --\n\n00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:07.132\nfollow the same relationship?\n\n00:20:07.156 --> 00:20:09.634\nThat is, in a corporation,\n\n00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:15.497\nis productivity a function of positive\nemotion, engagement and meaning?\n\n00:20:15.521 --> 00:20:18.688\nIs health a function\nof positive engagement,\n\n00:20:18.712 --> 00:20:21.449\nof pleasure, and of meaning in life?\n\n00:20:21.473 --> 00:20:25.688\nAnd there is reason to think the answer\nto both of those may well be yes.\n\n00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:32.591\nSo, Chris said that the last\nspeaker had a chance\n\n00:20:32.615 --> 00:20:35.036\nto try to integrate what he heard,\n\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.766\nand so this was amazing for me.\n\n00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.084\nI've never been in a gathering like this.\n\n00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:44.483\nI've never seen speakers stretch\nbeyond themselves so much,\n\n00:20:44.507 --> 00:20:46.579\nwhich was one of the remarkable things.\n\n00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:50.934\nBut I found that the problems\nof psychology seemed to be parallel\n\n00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:55.173\nto the problems of technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:20:55.197 --> 00:20:56.672\nin the following way:\n\n00:20:56.696 --> 00:21:00.178\nwe all know that technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:05.202\nhave been and can be used\nfor destructive purposes.\n\n00:21:06.329 --> 00:21:10.484\nWe also know that technology,\nentertainment and design\n\n00:21:10.508 --> 00:21:13.027\ncan be used to relieve misery.\n\n00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:16.934\nAnd by the way, the distinction\nbetween relieving misery\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.934\nand building happiness\nis extremely important.\n\n00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:23.569\nI thought, when I first became\na therapist 30 years ago,\n\n00:21:23.593 --> 00:21:28.934\nthat if I was good enough\nto make someone not depressed,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:32.006\nnot anxious, not angry,\n\n00:21:32.825 --> 00:21:34.291\nthat I'd make them happy.\n\n00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.235\nAnd I never found that;\n\n00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:38.281\nI found the best you could ever do\n\n00:21:38.305 --> 00:21:39.707\nwas to get to zero;\n\n00:21:40.308 --> 00:21:41.522\nthat they were empty.\n\n00:21:41.546 --> 00:21:47.152\nAnd it turns out the skills of happiness,\nthe skills of the pleasant life,\n\n00:21:47.176 --> 00:21:49.547\nthe skills of engagement,\nthe skills of meaning,\n\n00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:53.722\nare different from the skills\nof relieving misery.\n\n00:21:54.293 --> 00:21:59.664\nAnd so, the parallel thing holds\nwith technology, entertainment\n\n00:21:59.688 --> 00:22:01.261\nand design, I believe.\n\n00:22:01.285 --> 00:22:08.164\nThat is, it is possible\nfor these three drivers of our world\n\n00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:10.403\nto increase happiness,\n\n00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:13.604\nto increase positive emotion.\n\n00:22:13.628 --> 00:22:15.815\nAnd that's typically\nhow they've been used.\n\n00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:18.449\nBut once you fractionate\nhappiness the way I do --\n\n00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:21.934\nnot just positive emotion,\nthat's not nearly enough --\n\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:25.091\nthere's flow in life,\nand there's meaning in life.\n\n00:22:25.464 --> 00:22:26.934\nAs Laura Lee told us,\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:30.626\ndesign and, I believe,\nentertainment and technology,\n\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.381\ncan be used to increase meaning\nengagement in life as well.\n\n00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:37.025\nSo in conclusion,\n\n00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:39.476\nthe eleventh reason for optimism,\n\n00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.675\nin addition to the space elevator,\n\n00:22:42.699 --> 00:22:47.830\nis that I think with technology,\nentertainment and design,\n\n00:22:47.854 --> 00:22:51.602\nwe can actually increase\nthe amount of tonnage\n\n00:22:51.626 --> 00:22:53.876\nof human happiness on the planet.\n\n00:22:54.479 --> 00:22:58.742\nAnd if technology can,\nin the next decade or two,\n\n00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:02.630\nincrease the pleasant life,\nthe good life and the meaningful life,\n\n00:23:02.654 --> 00:23:04.144\nit will be good enough.\n\n00:23:04.168 --> 00:23:09.773\nIf entertainment can be diverted\nto also increase positive emotion,\n\n00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:13.019\nmeaning eudaemonia,\n\n00:23:13.043 -->

southern Africa dates back hundreds of years. But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire. Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.So, here you can see the change from use \u2014 starting to use contemporary materials. These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s. In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design. And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year. Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary. So I developed a whole range around \u2014 mass-produced range \u2014 that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms. The scale became very important, and it's become our pet project. It's successful, it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops, and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.This is our group, our main group of weavers. They come on a weekly basis to Durban. They all have bank accounts. They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from. It's a weekly turnaround of production. This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of. And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers. And the rest says it all.Thank you very much.

Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence, but that are never sentimental, that never look away from the darkest things about us. Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful than when we're most ugly. Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of. As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria with a whole generation \u2014 in the '80s \u2014 of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended. So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.But what I've come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures, but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion, everyday acts of compassion. In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu. Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says, the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me. But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window. I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window. Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good. It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee and send emails and make notes. So what Ubuntu really says is that there is no way for us to be human without other people. It's really very simple, but really very complicated.So, I thought I should start with some stories. I should tell you some stories about remarkable people, so I thought I'd start with my mother. (Laughter) And she was dark, too. My mother was English. My parents met in Oxford in the '50s, and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there. She was five foot two, very feisty and very English. This is how English my mother is \u2014 or was, she just passed. She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me, and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing. (Laughter) And then we went to a fish restaurant, and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us, and he came up and my mother said, \"Do you have any specials, young man?\" And Chad says, \"Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon, that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust. It's totally rad.\" And my mother turned to me and said, \"What language is he speaking?\" (Laughter) I said, \"English, mum.\" And she shook her head and said, \"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language, why don't they use it?\" (Laughter)So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism when she married my father \u2014 and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert \u2014 decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria, particularly among Igbo women, the Billings ovulation method, which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church. But her Igbo wasn't too good. So she took me along to translate. I was seven. (Laughter) So, here are these women, who never discuss their period with their husbands, and here I am telling them, \"Well, how often do you get your period?\" (Laughter) And, \"Do you notice any discharges?\" (Laughter) And, \"How swollen is your vulva?\" (Laughter) She never would have thought of herself as a feminist, my mother, but she always used to say, \"Anything a man can do, I can fix.\" (Applause) And when my father complained about this situation, where she's taking a seven-year-old boy to teach this birth control, you know, he used to say, \"Oh, you're turning him into \u2014 you're teaching him how to be a woman.\" My mother said, \"Someone has to.\" (Laughter)This woman \u2014 during the Biafran war, we were caught in the war. It was my mother with five little children. It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp, to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country. At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine, and make him a boy soldier. Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman, standing up to men with guns who want to kill us? All through that one year, my mother never cried one time, not once. But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport, about to fly to England, this woman saw my mother wearing this dress, which had been washed so many times it was basically see through, with five really hungry-looking kids, came over and asked her what had happened. And she told this woman. And so this woman emptied out her suitcase and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us, and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 that was the only time she cried. And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother, and I asked her, \"Why did you cry then?\" And she said, \"You know, you can steel your heart against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror. But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger will unstitch you.\"The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened, memorized the names of every dead person, and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names. Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you. And they would sing them only when they planted the rice, as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice. But when it came for harvest time, they would sing these joyful songs, that were made up of the names of every child who had been born that year. And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge, they would remove as many names of the dead that equaled as many people that were born. And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation, beautiful transformation.Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda, the word for rape and the word for marriage was the same one? But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda. Did you also know that after apartheid, when the new government went into the parliament houses, there were no female toilets in the building? Which would seem to suggest that apartheid was entirely the business of men. All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death, women are never really counted. Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.When I was growing up in Nigeria \u2014 and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general, but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from \u2014 there were always rites of passage for young men. Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women, that's essentially what it is. And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals, progressing along, so when I turned 13 \u2014 and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community, somebody had to kill the animals, there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at \u2014 so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat. And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it, but I had to do it. And I was supposed to do this alone. But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel, who was significantly older than me, who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war, decided to come with me. Which sort of made me feel good, because he'd seen a lot of things. Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me stories about how he used to bayonet people, and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running. So, this guy comes with me. And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one \u2014 they sound like human beings, that's why we call tragedies \"a song of a goat.\" My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human until we started keeping goats. Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes. So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't, Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat, covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them, while I kill the goat. It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much, and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed such a quotidian experience, still found it in himself to try to protect me. I was a wimp. I cried for a very long time. And afterwards, he didn't say a word. He just sat there watching me cry for an hour. And then afterwards he said to me, \"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time, you will die of heartbreak. Just know that it is enough sometimes to know that it is difficult.\" Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep, and not in good ways. (Laughter)So, I was born two days after Christmas. So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything, but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas. So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany, and we had the Catholic priest over, my mother was entertaining him with tea. And my uncle suddenly says, \"Where are Chris' presents?\" And my mother said, \"Don't talk about that in front of guests.\" But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back, so he summoned me up, and he said, \"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom. Take anything you want out of the suitcase. It's your birthday present.\" I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt, but I found an inflatable sheep. (Laughter) So, I blew it up and ran into the living room, my finger where it shouldn't have been, I was waving this buzzing sheep around, and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock. (Laughter) And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered, just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said, \"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.\" (Laughter) (Applause)My last days in prison, the last 18 months, my cellmate \u2014 for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months \u2014 my cellmate was 14 years old. The name was John James, and in those days, if a family member committed a crime, the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in. So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row. And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner. There were some really bad people there. And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books \u2014 \"Spiderman\" and \"X-Men.\" He was obsessed. And when he got tired of reading them, he started to teach the men in death row how to read, with these comic books. And so, I remember night after night, you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals, huddled around John James, reciting, \"Take that, Spidey!\" (Laughter) It's incredible. I was really worried. He didn't know what death row meant. I'd been there twice, and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die. And he would always laugh, and say, \"Come on, man, we'll make it out.\" Then I'd say, \"How do you know?\" And he said, \"Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.\" They killed him. They handcuffed him to a chair, and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail, then left him there to bleed to death. That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known. All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods. They would come together as a community, and they would express a wish. And their wish would then be brought to a priest, who would find a ritual object, and the appropriate sacrifices would be made, and the shrine would be built for the god. But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice, the Igbos would destroy the god. They would knock down the shrine, and they would stop saying the god's name. This is how they came to reclaim their humanity. Every day, all of us here, we're building gods that have gone rampant, and it's time we started knocking them down and forgetting their names. It doesn't require a tremendous thing. All it requires is to recognize among us, every day \u2014 the few of us that can see \u2014 are surrounded by people like the ones I've told you.There are some of you in this room, amazing people, who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity. I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton. The poem is called \"Libation,\" and it's for my friend Vusi who is in the audience here somewhere. \"Libation, North Carolina, 1999. I offer to this ground, this gin. I imagine an old man crying here, out of the sight of the overseer. He pushes his tongue through a hole where his tooth would be, if he were whole. It aches in that space where his tooth would be, where his land would be, his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter. He wipes sorrow from his face, and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue, and tastes the salt. I call a name that could be his. This is for you, old man.

We gave them a language,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nwhy don't they use it?\"\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo, this woman, who converted from the Church of England\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nto Catholicism when she married my father --\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\ndecided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nparticularly among Igbo women,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nthe Billings ovulation method,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nwhich was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nBut her Igbo wasn't too good.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nSo she took me along to translate.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI was seven.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nSo, here are these women,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nwho never discuss their period with their husbands,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand here I am telling them, \"Well, how often do you get your period?\"\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:50.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd, \"Do you notice any discharges?\"\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nAnd, \"How swollen is your vulva?\"\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nShe never would have thought of herself as a feminist,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nmy mother, but she always used to say,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n\"Anything a man can do, I can fix.\"\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd when my father complained about this situation,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nwhere she's taking a seven-year-old boy\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nto teach this birth control, you know,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nhe used to say, \"Oh, you're turning him into --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nyou're teaching him how to be a woman.\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nMy mother said, \"Someone has to.\"\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:32.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThis woman -- during the Biafran war,\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nwe were caught in the war.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt was my mother with five little children.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIt takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nto make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nAt every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwho want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand make him a boy soldier.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nCan you imagine this five-foot-two woman,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nstanding up to men with guns who want to kill us?\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAll through that one year,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nmy mother never cried one time, not once.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nBut when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nabout to fly to England,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthis woman saw my mother wearing this dress,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhich had been washed so many times it was basically see through,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwith five really hungry-looking kids,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\ncame over and asked her what had happened.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd she told this woman.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd so this woman emptied out her suitcase\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nand the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat was the only time she cried.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nAnd I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nand I asked her, \"Why did you cry then?\"\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd she said, \"You know, you can steel your heart\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nagainst any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nBut the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nwill unstitch you.\"\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nmemorized the names of every dead person,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nDirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAnd they would sing them only when they planted the rice,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nas though they were seeding the hearts of the dead\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\ninto the rice.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nBut when it came for harvest time,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nthey would sing these joyful songs,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat were made up of the names of every child\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwho had been born that year.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnd then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nthey would remove as many names of the dead\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat equaled as many people that were born.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nbeautiful transformation.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nDid you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nthe word for rape and the word for marriage\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nwas the same one?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nDid you also know that after apartheid,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nwhen the new government went into the parliament houses,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nthere were no female toilets in the building?\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhich would seem to suggest that apartheid\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nwas entirely the business of men.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAll of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwomen are never really counted.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nTheir humanity never seems to matter very much to us.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nWhen I was growing up in Nigeria --\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nbut in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthere were always rites of passage for young men.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nMen were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthat's essentially what it is.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nprogressing along, so when I turned 13 --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nand, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nsomebody had to kill the animals,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthere was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nso when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nAnd I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut I had to do it.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nAnd I was supposed to do this alone.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nBut a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwho was significantly older than me,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nwho'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\ndecided to come with me.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWhich sort of made me feel good,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nbecause he'd seen a lot of things.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nNow, when I was growing up, he used to tell me\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nstories about how he used to bayonet people,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo, this guy comes with me.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nAnd I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nthey sound like human beings,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthat's why we call tragedies \"a song of a goat.\"\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nMy friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nuntil we started keeping goats.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nAnyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nSo when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nEmmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\ncovers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwhile I kill the goat.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nIt didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nsuch a quotidian experience,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nstill found it in himself to try to protect me.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nI was a wimp.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nI cried for a very long time.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd afterwards, he didn't say a word.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nHe just sat there watching me cry for an hour.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd then afterwards he said to me,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\n\"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nyou will die of heartbreak.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nJust know that it is enough sometimes\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nto know that it is difficult.\"\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nOf course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand not in good ways.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nSo, I was born two days after Christmas.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbut I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nSo, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nand we had the Catholic priest over,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nmy mother was entertaining him with tea.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAnd my uncle suddenly says, \"Where are Chris' presents?\"\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd my mother said, \"Don't talk about that in front of guests.\"\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBut he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nso he summoned me up, and he said,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\n\"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nTake anything you want out of the suitcase.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt's your birthday present.\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nI'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nbut I found an inflatable sheep.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nSo, I blew it up and ran into the living room,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nmy finger where it shouldn't have been,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nI was waving this buzzing sheep around,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nand my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\njust stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\n\"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish.\"\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nMy last days in prison, the last 18 months,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nmy cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nmy cellmate was 14 years old.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe name was John James,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nand in those days, if a family member committed a crime,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nthe military would hold you as ransom\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\ntill your family turned themselves in.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThere were some really bad people there.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nAnd he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:11:59.958\n\"Spiderman\" and \"X-Men.\"\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nHe was obsessed.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd when he got tired of reading them,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nhe started to teach the men in death row how to read,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nwith these comic books.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd so, I remember night after night,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nyou'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nhuddled around John James, reciting, \"Take that, Spidey!\"\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's incredible.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nI was really worried.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHe didn't know what death row meant.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nI'd been there twice,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nand I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd he would always laugh, and say,\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\n\"Come on, man, we'll make it out.\"\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThen I'd say, \"How do you know?\"\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nAnd he said, \"Oh, I heard it on the grapevine.\"\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThey killed him.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThey handcuffed him to a chair,\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nthen left him there to bleed to death.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThat's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAll around us, everywhere, there are people like this.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThe Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThey would come together as a community,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand they would express a wish.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nAnd their wish would then be brought to a priest,\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwho would find a ritual object,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nand the appropriate sacrifices would be made,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand the shrine would be built for the god.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nBut if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthe Igbos would destroy the god.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nThey would knock down the shrine,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nand they would stop saying the god's name.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThis is how they came to reclaim their humanity.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nEvery day, all of us here,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nwe're building gods that have gone rampant,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand it's time we started knocking them down\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nand forgetting their names.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIt doesn't require a tremendous thing.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nAll it requires is to recognize among us, every day --\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nthe few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nlike the ones I've told you.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThere are some of you in this room, amazing people,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nwho offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nThe poem is called \"Libation,\" and it's for my friend Vusi\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nwho is in the audience here somewhere.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\n\"Libation,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nNorth Carolina, 1999.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nI offer to this ground, this gin.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nI imagine an old man crying here,\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nout of the sight of the overseer.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nHe pushes his tongue through a hole\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwhere his tooth would be, if he were whole.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nIt aches in that space where his tooth would be,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nwhere his land would be,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nhis house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nHe wipes sorrow from his face,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nand puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nand tastes the salt.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nI call a name that could be his.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nThis is for you, old man.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nThis gin, this salty

"https://www.ted.com/talks/louise_leakey_digs_for_humanity_s_origins", "transcript": "Who are we? That is the big question. And essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained, super-intelligent ape. This could be us. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens, and it's important to remember that, in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth.We are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today. And that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately, or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years. But as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.And it's important to remember that, because the bonobos are so human, and they share 99 percent of their genes with us. And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes. It's important to remember that we evolved. Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past, and we have a common future. And it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today. And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity, and it's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family, as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.And this is how we look for them. A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of Africa, looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface. And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils. I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side. (Laughter) It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past. We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.When we find a fossil, we mark it. Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it. And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today. When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes. And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.And these things are so exciting. They are so often the only, or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains. And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors. And it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother. (Laughter) Not many people can say that.But now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago. I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa, it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape. Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley. It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden, or runs down to Lake Malawi. And the Rift Valley is a depression. It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin, carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you. (Laughter) OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors, because it's incredibly difficult, A, for these things to become \u2014 to be \u2014 preserved, and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface. And we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains, and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.So, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin in the very north of our country, Kenya. And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there. Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin, which represents some 20,000 square miles. That's a huge job that we've got on our hands. Two million years ago at Lake Turkana, Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors, actually lived in this region. You can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago, Homo erectus, up in the far right corner, lived alongside three other species of human ancestor. And here is a skull of a Homo erectus, which I just pulled off the shelf there. (Laughter)But it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm. In fact, if you go back in time, it is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. Where did these things come from? That's what we're still trying to find answers to, and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception. Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils that have been found from Lake Turkana.But I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya, essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana in search of human remains. And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough, fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile. And we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that. But when I was 12, as I was in this picture, a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side, when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.I could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well, because I was the same age that he was when he died. And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned. His brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so. He was very able to use stones effectively as tools. And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here, actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child. He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after quite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller, members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12. Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp and couldn't get out. Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried and beautifully preserved.And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid. It's actually this little piece up here on the top. Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment. And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope. We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones, the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones, things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus. It was truly exciting. He had a body very similar to our own, and he was on the threshold of becoming human.Well, shortly afterwards, members of his species started to move northwards out of Africa, and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia. So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa and begin its spread across the globe. Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned, from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia. But also, surprising finds recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia, where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated, and have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height. But they lived only 18,000 years ago, and that is truly extraordinary to think about.Just to put this in terms of generations, because people do find it hard to think of time, Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago. We evolved essentially from an African stock. Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us. And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago. And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes shared the planet Earth.The question now is, well, who are we? We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species, with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps. (Laughter) For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all. We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors. Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?And what is it that really makes us us? I think it's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness. From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones, we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use has really reached unprecedented levels: we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome; and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.And we've also managed to communicate with people all over the world, from extraordinary places. Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya, we can talk to people about what we're doing. As Al Gore so clearly has reminded us, we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet. Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth, if you look at the fossil record, for about, on average, a million years at a time. We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.And last year, our population grew by 80 million. I mean, these are extraordinary numbers. You can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book. But what's happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important as anything else that's being done in the world today. But we have to control our numbers, because we can't really hold it together as a species.My father so appropriately put it, that \"We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.\" Can we hold it together? It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa. We all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice, and we have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together today. We could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to. But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?Well, to end on a very positive note, I think evolutionarily speaking, this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end. I'll leave it at that, thank you very much.

Earth today.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd that's just a tiny fraction of all species\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nthat have ever lived on the planet in past times.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nWe're one species out of approximately,\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nor let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthat have existed over the past six to eight million years.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nBut as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthat exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd it's important to remember that,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nbecause the bonobos are so human,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand they share 99 percent of their genes with us.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nIt's important to remember that we evolved.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nNow, I know that's a dirty word for some people,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nbut we evolved from common ancestors\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nwith the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWe have a common past, and we have a common future.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd it is important to remember that all of these great apes\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nhave come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nas we ourselves have today.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nand it's this journey that has been the focus\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nof the past three generations of my family,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nas we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nof our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd this is how we look for them.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nA group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nout across vast areas of Africa,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nlooking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd that's an example of what we may do as we walk across\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nthe landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nI doubt many of you in the audience can see\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nthe fossil that's in this picture,\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nbut if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nof a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nas it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIt's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nto begin to piece together our past.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWe still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWhen we find a fossil, we mark it.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nToday, we've got great technology: we have GPS.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nWe mark it with a GPS fix,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nso we could essentially put it back on the surface,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nexactly where we found it.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nAnd we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nWhen we then find something very important,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nlike the bones of a human ancestor,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nusing dental picks and fine paintbrushes.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd all the sediment is then put through these screens,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand where we go again through it very carefully,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nlooking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nor the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwere digging up some remains of human ancestors.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nAnd it is one of the most special things\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nto ever do with your mother.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nNot many people can say that.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nBut now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nI'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nit does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nNow we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nIt essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nor runs down to Lake Malawi.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nAnd the Rift Valley is a depression.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nIt's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\ncarrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIf you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nwhere your bones will be rapidly buried.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nYou then hope that the earth moves in such a way\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nas to bring the bones back up to the surface.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd then you hope that one of us lot\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nwill walk around and find small pieces of you.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nOK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nas we do know today about our ancestors,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nbecause it's incredibly difficult,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nA, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nand begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nSo, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nin the very north of our country, Kenya.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nAnd if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nof the animals that lived there.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nFossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nwhich represents some 20,000 square miles.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThat's a huge job that we've got on our hands.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nTwo million years ago at Lake Turkana,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nHomo erectus, one of our human ancestors,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nactually lived in this region.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nYou can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nin the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nHomo erectus, up in the far right corner,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nlived alongside three other species of human ancestor.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd here is a skull of a Homo erectus,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nwhich I just pulled off the shelf there.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nBut it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nIn fact, if you go back in time,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nor of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nWhere did these things come from?\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nThat's what we're still trying to find answers to,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand it is important to realize that there is diversity\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nin all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nHere's some reconstructions of some of the fossils\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nthat have been found from Lake Turkana.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nBut I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nessentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nin search of human remains.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nfossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut when I was 12, as I was in this picture,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\na very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nwhen they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nI could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nbecause I was the same age that he was when he died.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nHis brothers certainly were able to run long distances\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nchasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nHe was very able to use stones effectively as tools.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nactually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nHe had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nquite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nmembers of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nUnfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand couldn't get out.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nEssentially, his bones were rapidly buried\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nand beautifully preserved.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd he remained there until 1.6 million years later,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhen this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nwalked along a small hillside\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\namongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nIt's actually this little piece up here on the top.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nWell, an excavation was begun immediately,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand more and more little bits of skull\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nstarted to be extracted from the sediment.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nAnd what was so fun about it was this:\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nthe skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand fairly recently the tree had grown up,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbut it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nand so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nholding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nWe began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthe bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthings that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was truly exciting.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nHe had a body very similar to our own,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand he was on the threshold of becoming human.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nWell, shortly afterwards, members of his species\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nstarted to move northwards out of Africa,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand you start to see fossils of Homo erectus\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nin Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nSo, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand begin its spread across the globe.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nSome exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nfrom Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nBut also, surprising finds\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nrecently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nwhere a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBut they lived only 18,000 years ago,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nand that is truly extraordinary to think about.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nJust to put this in terms of generations,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nbecause people do find it hard to think of time,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nHomo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nWe evolved essentially from an African stock.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAgain, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAnd we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nshared the planet Earth.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nThe question now is, well, who are we?\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nWe're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nwith a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nFor the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nWe have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIs this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd what is it that really makes us us?\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nI think it's our collective intelligence.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nIt's our ability to write things down,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nour language and our consciousness.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nFrom very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nwe now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nhas really reached unprecedented levels:\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwe've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nand recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd we've also managed to communicate with people\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nall over the world, from extraordinary places.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nEven from within an excavation in northern Kenya,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwe can talk to people about what we're doing.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nAs Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nwe have reached extraordinary numbers\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nof people on this planet.\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nHuman ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nif you look at the fossil record,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nfor about, on average, a million years at a time.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nWe've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nyet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAnd last year, our population grew by 80 million.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI mean, these are extraordinary numbers.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nYou can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nBut what's happened is our technology\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nhas removed the checks and balances on our population growth.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nas anything else that's being done in the world today.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nBut we have to control our numbers,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause we can't really hold it together as a species.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nMy father so appropriately put it,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nthat \"We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nthat are bad for our survival as a species.\"\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nCan we hold it together?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nIt's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe all have an African origin.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nWe have a common past and we share a common future.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nEvolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe're sitting on the edge of a precipice,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand we have the tools and the technology at our hands\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto communicate what needs to be done\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nto hold it together today.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nWe could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nBut will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWell, to end on a very positive note,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nI think evolutionarily speaking,\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthis is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nI'll leave it at that, thank you very much.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The web as art", "duration": "1229", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_harris_collects_stories", "transcript": "So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways. This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life. You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons. Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories. So this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made. And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality \u2014 so, real stories. And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories, stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life, which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently. So I'll be talking about each of those today. So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks. I have many of these books, and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years. They accompany me wherever I go in my life, and I fill them with all sorts of things, records of my lived experience: so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see, dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins, business cards, writings. And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that I meet. And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years, I started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts, but also the artifacts of other people. So, I started collecting found objects. This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City about 10 years ago. On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face, and on the back it says, \"To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice. Have fun in whatever you do.\" And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life. As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story, and then letting your own mind fill in the rest. And that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today. So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University, and I noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts, not just from street corners, but also from the Internet. And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives. Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions, all of these things were being expressed by people online, and leaving behind trails. So, I started to write computer programs that study very, very large sets of these online footprints. One such project is about a year and a half old. It's called \"We Feel Fine.\" This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases \"I feel\" and \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases, it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author. So, their gender, their age, their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence. It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it's been running for about a year and a half, having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now. This is, then, how they're presented. These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's feelings from the last few hours, each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger. And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside, so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad. And the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside. So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer. \"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,\" from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan. \"I got this on some trading locally, but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.\" Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts. And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created, which consist of the sentence and images being combined. And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside. \"I feel good.\" \"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds, but it was worth it.\" \"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature \u2014 butterflies, man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.\" So the next movement is called mobs. This provides a slightly more statistical look at things. This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now, dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on. Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around, the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down, and the snowy ones flutter to the ground. You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside. Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution. So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from \"We Feel Fine.\" These are the images that are automatically constructed. \"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.\" (Laughter) \"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good, the kisses felt messy and wrong, but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.\" \"I can feel my cancer grow.\" \"I feel pretty.\" \"I feel skinny, but I'm not.\" \"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict, and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.\" \"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month, because I feel the need for speed.\" (Laughter) \"I feel sassy.\" \"I feel so sexy in this new wig.\" As you can see, \"We Feel Fine\" collects very, very small-scale personal stories. Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words. So, really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story. And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story. And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world, not with the Internet, and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium. So these are some newer projects that actually aren't even launched publicly yet. The first such one is called \"The Whale Hunt.\" Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the United States, with a family of Inupiat Eskimos, documenting their annual spring whale hunt. This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore, camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice. And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime. And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here, waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does, it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up under the ice, and cuts it up. And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time. So I went up there, and I lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience, beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York, and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later. I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals. So every five minutes, I took a photograph. When I was awake, with the camera around my neck. When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer. And then in moments of high adrenaline, like when something exciting was happening, I would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes. So what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat. That was the first concept here. The second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story. What are the things that make up a story? So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts. Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts. They have colors. What do they look like? They have time. When did it take place? Dates \u2014 when did it occur? And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level. The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums that we're accustomed to \u2014 things like novels, radio, photographs, movies, even lectures like this one \u2014 we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position, some kind of omniscient, external body through whose eyes you see the story. We're very used to this. But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all. I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex, and there's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other. And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of \"The Whale Hunt,\" how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford, involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3, with an excitement level of high? So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story? I built a web interface for viewing \"The Whale Hunt\" that attempts to do just this. So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there. This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean, and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later. You can start to see some of the story here, told by color. So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where I was staying. And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean. Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up. You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story. These are organized chronologically. Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same, so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically. And any of these can be clicked, and then the narrative is entered at that position. So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska. That's \"Moby Dick.\" This is the food we ate. This is in the Patkotak's family living room in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us. Cigarette break outside \u2014 I don't smoke. This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping. This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean. This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph, showing the exciting moments of adrenaline. This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built. And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories. So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in \"The Whale Hunt\" and the two whales that were killed down here. And we could do something as arbitrary as, say, extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean, at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast. And now we've whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs, and then we can enter the narrative at that position. And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here. These whales are about 40 feet long, and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source for the community for much of the year. Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass. They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades, and an incredibly efficient process. This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass. This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution. It's baleen. Moving on. So what I'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet. So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that, I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom nestled between Tibet and India. And I was doing a project there about happiness, interviewing a lot of local people. So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product, and they've been doing this since the '70s. And it leads to just a completely different value system. It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture, where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy. So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas. So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions, and took a number of set photographs, and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures. I would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd. And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold. So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons, and some really sad soul holding one balloon. But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy. (Laughter) And then I would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy. And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish. And when they made a wish, I would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it. So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with. This is an 11-year-old student. He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town, and they all had plastic toy guns. His wish was to become a police officer. He was getting started early. Those were his hands. I took pictures of everybody's hands, because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody, and asked everybody to make a funny face. A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy. She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan, and it's a lot easier if you're a boy. A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner. If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there. He wanted to help poor people. A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat, and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make. She wanted to keep farming until she dies. You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here. She was wearing this silver ring that had the word \"love\" engraved on it, and she'd found it in the road somewhere. A 16-year-old quarry worker. This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight, but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer. A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy. He wanted to live a long life at the monastery. He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face, which I'm told is very good luck. He was kind of too shy to make a funny face. A 16-year-old student. She wanted to become an independent woman. I asked her about that, and she said she meant that she doesn't want to be married, because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman, your chances to live an independent life kind of end, and so she had no interest in that. A 24-year-old truck driver. There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic, with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road, and he was driving one of these trucks. But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people. A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break. She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road. Her wish was to marry someone with a car. She wanted a change in her life. She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road, and she wanted a different lot on things. An 81-year-old itinerant farmer. I saw this guy on the side of the road, and he actually doesn't have a home. He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work, and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at. So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live. He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face. It was all good-natured. A 10-year-old. He wanted to join a school and learn to read, but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school. He was eating this orange, sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into, and since there was so much saliva on his hands, this orange paste started to form on his palms. (Laughter) A 37-year-old road worker. One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan is the use of Indian cheap labor that they import from India to build the roads, and then they send these people home once the roads are built. So these guys were in a worker's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway. His wish was to make some money and open a store. A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road. I asked her about her wish, and she said, \"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.\" She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red. Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to. Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet. I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said, \"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent, but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.\" And I said, \"You mean, like a cave?\" And she said, \"Yeah, like a cave.\" And I said, \"Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?\" And she said, \"Well, you know, I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.\" I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way \u2014 with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter \u2014 that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from. But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years. I asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know. What if she saw the truth after just one year, what would she do for the next 35 years in her life? And this is what she said. Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe \u2014 maybe I'll die. Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes. JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time. Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die within one year, or something like that. JH: Are you hoping to? Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent. JH: Yeah, but \u2014 yeah, OK. Do you hope \u2014 would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years, or to live for one year? Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50. JH: 40 to 50? Yeah. Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven. JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it. Woman: Thank you. JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be. So thank you again, so much. Woman: You're most welcome. JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die when she was around 40. That was enough life for her. So, the last thing we did, very quickly, is I took all those wish balloons \u2014 there were 117 interviews, 117 wishes \u2014 and I brought them up to a place called Dochula, which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet, one of the more sacred places in Bhutan. And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years. And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string, and hung them up there among the prayer flags. And they're actually still flying up there today. So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future, you can go check these out. Here are some images from that. We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true. You can start to see some familiar balloons here. \"To make some money and to open a store\" was the Indian road worker. Thanks very much. (Applause)", "id": 316, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nSo I'm going to talk today about collecting stories\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nin some unconventional ways.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nThis is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nYou might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nAnyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nin collecting imaginary stories.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo this is a picture of me\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nholding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nfrom reality -- so, real stories.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nstories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nwhich is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nSo I'll be talking about each of those today.\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nSo, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nI have many of these books,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nThey accompany me wherever I go in my life,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nand I fill them with all sorts of things,\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nrecords of my lived experience:\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nso watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\ndead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nbusiness cards, writings.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nAnd in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nof moments and experiences and people that I meet.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nAnd, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nI started to become very interested in collecting\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nnot only my own personal artifacts,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nbut also the artifacts of other people.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nSo, I started collecting found objects.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThis is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nabout 10 years ago.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nOn the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nand on the back it says, \"To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nHave fun in whatever you do.\"\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nAnd I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nAs opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nand then letting your own mind fill in the rest.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nAnd that idea of a partial glimpse is something\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nthat will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nand I noticed that it was suddenly possible\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto collect these sorts of personal artifacts,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nnot just from street corners, but also from the Internet.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nof digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nBlog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nall of these things were being expressed by people online,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand leaving behind trails.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nSo, I started to write computer programs\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nthat study very, very large sets of these online footprints.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nOne such project is about a year and a half old.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nIt's called \"We Feel Fine.\"\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThis is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nevery two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:45.958\n\"I feel\" and \"I am feeling.\" And when it finds one of those phrases,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nit grabs the full sentence up to the period\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand also tries to identify demographic information about the author.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nSo, their gender, their age, their geographic location\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nand what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nIt collects about 20,000 such sentences a day\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand it's been running for about a year and a half,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nhaving collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nThis is, then, how they're presented.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThese dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nfeelings from the last few hours,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\neach dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nAnd the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nso the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd the diameter of each dot corresponds\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nto the length of the sentence inside.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nSo the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\n\"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nfor why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,\"\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nfrom a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\n\"I got this on some trading locally,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nbut really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.\"\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAlso, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwhich consist of the sentence and images being combined.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"I feel good.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\n\"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nbut it was worth it.\"\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n\"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nthat makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nman-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nSo the next movement is called mobs.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThis provides a slightly more statistical look at things.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nThis is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ndominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nWeather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nof the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nthe cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand the snowy ones flutter to the ground.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nYou can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\non a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from \"We Feel Fine.\"\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nThese are the images that are automatically constructed.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\n\"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.\"\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\n\"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nthe kisses felt messy and wrong,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nbut kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.\"\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n\"I can feel my cancer grow.\"\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\n\"I feel pretty.\"\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\n\"I feel skinny, but I'm not.\"\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\n\"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nand feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.\"\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\n\"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbecause I feel the need for speed.\"\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.958\n\"I feel sassy.\"\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n\"I feel so sexy in this new wig.\"\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAs you can see, \"We Feel Fine\" collects\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nvery, very small-scale personal stories.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSometimes, stories as short as two or three words.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nSo, really even challenging the notion\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nof what can be considered a story.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nAnd that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nnot with the Internet,\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nSo these are some newer projects that\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nactually aren't even launched publicly yet.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThe first such one is called \"The Whale Hunt.\"\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nLast May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nthe northernmost settlement in the United States,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nwith a family of Inupiat Eskimos,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ndocumenting their annual spring whale hunt.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThis is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\ncamping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd that water that you see there is the open lead,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nand through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nAnd the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nwaits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nit throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nunder the ice, and cuts it up.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nSo I went up there, and I lived with these guys\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nout in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nbeginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nand ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nI photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nSo every five minutes, I took a photograph.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nWhen I was awake, with the camera around my neck.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nWhen I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nAnd then in moments of high adrenaline,\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nlike when something exciting was happening,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nI would up that photographic frequency to as many as\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n37 photographs in five minutes.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nSo what this created was a photographic heartbeat\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nthat sped up and slowed down, more or less matching\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nthe changing pace of my own heartbeat.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nThat was the first concept here.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThe second concept was to use this experience to think about\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe fundamental components of any story.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWhat are the things that make up a story?\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nStories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThey have colors. What do they look like?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nThey have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nAnd in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nThe thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthat we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nphotographs, movies, even lectures like this one --\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nwe're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nsome kind of omniscient, external body\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nthrough whose eyes you see the story.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nWe're very used to this.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nBut if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nand there's all of these overlapping stories\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nintersecting and touching each other.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nto surface those types of stories. So, in the case of \"The Whale Hunt,\"\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nhow could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\ninvolving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\ndominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith an excitement level of high?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nI built a web interface for viewing \"The Whale Hunt\" that attempts to do just this.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nSo these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nThis is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nand the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nYou can start to see some of the story here, told by color.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nSo this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nin the basement apartment where I was staying.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nAnd things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nIntroduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nYou can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThese are organized chronologically.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nWheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nso these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nAnd any of these can be clicked,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nand then the narrative is entered at that position.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nSo here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nThat's \"Moby Dick.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThis is the food we ate.\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThis is in the Patkotak's family living room\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nin their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nCigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nThis is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nThis is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nThis graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nreminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nshowing the exciting moments of adrenaline.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nThis is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in \"The Whale Hunt\"\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nand the two whales that were killed down here.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd we could do something as arbitrary as, say,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nextract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nat Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAnd now we've whittled down that whole story\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nto just 29 matching photographs,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand then we can enter the narrative at that position.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThese whales are about 40 feet long,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nfor the community for much of the year.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nSkipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nThey use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nand an incredibly efficient process.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nThis is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThis is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nIt's baleen. Moving on.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo what I'm going to tell you about next\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nis a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nSo, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nnestled between Tibet and India.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAnd I was doing a project there about happiness,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\ninterviewing a lot of local people.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nmost of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nof gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nand they've been doing this since the '70s.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nAnd it leads to just a completely different value system.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nIt's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwhere people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nSo I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nSo, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand took a number of set photographs,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nI would start by asking people to rate their happiness\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nbetween one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand give them that number of balloons to hold.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nSo, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nand some really sad soul holding one balloon.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nAnd then I would ask them a number of questions like\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwhat was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nAnd when they made a wish, I would write their wish\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nonto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nSo I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nof some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nThis is an 11-year-old student.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nHe was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand they all had plastic toy guns.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nHis wish was to become a police officer.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nHe was getting started early. Those were his hands.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nI took pictures of everybody's hands,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nbecause I think you can often tell a lot about somebody\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nfrom how their hands look.

She was selling oranges on the side of the road.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nI asked her about her wish, and she said,\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.958\n\"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.\"\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nShe was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nover the years to turn very red.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nFinally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nHer wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nI asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.958\n\"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nbut my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.\"\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nAnd I said, \"You mean, like a cave?\" And she said, \"Yeah, like a cave.\"\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nAnd I said, \"Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?\"\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, you know,\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nI think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.\"\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nI just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwith amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthat made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:55.958\non the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nBut here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nI asked her a little bit more about the cave\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nWhat if she saw the truth after just one year,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nwhat would she do for the next 35 years in her life?\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd this is what she said.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWoman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nJonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nJH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nWoman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nwithin one year, or something like that.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nJH: Are you hoping to?\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nWoman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nJH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nwould you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nor to live for one year?\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nWoman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nJH: 40 to 50? Yeah.\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nWoman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.\n\n00:18:49.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nJH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nWoman: Thank you.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nJH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nSo thank you again, so much.\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nWoman: You're most welcome.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:04.958\nJH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nwhen she was around 40. That was enough life for her.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nSo, the last thing we did, very quickly,\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nis I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:16.958\n117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nwhich is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\none of the more sacred places in Bhutan.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nAnd up there, there are thousands of prayer flags\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nthat people have spread out over the years.\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nAnd we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nand hung them up there among the prayer flags.\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.958\nAnd they're actually still flying up there today.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nSo if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nyou can go check these out. Here are some images from that.\n\n00:19:41.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nWe said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nYou can start to see some familiar balloons here.\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:02.958\n\"To make some money and to open a store\" was the Indian road worker.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.958\nThanks very much.\n\n00:20:12.958 --> 00:20:15.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A tour of modern architecture", "duration": "921", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/reed_kroloff_on_modern_and_romantic_architecture", "transcript": "To be new at TED \u2014 it's like being the last high-school virgin. (Laughter) You know that all of the cool people are \u2014 they're doing it. And you're on the outside, you're at home. You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water. And \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited. And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be. It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes. And you want to go back and do it again. But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism. And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about. You can talk about creationism \u2014 which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it \u2014 or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z. And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today. But any kind of conversation about architecture \u2014 which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture \u2014 at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us? And our own opportunity to make something new there? This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time. I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation. I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture, a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting, safety concerns and whether carpet burns. These are just not things we talked about very often. And yet, now, it's talked about all the time. At the point where you can weaponize your buildings, you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way. And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way, we're going to think about it like this.How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that. There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover. They've made a selection. They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind, the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture. Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox, and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument, and now to an even larger instrument, upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic, as you see here. He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition, after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of New York was forced to go, \"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.\" Right. Can we do this again from the top, except use some people with a vague hint of talent, instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time, real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities. Let's bring in some real architects for a change. And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.(Laughter)It's too late. That is gone. This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team, and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme. This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center: a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it. Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision, because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever. But that's what we're going to do. But I want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents, and that these two things talk about very specifically. And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects, in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything \u2014 that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems, be they social, be they physical, be they chemical \u2014 or something that's more of a romantic solution.Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date. I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us. So, in the American tradition, the difference between the technocratic and the romantic, would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's Cartesian grids spreading across the United States, that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the United States, as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the \u2014 in Jefferson's time \u2014 current, popular philosophy of rationalism. Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny. Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny? Manifest destiny.(Laughter)It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important, it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male. And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time. I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day. We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we? Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one the moment they saw one. And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key, rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway, and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.(Laughter)Why? Why? Why do you want to do that? Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.(Laughter)It's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are. So we're going to go straight into this. Can I have the lights off for a moment? I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly that represent the current split, architecturally, between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution. And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today. One very young, one a little more mature. This is the work of a firm called SHoP, and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park. Does everybody know what a camera obscura is? Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world \u2014 it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts \u2014 and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.This is just the outline of it, and you can see, does it look like a regular building? No. It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down, square, rectangular, anything like that, that you'd see in a normal shape of a building. The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution, has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings, traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this. What's interesting about it is not the shape. What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made. A brand-new way to put buildings together, something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron. What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense, is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again. That's why we all live in developer houses. They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times. That's because it's cheaper.Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts. The computer then talks to a machine \u2014 a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine \u2014 that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine. It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts. It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time. It's not a laborer \u2014 it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time. Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings, which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life, what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions, like you used to get when you were a child, when you bought little models that said, \"Bolt A to B, and C to D.\" And so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals. Just simple \"Bolt A to B\" and they will be able to put them together. Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works \u2014 and that's what will happen in the end.You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura. Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance, these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York, as part of their young architects summer series. And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do? In the summer, you go to the beach. And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes. So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana. So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune. They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into \u2014 at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications \u2014 a set of instructions for pieces of wood. And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions. These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut. All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before. And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built. There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here. Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside. It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool. It's a great place for parties \u2014 it was, it was only up for six weeks. It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side. They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured. And they were able to do it. That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck. They were able to create that. They were able to create something wonderful. They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology. Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night. It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face. Here it is going across. And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur.Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may. Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin. This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today. The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion. It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world \u2014 such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition. \"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,\" said the owner. Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white. Every single surface of this restaurant is white. The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming. Watch this \u2014 I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen. This is happening by itself. It transforms through the magic of lighting. It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch. Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who \u2014 there you go, like that. Let's see it one more time. Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it. And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before. It's about bringing nature to the inside.In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square \u2014 I'm sorry I'm rushing \u2014 where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself. It's about stimulation. This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste. Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall. And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater, look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil. And I think I'll probably leave it at that.

And it's only taken five minutes.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nAnd you want to go back and do it again.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nBut I really appreciate being here.

There it is. Looks like that.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nThere's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThey've made a selection.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThey've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthe enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nChild-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nand moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand now to an even larger instrument,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nupon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nas you see here.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nHe was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nafter six previous firms struck out\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nwith things that were so stupid and banal\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat even the city of New York was forced to go,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n\"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up.\"\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nRight. Can we do this again from the top,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nexcept use some people with a vague hint of talent,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\ninstead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nreal estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nLet's bring in some real architects for a change.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nIt's too late. That is gone.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThis was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThis one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\na giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nNow, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nbecause what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nBut that's what we're going to do.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nBut I want you to think about these things\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nand that these two things talk about very specifically.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nin trying to decide whether we want architecture\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nfrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything --\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthat there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nbe they social, be they physical, be they chemical --\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nor something that's more of a romantic solution.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nNow, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nI mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nSo, in the American tradition,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nthe difference between the technocratic and the romantic,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nwould be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nCartesian grids spreading across the United States,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthat gives us basically the whole shape\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nof every western state in the United States,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nas a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nin Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nOr the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nNow, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nManifest destiny.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nit sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nI mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nWe all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nEveryone here must own one, or at least they craved one\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nthe moment they saw one.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nrather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nand drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWhy? Why? Why do you want to do that?\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWhy do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nIt's in our nature to go ricocheting\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nback and forth between this technocratic solution\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo we're going to go straight into this.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nCan I have the lights off for a moment?\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nI'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthat represent the current split, architecturally,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nbetween these two traditions of a technocratic\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nor technological solution and a romantic solution.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nOne very young, one a little more mature.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nThis is the work of a firm called SHoP,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nDoes everybody know what a camera obscura is?\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat takes a picture of the outside world --\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nit's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nand projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nThis is just the outline of it, and you can see,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\ndoes it look like a regular building? No.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nsquare, rectangular, anything like that,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nthat you'd see in a normal shape of a building.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nThe computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhas allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:25.958\ntraditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nWhat's interesting about it is not the shape.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nWhat's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nA brand-new way to put buildings together,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nsomething called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhat makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nis making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nThat's why we all live in developer houses.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nThey all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThat's because it's cheaper.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nMass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\na program that says, manufacture these parts.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nThe computer then talks to a machine --\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.958\na computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nthat can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nbecause the computer is just a machine.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nIt doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nIt doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nso the parts can all be cut at the same time.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nMeanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nwhich are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nwhat the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nlike you used to get when you were a child,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhen you bought little models that said, \"Bolt A to B, and C to D.\"\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd so what the builder will get is every single individual part\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nJust simple \"Bolt A to B\" and they will be able to put them together.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nHere's the little drawing that tells them how that works --\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand that's what will happen in the end.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nLest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthese same architects were asked to produce something\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nas part of their young architects summer series.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIn the summer, you go to the beach.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nSo they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nThey took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nand that computer program shaped a sand dune\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nat their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\na set of instructions for pieces of wood.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThese are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWhat you can see is there's about six different colors,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nAll of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nonly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nOnly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nand there it is fully built.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThere are only 16 different pieces of wood,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nonly 16 different assembly parts here.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nLooks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nIt has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nIt's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nwhere lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nNow, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nthis is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nreplacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthat very important pedestrian connection\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThey were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nbuilding it, including all of the parts, manufactured.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd they were able to do it. That was their design,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nusing that same computer modeling system\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nand only five or six really different kinds of parts,\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\na couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand a very simple framing system\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nThey were able to create that.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThey were able to create something wonderful.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThey're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nusing the same technology.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nHere we're going to walk across the bridge at night.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nIt's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nso the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nHere it is going across. And there, down the other side,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand you get the same kind of grandeur.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nNow, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWoo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThis is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwhose work you can see out here today.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThe current king of the romantics, who approaches his work\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nin a very different fashion.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIt's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\ninto something that you can do, into something that will please you,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nsomething that will lift your spirits,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nsomething that will make you feel as if are in another world --\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nsuch as his Nobu restaurant in New York,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:23.958\nwhich is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City\n\n00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958\n\"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,\" said the owner.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nOr his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nI want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nEvery single surface of this restaurant is white.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nThe reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nIt's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nWatch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nThis is happening by itself.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nIt transforms through the magic of lighting.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIt's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nRosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nup on the Upper West Side,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nwith this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nLet's see it one more time.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nOkay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nAnd finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nin places that you wouldn't have felt good before.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nIt's about bringing nature to the inside.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nIn the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nI'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nto make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nof the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nIt's about stimulation.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nThis is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nFizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nall explained to you by color and texture on the wall.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nAnd finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nfor the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nwhere you're asked to enter the Greek theater,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nlook under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nAnd I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much."}, {"title": "The next 5,000 days of the web", "duration": "1174", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_kelly_on_the_next_5_000_days_of_the_web", "transcript": "The Internet, the Web as we know it, the kind of Web \u2014 the things we're all talking about \u2014 is already less than 5,000 days old. So all of the things that we've seen come about, starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth, which we couldn't even imagine happening before, all these things rolling into our lives, just this abundance of things that are right before us, sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop. This kind of cornucopia of stuff just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed. It's really amazing that all this stuff is here. (Laughter) It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come. And I know that 10 years ago, if I had told you that this was all coming, you would have said that that's impossible. There's simply no economic model that that would be possible. And if I told you it was all coming for free, you would say, this is simply \u2014 you're dreaming. You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist. And yet it's here.The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago, as I looked at what even Wired was talking about, we thought it was going to be TV, but better. That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting was going to be coming. And it turns out that that's not what it was. First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was. And so one of the things that I think we're learning \u2014 if you think about, like, Wikipedia, it's something that was simply impossible. It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice. And if you take all these things that are impossible, I think one of the things that we're learning from this era, from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible, because we're unprepared for it.So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days. But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days, what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days? So, I have a kind of a simple story, and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making, this thing that has happened in 5,000 days \u2014 that's all these computers, all these handhelds, all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers \u2014 basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine. If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines, but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.And so I began to think about that. And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made. It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted. And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made that runs the number of hours, the number of days. 5,000 days without interruption \u2014 that's just unbelievable. And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days; the Web is only 5,000 days. So, I was trying to basically make measurements. What are the dimensions of this machine? And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are all around the globe on all the computers. And there is a 100 billion clicks per day. And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions, and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer, talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless? Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell, but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet, if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet. There's two million emails per second. So it's a very big number. It's just a huge machine, and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet. So here's the specifications, just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it: 170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links, emails running at two megahertz itself, 31 kilohertz text messaging, 246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk. That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM. And the total traffic on this is running at seven terabytes per second. Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes. So every second, half of the Library of Congress is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day, 55 trillion links is almost the same as the number of synapses in your brain. A quadrillion transistors is almost the same as the number of neurons in your brain. So to a first approximation, we have these things \u2014 twenty petahertz synapse firings. Of course, the memory is really huge. But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size \u2014 and its complexity, kind of \u2014 to your brain. Because in fact, that's how your brain works \u2014 in kind of the same way that the Web works. However, your brain isn't doubling every two years. So if we say this machine right now that we've made is about one HB, one human brain, if we look at the rate that this is increasing, 30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs. So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine will exceed a total processing power of humanity,in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross. So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things. I have three kind of general things I would like to say, three consequences of this. First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying. We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next 5,000 days \u2014 we're going to give this machine a body. And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture. And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.So let me go through those three things. First of all, we have all these things in our hands. We think they're all separate devices, but in fact, every screen in the world is looking into the one machine. These are all basically portals into that one machine. The second thing is that \u2014 some people call this the cloud, and you're kind of touching the cloud with this. And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook. And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage. It's wireless. It's always connected. There's many things about it. It becomes very simple, and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine, you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way. So the machine is computing.And in some ways, it's sort of back to the kind of old idea of centralized computing. But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones, and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine. And everything will go through the Web. And we're seeing that already with, say, phones. Right now, phones don't go through the Web, but they are beginning to, and they will. And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah \u2014 all these things are going to become Web based. They're going through the machine. And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web. Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work, a Word document, they aren't on the Web, but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine. They're going to speak the Web language. They're going to talk to the machine. The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole that's sucking up everything into it. And so every thing will be part of the Web. So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it some little sliver of Web-ness and connection, and it will be part of this machine, so that our environment \u2014 kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense \u2014 our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.Now, with RFIDs and other things \u2014 whatever technology it is, it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine, and so we have, basically, an Internet of things. So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels, and a car as a chip with wheels, because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials. A lot of people think about the new economy as something that was going to be a disembodied, alternative, virtual existence, and that we would have the old economy of atoms. But in fact, what the new economy really is is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information, and the digital nature of things into the material world. That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going \u2014 this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.And so one of the consequences of that, I believe, is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now \u2014 TV, film, video \u2014 that basically becomes one media platform. And while there's many differences in some senses, they will share more and more in common with each other. So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value, the value's in the uncopiable things, the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization. The media wants to be liquid. The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them, not so that they are \"free\" as in \"beer,\" but \"free\" as in \"freedom.\" And the network effects rule, meaning that the more you have, the more you get. The first fax machine \u2014 the person who bought the first fax machine was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to. But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable. Those are the effects that we're going to see. Attention is the currency.So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media. And the other thing about this embodiment is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal. McLuhan was saying, \"Machines are the extensions of the human senses.\" And I'm saying, \"Humans are now going to be the extended senses of the machine,\" in a certain sense. So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches, through all our digital photographs and cameras. And we see that in things like Flickr, or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it. In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring, that what the Web is doing is restructuring. And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is \u2014 I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a \"semantic Web.\"So first of all, the first stage that we've seen of the Internet was that it was going to link computers. And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets. And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world. And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors, and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it, you connected it from one computer to another computer. And what you had to do was \u2014 if you wanted to participate in this, you had to share packets of information. So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control. It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line: you had to share packets.The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages. So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page, I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer. Now we have pages \u2014 the unit has been resolved into pages, so one page links to another page. And if I want to go in to book a flight, I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline, and I'm linking to that page. And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links. You couldn't deny \u2014 if someone wanted to link to you, you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody. So that's what we were doing.We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about, and that is where we link the data. So, I don't know what the name of this thing is. I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data. So we're going from machine to machine, from page to page, and now data to data. So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page, we're actually going to link from one idea on a page to another idea, rather than to the other page. So every idea is basically being supported \u2014 or every item, or every noun \u2014 is being supported by the entire Web. It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want. So besides physically coming out again into this idea that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things. So something will resolve down to the information about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID. Every person, every item will have a something that will be very specific, and will link to a specific representation of that idea or item. So now, in this new one, when I link to it, I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat. And so, giving an example of this thing, I live in Pacifica, rather than \u2014 right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere. The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town, and that it's a specific town that I live in, but that's what we're going to be talking about. It's going to link directly to \u2014 it will know, the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place, and that whenever it sees that word, \"Pacifica,\" it knows that it actually has a place, latitude, longitude, a certain population.So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things, that you'll see a lot more of. All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data. So I'll give you one kind of an example. There's like a billion social sites on the Web. Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are. Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once, and it should know who all your friends are. So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified, and you should just carry these relationships around. All this data about you should just be conveyed, and you should do it once and that's all that should happen. And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data. That's what we're moving into \u2014 where it sort of knows these things down to that level. A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph \u2014 we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing. But what's it's doing is sharing data. So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step than just sharing your Web page, or your computer. And all these things that are going to be on this are not just pages, they are things. Everything we've described, every artifact or place, will be a specific representation, will have a specific character that can be linked to directly. So we have this database of things. And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to, that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days, but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things \u2014 where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane \u2014 that that physical thing becomes part of the Web. And so we are in the middle of this thing that's completely linked, down to every object in the little sliver of a connection that it has.So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea that we're going to be codependent. It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better. If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history. And I found out by looking at it that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning. So I am open, and being transparent to that. And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency. That is going to be the price. If you want to have total personalization, you have to be totally transparent. Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google. We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point where I don't even try to remember things \u2014 I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that. And we kind of object at first, saying, \"Oh, that's awful.\" But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology, called the alphabet, and writing, we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture. We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing. And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves without this other machine being there. And what is happening with this is some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI, as being an expert, Larry Page told me that that's what they're trying to do, and that's what they're trying to do. But when six billion humans are Googling, who's searching who? It goes both ways. So we are the Web, that's what this thing is. We are going to be the machine. So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better. Just like it wasn't TV and only better. The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better \u2014 it's going to be something different. And I think it's going to be smarter. It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious. But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense. Secondly, it's become much more personalized. It will know us, and that's good. And again, the price of that will be transparency. And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it. And all these devices will be portals into that.So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just \"the Web, only better,\" but a new kind of stage in this development. It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts. But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism. So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a \"One.\" And I don't know what else to call it, than the One. We'll have a better word for it. But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge. And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is.So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say: there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS. All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web. To share is to gain. Let the One read it. It's going to be machine-readable. You want to make something that the machine can read. And the One is us. We are in the One. I appreciate your time.

You're a wild-eyed optimist.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nAnd yet it's here.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThe other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nas I looked at what even Wired was talking about,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nwe thought it was going to be TV, but better.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nThat was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nwas going to be coming.\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nAnd it turns out that that's not what it was.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nFirst of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nAnd so one of the things that I think we're learning --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nif you think about, like, Wikipedia,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nit's something that was simply impossible.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd if you take all these things that are impossible,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nI think one of the things that we're learning from this era,\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nfrom this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nbecause we're unprepared for it.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nSo, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBut if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhat's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nSo, I have a kind of a simple story,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthis thing that has happened in 5,000 days --\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nthat's all these computers, all these handhelds,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nall these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nbasically what we're getting out of all these connections\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nis we're getting one machine.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nIf there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nare actually just little windows into those machines,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nbut that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd so I began to think about that.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd it turned out that this machine happens to be\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthe most reliable machine that we've ever made.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nIt has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd there's almost no other machine that we've ever made\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthat runs the number of hours, the number of days.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nAnd of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nthe Web is only 5,000 days.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo, I was trying to basically make measurements.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nWhat are the dimensions of this machine?\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nAnd I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nall around the globe on all the computers.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd there is a 100 billion clicks per day.\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\ntalking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWell, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nbut there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nif you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nThere's two million emails per second.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nSo it's a very big number.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nIt's just a huge machine,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nSo here's the specifications,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\njust as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:10.958\n170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nemails running at two megahertz itself,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n31 kilohertz text messaging,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\n246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThat's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nAnd the total traffic on this\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nis running at seven terabytes per second.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBrewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nSo every second, half of the Library of Congress\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nis swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nSo I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\n55 trillion links is almost the same\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nas the number of synapses in your brain.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nA quadrillion transistors is almost the same\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nas the number of neurons in your brain.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nSo to a first approximation, we have these things --\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\ntwenty petahertz synapse firings.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nOf course, the memory is really huge.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nBut to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBecause in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nHowever, your brain isn't doubling every two years.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo if we say this machine right now that we've made\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nis about one HB, one human brain,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nif we look at the rate that this is increasing,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\n30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nSo by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nwill exceed a total processing power of humanity,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nin raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nRay Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nSo, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI have three kind of general things\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nI would like to say, three consequences of this.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nFirst, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWe're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nin the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nSo let me go through those three things.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nFirst of all, we have all these things in our hands.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nWe think they're all separate devices,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nbut in fact, every screen in the world\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nis looking into the one machine.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThese are all basically portals into that one machine.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nThe second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nand you're kind of touching the cloud with this.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nIt's wireless. It's always connected.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThere's many things about it. It becomes very simple,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nand basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nyou're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nSo the machine is computing.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nAnd in some ways, it's sort of back\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nto the kind of old idea of centralized computing.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nBut everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand the sensors in cars\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nand everything is connected to this machine.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd everything will go through the Web.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nAnd we're seeing that already with, say, phones.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nRight now, phones don't go through the Web,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nbut they are beginning to, and they will.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nin terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nall these things are going to become Web based.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nThey're going through the machine.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nRight now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\na Word document, they aren't on the Web,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nbut they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nThey're going to speak the Web language.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nThey're going to talk to the machine.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThe Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nthat's sucking up everything into it.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nAnd so every thing will be part of the Web.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nsome little sliver of Web-ness and connection,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand it will be part of this machine,\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nso that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nour environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNow, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nit doesn't really matter. The point is that everything\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nwill have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand so we have, basically, an Internet of things.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand a car as a chip with wheels,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nbecause basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nis the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nA lot of people think about the new economy\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nas something that was going to be a disembodied,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nalternative, virtual existence,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nand that we would have the old economy of atoms.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nBut in fact, what the new economy really is\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nand the digital nature of things into the material world.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nThat's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nthis union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nAnd so one of the consequences of that, I believe,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nis that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nTV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nAnd while there's many differences in some senses,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthey will share more and more in common with each other.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nthe value's in the uncopiable things,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthe immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nThe media wants to be liquid.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThe reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nnot so that they are \"free\" as in \"beer,\" but \"free\" as in \"freedom.\"\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd the network effects rule,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nmeaning that the more you have, the more you get.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThe first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nwas an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut here she became an evangelist, recruiting others\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nto get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nThose are the effects that we're going to see.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAttention is the currency.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAnd the other thing about this embodiment\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nis that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nMcLuhan was saying, \"Machines are the extensions of the human senses.\"\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd I'm saying, \"Humans are now going to be\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nthe extended senses of the machine,\" in a certain sense.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthrough all our digital photographs and cameras.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd we see that in things like Flickr,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nor Photosynth, this program from Microsoft\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nthat will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nfrom the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIn a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nNow, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat what the Web is doing is restructuring.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nAnd I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nI'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a \"semantic Web.\"\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSo first of all, the first stage that we've seen\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nof the Internet was that it was going to link computers.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nAnd if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nand there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nyou connected it from one computer to another computer.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nyou had to share packets of information.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nSo you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIt wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nyou had to share packets.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nThe second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nSo in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nNow we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nso one page links to another page.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd if I want to go in to book a flight,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nand I'm linking to that page.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nYou couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nyou couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nof opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo that's what we were doing.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nWe're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand that is where we link the data.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo, I don't know what the name of this thing is.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nI'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nSo we're going from machine to machine,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nfrom page to page, and now data to data.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nSo the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nwe're actually going to link from one idea on a page\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nto another idea, rather than to the other page.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo every idea is basically being supported --\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nor every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nIt's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo besides physically coming out again into this idea\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nthat it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo something will resolve down to the information\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nabout a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nEvery person, every item will have a something\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nthat will be very specific, and will link\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nto a specific representation of that idea or item.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nSo now, in this new one, when I link to it,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nI would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd so, giving an example of this thing,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nI live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nThe Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand that it's a specific town that I live in,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nbut that's what we're going to be talking about.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIt's going to link directly to --\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nit will know, the Web will be able to read itself\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nand know that that actually is a place,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nand that whenever it sees that word, \"Pacifica,\"\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nit knows that it actually has a place,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nlatitude, longitude, a certain population.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nSo here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nthat you'll see a lot more of.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nAll these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo I'll give you one kind of an example.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThere's like a billion social sites on the Web.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nEach time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand all your friends are.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWhy should you be doing that? You should just do that once,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand it should know who all your friends are.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nSo that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nand you should just carry these relationships around.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nAll this data about you should just be conveyed,\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand you should do it once and that's all that should happen.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nAnd you should have all the networks\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nof all the relationships between those pieces of data.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThat's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nA semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nwe're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nBut what's it's doing is sharing data.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthan just sharing your Web page, or your computer.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nAnd all these things that are going to be on this\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nare not just pages, they are things.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nEverything we've described, every artifact or place,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwill be a specific representation,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nwill have a specific character that can be linked to directly.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nSo we have this database of things.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nAnd so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nthat we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbut I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthat that physical thing becomes part of the Web.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd so we are in the middle of this thing\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthat's completely linked, down to every object\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nin the little sliver of a connection that it has.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nSo, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nthat we're going to be codependent.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nIt's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nIf you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nAnd I found out by looking at it\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthat I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nSo I am open, and being transparent to that.\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThat is going to be the price.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nIf you want to have total personalization,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nyou have to be totally transparent.\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nGoogle. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nWe're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nwhere I don't even try to remember things --\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nI'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd we kind of object at first, saying, \"Oh, that's awful.\"\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nBut if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\ncalled the alphabet, and writing,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nwe're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nWe cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nAnd so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nwithout this other machine being there.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd what is happening with this is\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nsome kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nas being an expert, Larry Page told me\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nthat that's what they're trying to do,\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nand that's what they're trying to do.\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nBut when six billion humans are Googling,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nwho's searching who? It goes both ways.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo we are the Web, that's what this thing is.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nWe are going to be the machine.\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nSo the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nJust like it wasn't TV and only better.\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nThe next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:28.958\nbut only better -- it's going to be something different.\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nAnd I think it's going to be smarter.\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:36.958\nIt'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.\n\n00:17:36.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nBut it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nSecondly, it's become much more personalized.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nIt will know us, and that's good.\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd again, the price of that will be transparency.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nin terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nAnd all these devices will be portals into that.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nSo the single idea that I wanted to leave with you\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nis that we have to begin to think about this as not just \"the Web, only better,\"\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nbut a new kind of stage in this development.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nIt looks more global. If you take this whole thing,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nit is a very big machine, very reliable machine,\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nmore reliable than its parts.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nBut we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nSo we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nmore as if this wasn't a large organism\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:33.958\nthat we are going to be interacting with. It's a \"One.\"\n\n00:18:33.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nAnd I don't know what else to call it, than the One.\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nWe'll have a better word for it.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nBut there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nAnd again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nI want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nor a volvox, which is what that organism is.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:54.958\nSo, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:\n\n00:18:54.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nthere's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nAll screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nTo share is to gain. Let the One read it.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nIt's going to be machine-readable.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nYou want to make something that the machine can read.\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nAnd the One is us. We are in the One.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nI appreciate your time.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A computer that works like the brain", "duration": "982", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/kwabena_boahen_on_a_computer_that_works_like_the_brain", "transcript": "I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra, and it was a really cool device. You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC. And I was fascinated. So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work. I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory, the RAM and the ALU, the arithmetic and logic unit. And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system.But nobody was really worried about this. When computers were first introduced, they were said to be a million times faster than neurons. People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip the capacity of the brain. This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing: \"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person.\" This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true. And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now, is that we pay a huge price for the speed that we claim is a big advantage of these computers. Let's take a look at some numbers. This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world. It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second. That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power. So that would be really great, if you could add that to the production capacity in Tanzania. It would really boost the economy. Just to go back to the States, if you translate the amount of power or electricity this computer uses to the amount of households in the States, you get 1,200 households in the U.S. That's how much power this computer uses.Now, let's compare this with the brain. This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain. Rory is a graduate student at Stanford. He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned. (Laughter) So that's true love, right there. Now, how much computation does the brain do? I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second, which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does. So that's the question. The question is, how much \u2014 they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data \u2014 the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use? And it's actually as much as your laptop computer: it's just 10 watts. So what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses, the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency? And let me just summarize. So the bottom line: the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have. How is the brain able to do this? Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work. So, this clip is from the PBS series, \"The Secret Life of the Brain.\" It shows you these cells that process information. They are called neurons. They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other, and where they contact each other, those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other. That process is called a synapse. You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other \u2014 about 100 million of them, sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second. And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.How does that compare with the way computers work? In the computer, you have all the data going through the central processing unit, and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck, whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons, and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here. It's really a network in the literal sense of the word. The net is doing the work in the brain. If you just look at these two pictures, these kind of words pop into your mind. This is serial and it's rigid \u2014 it's like cars on a freeway, everything has to happen in lockstep \u2014 whereas this is parallel and it's fluid. Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno: \"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.\" (Laughter) Brian actually said this in 1995. And nobody was listening then, but now people are beginning to listen because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face. And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.This is \u2014 it's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute in computers, and the devices that our brains use to compute. The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor. This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current from the source to the drain \u2014 these two electrodes. And that current, electrical current, is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on. And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate, you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current. And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device. Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one, and the absence of current to represent a zero.Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller, they no longer behave like this. In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute, which is called an ion channel. And this is a little protein molecule. I mean, neurons have thousands of these. And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it. And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore. Now, this pore can open and close. But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady \u2014 it's a sporadic flow of current. And even when you close the pore \u2014 which neurons can do, they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity \u2014 even when it's closed, because these ions are so small, they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time. So, what you have is that when the pore is open, you get some current sometimes. These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in. And when it's closed, you have a zero, but you have a few ones thrown in.Now, this is starting to happen in transistors. And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 \u2014 the technology that we are using \u2014 a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side. In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way. And that means that a transistor corresponds to about 12 ion channels in parallel. Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much. This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip. Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte of stuff on them \u2014 before, it was 256. Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen, and technology has really benefitted from that.But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small, that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel, and that corresponds to a single ion channel. And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel. The current will turn on and off at random, even when it's supposed to be on. And that means your computer is going to get its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.So, we are at the stage where we don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices. And the only kind of thing \u2014 the only thing we know right now that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory, it sends it into the processor or the ALU, and then it puts the result back into memory. That's the red path that's highlighted. The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons. And the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons. So you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network. And then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity, just by it flowing through the network. So you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern.What you see here is that there's these redundant connections. So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered, it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections. So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up, there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information. It makes the brain inherently robust. What you have here is a system where you store data locally. And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless, otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.What I want to basically talk about is my dream, which is to build a computer that works like the brain. This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years. And I'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina, which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball. We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer. In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet. They want to compress the information \u2014 they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on \u2014 and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain.Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina. And they figured out all the different cells, and they figured out the network, and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip. So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip, and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors. And these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain. It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like. The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here. And the chip \u2014 I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip. Let me explain what you're going to see, OK, because it's putting out different kinds of information, it's not as straightforward as a camera. The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information. It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red. And it extracts regions with white or light contrast, which will show up on the video as green.This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here. And then it also extracts movement. When Kareem moves his head to the right, you will see this blue activity there; it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image, that's where it's going from dark to light. And you also see this yellow activity, which represents regions where contrast is decreasing; it's going from light to dark. And these four types of information \u2014 your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it, and 900,000 of those fibers send these four types of information. So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.What you notice here is that these snapshots taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right? It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background, only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on. And this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse, because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing, and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.But the point that I want to make \u2014 I'll show you up here. So this image here is going to look like these ones, but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image, so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there. And so, here you go. Yes, so that's the idea. When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts. But when it's moving back and forth, the retina picks up these changes. And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here and something happens in your background, you merely move your eyes to it. There are these cells that detect change and you move your attention to it. So those are very important for catching somebody who's trying to sneak up on you.Let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put Africa in a piano, OK. This is a steel drum here that has been modified, and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano. And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer, and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that. Thank you. (Applause)Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena. Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing, the future of Africa, this conference \u2014 what connections can we make, if any, between them?Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning, I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra. And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it. It was very brute force; it was very inelegant. I don't think that I would've had that reaction, if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction, hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just \u2014 you know, buying into this hype about computers. I was coming at it from a different perspective, where I was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem. And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective, and I think that's going to impact technology. And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve. And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion, to come up with new things, because you're coming from a different perspective. I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 320, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nI got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nand it was a really cool device.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nYou could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nAnd I was fascinated.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nSo I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nI read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nbetween the memory, the RAM and the ALU,\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nthe arithmetic and logic unit.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nAnd I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.958\njust to keep all this data moving through the system.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nBut nobody was really worried about this.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nWhen computers were first introduced,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nthey were said to be a million times faster than neurons.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nPeople were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nthe capacity of the brain.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nThis is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\n\"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nas to ask a person.\"\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nThis was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nAnd so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nthis kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nWhat people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nis that we pay a huge price for the speed\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nthat we claim is a big advantage of these computers.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nLet's take a look at some numbers.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nThis is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\n10 quadrillion bits of information per second.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThat's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo that would be really great, if you could add that\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nto the production capacity in Tanzania.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nIt would really boost the economy.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nJust to go back to the States,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nif you translate the amount of power or electricity\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthis computer uses to the amount of households in the States,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nyou get 1,200 households in the U.S.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nThat's how much power this computer uses.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nNow, let's compare this with the brain.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nThis is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nRory is a graduate student at Stanford.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nHe studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nthis is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nSo that's true love, right there.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, how much computation does the brain do?\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nI estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nwhich is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nSo that's the question. The question is, how much --\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthey are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthe question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd it's actually as much as your laptop computer:\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nit's just 10 watts.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nSo what we are doing right now with computers\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwith the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthe brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nSo the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nAnd let me just summarize. So the bottom line:\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthe brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nthan we do right now with this computer technology that we have.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nHow is the brain able to do this?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nLet's just take a look about how the brain works,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand then I'll compare that with how computers work.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nSo, this clip is from the PBS series, \"The Secret Life of the Brain.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nIt shows you these cells that process information.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nThey are called neurons.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThey send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand where they contact each other, those little pulses\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nof electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThat process is called a synapse.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nYou've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nabout 100 million of them,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nsending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nHow does that compare with the way computers work?\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nIn the computer, you have all the data\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ngoing through the central processing unit,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nwhereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand the data just really flows through a network of connections\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\namong the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt's really a network in the literal sense of the word.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nThe net is doing the work in the brain.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nIf you just look at these two pictures,\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthese kind of words pop into your mind.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThis is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\neverything has to happen in lockstep --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhereas this is parallel and it's fluid.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nInformation processing is very dynamic and adaptive.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\n\"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.\"\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nBrian actually said this in 1995.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAnd nobody was listening then,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nbut now people are beginning to listen\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nbecause there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nThis is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nbetween the devices that we use to compute in computers,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand the devices that our brains use to compute.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThe devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nThis electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nfrom the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAnd that current, electrical current,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nis carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nyou get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nAnd when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nYour computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nand the absence of current to represent a zero.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nNow, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthey no longer behave like this.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nIn fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhich is called an ion channel.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd this is a little protein molecule.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nI mean, neurons have thousands of these.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd these are individual potassium ions\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat are flowing through that pore.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nNow, this pore can open and close.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nBut, when it's open, because these ions have to line up\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nand flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nit's a sporadic flow of current.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthey can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:23.958\neven when it's closed, because these ions are so small,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthey can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nSo, what you have is that when the pore is open,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nyou get some current sometimes.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThese are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd when it's closed, you have a zero,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nbut you have a few ones thrown in.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nNow, this is starting to happen in transistors.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nthe technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nthat several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nIn fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nAnd that means that a transistor corresponds\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nto about 12 ion channels in parallel.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nThis is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nOr your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nof stuff on them -- before, it was 256.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nTransistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nand technology has really benefitted from that.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nBut what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat it corresponds to only one electron at a time\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\ncan flow through that channel,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand that corresponds to a single ion channel.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThe current will turn on and off at random,\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\neven when it's supposed to be on.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nAnd that means your computer is going to get\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nits ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo, we are at the stage where we\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\ndon't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nthat can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nOK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit sends it into the processor or the ALU,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand then it puts the result back into memory.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nThat's the red path that's highlighted.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nAnd the way they represent information is\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthey break up that data into little pieces\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthat are represented by pulses and different neurons.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nSo you have all these pieces of data\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\ndistributed throughout the network.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd then the way that you process that data to get a result\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nis that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.958\njust by it flowing through the network.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nSo you set up these connections\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nsuch that the input pattern just flows\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nand generates the output pattern.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nWhat you see here is that there's these redundant connections.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nSo if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nit doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nwith these redundant connections.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nSo even when you go to these crappy devices\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nwhere sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthere's redundancy in the network\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nthat can actually recover the missing information.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nIt makes the brain inherently robust.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWhat you have here is a system where you store data locally.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nAnd it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\notherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nthat stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nWhat I want to basically talk about is my dream,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhich is to build a computer that works like the brain.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nThis is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd I'm going to show you a system that we designed\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto model the retina,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwhich is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIn fact, the processing that happens\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nin that little piece of brain is very similar\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nto the kind of processing that computers\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\ndo when they stream video over the Internet.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nThey want to compress the information --\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthey just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nand that is how your eyeball\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nis able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nto send to the rest of the brain.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nInstead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwe went and talked to neurobiologists\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwho have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd they figured out all the different cells,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand they figured out the network, and we just took that network\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nand the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nAnd these transistors are behaving essentially\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\njust like ion channels behave in the brain.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nIt will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nHere is actually what our artificial eye looks like.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThe retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd the chip -- I'm going to show you a video\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nthat the silicon retina put out of its output\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nwhen it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nwho's the student who designed this chip.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nLet me explain what you're going to see, OK,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nbecause it's putting out different kinds of information,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nit's not as straightforward as a camera.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThe retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nIt extracts regions with dark contrast,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nwhich will show up on the video as red.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd it extracts regions with white or light contrast,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nwhich will show up on the video as green.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nThis is Kareem's dark eyes\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand that's the white background that you see here.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd then it also extracts movement.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nWhen Kareem moves his head to the right,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nyou will see this blue activity there;\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nit represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat's where it's going from dark to light.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nAnd you also see this yellow activity,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwhich represents regions where contrast is decreasing;\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nit's going from light to dark.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nAnd these four types of information --\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nyour optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand 900,000 of those fibers\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nsend these four types of information.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nSo we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nWhat you notice here is that these snapshots\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\ntaken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nIt doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nonly on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nAnd this is the same thing you see\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nwhen people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nbecause that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nBut the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nSo this image here is going to look like these ones,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nbut here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nso, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd so, here you go.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nYes, so that's the idea.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nWhen you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nBut when it's moving back and forth,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nthe retina picks up these changes.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nAnd that's why, you know, when you're sitting here\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nand something happens in your background,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nyou merely move your eyes to it.\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nThere are these cells that detect change\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nand you move your attention to it.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nSo those are very important for catching somebody\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwho's trying to sneak up on you.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nLet me just end by saying that this is what happens\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwhen you put Africa in a piano, OK.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nThis is a steel drum here that has been modified,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nand that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nAnd what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand come up with a new kind of computer\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nThank you.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nChris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nDo you put together in your mind the work you're doing,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthe future of Africa, this conference --\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nwhat connections can we make, if any, between them?\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nKwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nI got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nAnd I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nIt was very brute force; it was very inelegant.\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nI don't think that I would've had that reaction,\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nif I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nhearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nbuying into this hype about computers.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nI was coming at it from a different perspective,\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nwhere I was bringing that different perspective\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nto bear on the problem.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nAnd I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nand I think that's going to impact technology.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nAnd that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nAnd I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nto come up with new things,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nbecause you're coming from a different perspective.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nI think we can contribute.

It ties to origami. So let me start. What is origami? Most people think they know what origami is. It's this: flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing. And that is what origami used to be. But it's become something else. It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.The common theme \u2014 what makes it origami \u2014 is folding is how we create the form. You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797. It shows these women playing with these toys. If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane. Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane. So this art has been around for hundreds of years, and you would think something that's been around that long \u2014 so restrictive, folding only \u2014 everything that could be done has been done a long time ago. And that might have been the case.But in the twentieth century, a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along, and he created tens of thousands of new designs. But even more importantly, he created a language, a way we could communicate, a code of dots, dashes and arrows. Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk, we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection, and we know where that leads. And where it has led in origami is to things like this. This is an origami figure \u2014 one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds. This, too, is origami, and this shows where we've gone in the modern world. Naturalism. Detail. You can get horns, antlers \u2014 even, if you look close, cloven hooves.And it raises a question: what changed? And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art, which is math. That is, people applied mathematical principles to the art, to discover the underlying laws. And that leads to a very powerful tool. The secret to productivity in so many fields \u2014 and in origami \u2014 is letting dead people do your work for you.(Laughter)Because what you can do is take your problem, and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved, and use their solutions. And I want to tell you how we did that in origami. Origami revolves around crease patterns. The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure. And you can't just draw them arbitrarily. They have to obey four simple laws. And they're very simple, easy to understand. The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting. The directions of the folds at any vertex \u2014 the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds \u2014 always differs by two. Two more or two less. Nothing else. If you look at the angles around the fold, you find that if you number the angles in a circle, all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line, all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line. And if you look at how the layers stack, you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets, a sheet can never penetrate a fold. So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami. All of origami comes from that.And you'd think, \"Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity?\" But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin, and yet they govern all of chemistry, all of life, all of history. If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things. So in origami, to obey these laws, we can take simple patterns \u2014 like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures \u2014 and by itself it's nothing. But if we follow the laws of origami, we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very, very simple, but when we put it together, we get something a little different. This fish, 400 scales \u2014 again, it is one uncut square, only folding. And if you don't want to fold 400 scales, you can back off and just do a few things, and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes. Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag, with 13 stripes. And if you want to go really crazy, 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake. And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance.The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures. And I can put it in this simple equation. We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.(Laughter)What matters is what we mean by those symbols. And you might say, \"Can you really be that specific? I mean, a stag beetle \u2014 it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?\" And yeah, you really can. So how do we do that? Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps. So let me stretch out that equation. I start with my idea. I abstract it. What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure. And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject, a flap for every leg. And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base, you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them, you can turn it into the finished shape.Now the first step, pretty easy. Take an idea, draw a stick figure. The last step is not so hard, but that middle step \u2014 going from the abstract description to the folded shape \u2014 that's hard. But that's the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump. And I'm going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something. But we're going to start small. This base has a lot of flaps in it. We're going to learn how to make one flap. How would you make a single flap? Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap. I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.What paper went into that flap? Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern, you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap. So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over. I can use it for something else. Well, there are other ways of making a flap. There are other dimensions for flaps. If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper. If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed. And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap. There's other ways of making flaps. If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper. And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle. So, no matter how I make a flap, it needs some part of a circular region of paper. So now we're ready to scale up. What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps? What do I need? I need a lot of circles.And in the 1990s, origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles. And here's where the dead people start to help us out, because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles. I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements. And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes. So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles, you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules. That gives you the folds. Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base. You get a folded shape \u2014 in this case, a cockroach. And it's so simple.(Laughter)It's so simple that a computer could do it. And you say, \"Well, you know, how simple is that?\" But computers \u2014 you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this, we could. So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website. It's free. It runs on all the major platforms \u2014 even Windows.(Laughter)And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern. It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed \u2014 which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers \u2014 you'll get this crease pattern. And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines, you'll get a base that you can then shape into a deer, with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted. And if you want a different deer, not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk, you change the packing, and you can do an elk. Or you could do a moose. Or, really, any other kind of deer. These techniques revolutionized this art. We found we could do insects, spiders, which are close, things with legs, things with legs and wings, things with legs and antennae. And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn't interesting enough, then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square. She's eating him. I call it \"Snack Time.\"And you can do more than just insects. This \u2014 you can put details, toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws. This tree frog has toes. Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models. Toes have become an origami meme, because everyone's doing it. You can make multiple subjects. So these are a couple of instrumentalists. The guitar player from a single square, the bass player from a single square. And if you say, \"Well, but the guitar, bass \u2014 that's not so hot. Do a little more complicated instrument.\" Well, then you could do an organ.(Laughter)And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand. So now people can say, \"I want exactly this and this and this,\" and you can go out and fold it. And sometimes you create high art, and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work. But I want to show you some examples. Everything you'll see here, except the car, is origami.(Video)(Applause)Just to show you, this really was folded paper. Computers made things move, but these were all real, folded objects that we made. And we can use this not just for visuals, but it turns out to be useful even in the real world. Surprisingly, origami and the structures that we've developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine, in science, in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.And I want to show you some of these examples. One of the earliest was this pattern, this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer. He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure. And he used it to design this solar array. It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995. Now, there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple. The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places. It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern \u2014 you wouldn't even call that origami. They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami. Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger. They called it the Eyeglass. The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens. So, imagine a lens the size of a football field. There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down. Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket. And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller. How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller? Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow. So you have to do something like this. This was a small model.Folded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures. But this pattern's not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters. So the Livermore engineers, wanting to make use of the work of dead people, or perhaps live origamists, said, \"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.\" So they looked into the origami community, we got in touch with them, and I started working with them. And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size, but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder. And they adopted that for their first generation, which was not 100 meters \u2014 it was a five-meter. But this is a five-meter telescope \u2014 has about a quarter-mile focal length. And it works perfectly on its test range, and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.Now, there is other origami in space. Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail, and you can see here that the sail expands out, and you can still see the fold lines. The problem that's being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination, but needs to be small for the journey. And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body. And this example is the latter. This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University. It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination, but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there, through your blood vessels. And this stent folds down using an origami pattern, based on a model called the water bomb base.Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space. And they want to do their design by simulation. So they need to figure out how, in a computer, to flatten an airbag. And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation. And so they can do a simulation like this. Those are the origami creases forming, and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out, does it work? And that leads to a really interesting idea.You know, where did these things come from? Well, the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school. It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base. The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects \u2014 things with legs. The thing is, that this often happens in math and science. When you get math involved, problems that you solve for aesthetic value only, or to create something beautiful, turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world. And as weird and surprising as it may sound, origami may someday even save a life.

So let me start.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nWhat is origami?\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nMost people think they know what origami is. It's this:\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nflapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\nAnd that is what origami used to be.\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nBut it's become something else.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nIt's become an art form, a form of sculpture.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nThe common theme -- what makes it origami --\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nis folding is how we create the form.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nYou know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nIt shows these women playing with these toys.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIf you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nEvery Japanese kid\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nlearns how to fold that crane.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nSo this art has been around for hundreds of years,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nand you would think something\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nthat's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\neverything that could be done has been done a long time ago.\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAnd that might have been the case.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nBut in the twentieth century,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\na Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nand he created tens of thousands of new designs.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nBut even more importantly, he created a language,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\na way we could communicate,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\na code of dots, dashes and arrows.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nHarkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nwe now have a means of transmitting information\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nwith heredity and selection,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nand we know where that leads.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAnd where it has led in origami\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nis to things like this.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nThis is an origami figure --\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\none sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nThis, too, is origami,\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand this shows where we've gone in the modern world.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nNaturalism. Detail.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nYou can get horns, antlers --\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\neven, if you look close, cloven hooves.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd it raises a question: what changed?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nAnd what changed is something\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nyou might not have expected in an art,\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nwhich is math.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThat is, people applied mathematical principles\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nto the art,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nto discover the underlying laws.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nAnd that leads to a very powerful tool.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nThe secret to productivity in so many fields --\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand in origami --\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nis letting dead people do your work for you.\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nBecause what you can do is\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\ntake your problem,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand use their solutions.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nAnd I want to tell you how we did that in origami.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nOrigami revolves around crease patterns.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nThe crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nfor an origami figure.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nAnd you can't just draw them arbitrarily.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nThey have to obey four simple laws.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd they're very simple, easy to understand.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nwith just two colors without ever having\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nthe same color meeting.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThe directions of the folds at any vertex --\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthe number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nalways differs by two. Two more or two less.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nNothing else.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nIf you look at the angles around the fold,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nyou find that if you number the angles in a circle,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nall the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nall the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nAnd if you look at how the layers stack,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nyou'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\na sheet can never\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\npenetrate a fold.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSo that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAll of origami comes from that.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd you'd think, \"Can four simple laws\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\ngive rise to that kind of complexity?\"\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBut indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\ncan be written down on a napkin,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand yet they govern all of chemistry,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nall of life, all of history.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nIf we obey these laws,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nwe can do amazing things.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nSo in origami, to obey these laws,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nwe can take simple patterns --\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nlike this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nand by itself it's nothing.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nBut if we follow the laws of origami,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nwe can put these patterns into another fold\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nthat itself might be something very, very simple,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nbut when we put it together,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nwe get something a little different.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis fish, 400 scales --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nagain, it is one uncut square, only folding.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd if you don't want to fold 400 scales,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nyou can back off and just do a few things,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nand add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOr you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\non a flag, with 13 stripes.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd if you want to go really crazy,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\n1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd this guy's on display downstairs,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nso take a look if you get a chance.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThe most powerful tools in origami\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nhave related to how we get parts of creatures.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I can put it in this simple equation.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nWe take an idea,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ncombine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nWhat matters is what we mean by those symbols.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nAnd you might say, \"Can you really be that specific?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nI mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nit's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?\"\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAnd yeah, you really can.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nSo how do we do that? Well, we break it down\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\ninto a few smaller steps.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nSo let me stretch out that equation.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nI start with my idea. I abstract it.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nWhat's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nthat has a part for every bit of the subject,\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\na flap for every leg.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nAnd then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nyou can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nyou can turn it into the finished shape.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nNow the first step, pretty easy.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nTake an idea, draw a stick figure.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThe last step is not so hard, but that middle step --\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\ngoing from the abstract description to the folded shape --\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat's hard.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBut that's the place where the mathematical ideas\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\ncan get us over the hump.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nAnd I'm going to show you all how to do that\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nso you can go out of here and fold something.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nBut we're going to start small.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nThis base has a lot of flaps in it.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nWe're going to learn how to make one flap.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nHow would you make a single flap?\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nTake a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nuntil it gets long and narrow,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nI could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nWhat paper went into that flap?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nWell, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nyou can see that the upper left corner of that shape\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nis the paper that went into the flap.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nSo that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nI can use it for something else.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nWell, there are other ways of making a flap.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThere are other dimensions for flaps.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nIf I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nIf I make the flap as skinny as possible,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nI get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThere's other ways of making flaps.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nIf I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo, no matter how I make a flap,\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nit needs some part\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nof a circular region of paper.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo now we're ready to scale up.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWhat do I need? I need a lot of circles.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd in the 1990s,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\norigami artists discovered these principles\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nand realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\njust by packing circles.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nAnd here's where the dead people start to help us out,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nbecause lots of people have studied\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nthe problem of packing circles.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nI can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nlooking at disc packings and arrangements.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nAnd I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nyou decorate the patterns of circles with lines\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\naccording to more rules. That gives you the folds.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThose folds fold into a base. You shape the base.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nYou get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd it's so simple.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nIt's so simple that a computer could do it.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nAnd you say, \"Well, you know, how simple is that?\"\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nBut computers -- you need to be able to describe things\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nin very basic terms, and with this, we could.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nSo I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\ncalled TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nIt's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd you just draw a stick figure,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nand it calculates the crease pattern.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nIt does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand if you use that stick figure that I just showed --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhich you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nyou'll get this crease pattern.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nyou'll get a base that you can then shape\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\ninto a deer,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwith exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nAnd if you want a different deer,\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nnot a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nyou change the packing,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand you can do an elk.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nOr you could do a moose.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nOr, really, any other kind of deer.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nThese techniques revolutionized this art.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nWe found we could do insects,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nspiders, which are close,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthings with legs, things with legs and wings,\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nthings with legs and antennae.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwasn't interesting enough,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nthen you could do two praying mantises\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nfrom a single uncut square.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nShe's eating him.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nI call it \"Snack Time.\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd you can do more than just insects.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThis -- you can put details,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.958\ntoes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nThis tree frog has toes.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nActually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nToes have become an origami meme,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nbecause everyone's doing it.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nYou can make multiple subjects.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nSo these are a couple of instrumentalists.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nThe guitar player from a single square,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthe bass player from a single square.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd if you say, \"Well, but the guitar, bass --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat's not so hot.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nDo a little more complicated instrument.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nWell, then you could do an organ.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nAnd what this has allowed is the creation\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof origami-on-demand.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nSo now people can say, \"I want exactly this and this and this,\"\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nand you can go out and fold it.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nAnd sometimes you create high art,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nBut I want to show you some examples.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nEverything you'll see here,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nexcept the car, is origami.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:44.958\n(Video)\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nJust to show you, this really was folded paper.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nComputers made things move,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nbut these were all real, folded objects that we made.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd we can use this not just for visuals,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nbut it turns out to be useful even in the real world.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nSurprisingly, origami\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand the structures that we've developed in origami\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nturn out to have applications in medicine, in science,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nin space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd I want to show you some of these examples.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nOne of the earliest was this pattern,\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nthis folded pattern,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nstudied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nHe studied a folding pattern, and realized\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nthis could fold down into an extremely compact package\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nthat had a very simple opening and closing structure.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd he used it to design this solar array.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nIt's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nin 1995.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nNow, there is actually a little origami\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nin the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nThe telescope, going up in space,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nit unfolds in two places.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nIt folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nyou wouldn't even call that origami.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nThey certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nBut if you want to go higher and go larger than this,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nthen you might need some origami.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nEngineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nhad an idea for a telescope much larger.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nThey called it the Eyeglass.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nThe design called for geosynchronous orbit\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n25,000 miles up,\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n100-meter diameter lens.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nSo, imagine a lens the size of a football field.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nThere were two groups of people who were interested in this:\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nplanetary scientists, who want to look up,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nand then other people, who wanted to look down.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nWhether you look up or look down,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nhow do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nHow do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nWell, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nSo you have to do something like this.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThis was a small model.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nFolded lens, you divide up the panels, you add flexures.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nBut this pattern's not going to work\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nto get something 100 meters down to a few meters.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSo the Livermore engineers,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nwanting to make use of the work of dead people,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nor perhaps live origamists, said,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\n\"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing.\"\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nSo they looked into the origami community,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nwe got in touch with them, and I started working with them.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nAnd we developed a pattern together\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat scales to arbitrarily large size,\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nbut that allows any flat ring or disc\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nto fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nAnd they adopted that for their first generation,\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwhich was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nBut this is a five-meter telescope --\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nhas about a quarter-mile focal length.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd it works perfectly on its test range,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nand it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nNow, there is other origami in space.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nJapan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nand you can see here that the sail expands out,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nand you can still see the fold lines.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThe problem that's being solved here is\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nsomething that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nbut needs to be small for the journey.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd that works whether you're going into space,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nor whether you're just going into a body.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd this example is the latter.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nThis is a heart stent developed by Zhong You\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nat Oxford University.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nIt holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nbut it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nthrough your blood vessels.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd this stent folds down using an origami pattern,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nbased on a model called the water bomb base.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nAirbag designers also have the problem\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nof getting flat sheets\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\ninto a small space.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd they want to do their design by simulation.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo they need to figure out how, in a computer,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nto flatten an airbag.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nAnd the algorithms that we developed\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nto do insects\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nturned out to be the solution for airbags\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nto do their simulation.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nAnd so they can do a simulation like this.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThose are the origami creases forming,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand now you can see the airbag inflate\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nand find out, does it work?\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd that leads\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nto a really interesting idea.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nYou know, where did these things come from?\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWell, the heart stent\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\ncame from that little blow-up box\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat you might have learned in elementary school.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nIt's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThe airbag-flattening algorithm\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\ncame from all the developments\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nof circle packing and the mathematical theory\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthat was really developed\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\njust to create insects -- things with legs.\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nThe thing is, that this often happens\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nin math and science.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nWhen you get math involved, problems that you solve\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nfor aesthetic value only,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nor to create something beautiful,\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nturn around and turn out\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nto have an application in the real world.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nAnd as weird and surprising as it may sound,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\norigami may someday even save a life.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nThanks.\n\n00:15:45.958 -->

For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators, such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road, to study things on the smallest scale. But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale. Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected. So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are \u2014 at least some of the big questions.So, recently, we have realized that the ordinary matter in the universe \u2014 and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me, the planets, the stars, the galaxies \u2014 the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent of the content of the universe. Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible. By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect. It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum, which is what we use to detect things. It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there? We know it's there by its gravitational effects. In fact, this dark matter dominates the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale, and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.What about the rest of the pie? The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy. More about that later, OK. So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter. In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this, most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy. This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy. So we have these stars going around in circles like this. As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK \u2014 that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK.So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside. In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance \u2014 this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK \u2014 we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy. When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance. If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see. In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter. And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves, and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy. So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.Galaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space; they tend to cluster. And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster. And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster. They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here. So these galaxy clusters \u2014 we take a snapshot now, we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical. But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds. They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK. So all of these galaxies are moving. We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities, and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.And again, what we find is that there is much more mass there than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see. Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well. But that cannot account for the mass either. In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter, OK. It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly. I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there. Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.And so let me lead you through how we can do this. So here's an observer: it could be an eye; it could be a telescope. And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe. How do we see that galaxy? A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye. Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is? Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right? We say, the ray of light came this way; the galaxy must be there, OK. Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies \u2014 and don't forget the dark matter, OK. Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this, we now need to take into account what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity. And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass, will deflect not only the trajectory of particles, but will deflect light itself.So this light ray will not continue in a straight line, but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye. Where will this observer see the galaxy? You can respond. Up, right? We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here. Is there any other ray of light that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy? Yes, great. I see people going down like this. So a ray of light could go down, be bent up into the observer's eye, and the observer sees a ray of light here.Now, take into account the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe, OK, a three-dimensional space. Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye? Yes! The rays would lie on a \u2014 I'd like to see \u2014 yeah, on a cone. So there's a whole ray of light \u2014 rays of light on a cone \u2014 that will all be bent by that cluster and make it into the observer's eye. If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see? A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK. Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line. If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.Now, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK, to figure out what that image will look like. Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise, that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect. We call this gravitational lensing. And so, this is your instrument, OK. (Laughter). But ignore the top part. It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK. So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop. We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK. So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing. And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper \u2014 I'm a physicist. (Laughter) So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle. And now put the lens over the galaxy, and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring. Now, move the base off to the side, and the ring will split up into arcs, OK. And you can put it on top of any image. On the graph paper, you can see how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted. And again, this is a kind of an accurate model of what happens with the gravitational lensing.OK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky? Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies? And the answer is yes. And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Many of the images you are seeing are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope. Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies \u2014 those are the galaxies in the cluster. They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter that are causing the bending of the light to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically, of the background galaxies. So the streaks that you see, all these streaks, are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.So what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster. And it's an enormous amount of mass. And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this, that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies. They are centered on some more spread out structure, and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded, OK. So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.OK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following. So the evidence that we have that a quarter of the universe is dark matter \u2014 this gravitationally attracting stuff \u2014 is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter. And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.OK. So now, let's turn to dark energy. So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session. And that is the fact that space itself is expanding. So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe \u2014 and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK \u2014 and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures, so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure, horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are. If you could do this, what you would find that with each passing day, each passing year, each passing billions of years, OK, the distance between galaxies is getting greater. And it's not because galaxies are moving away from each other through space. They're not necessarily moving through space. They're moving away from each other because space itself is getting bigger, OK. That's what the expansion of the universe or space means. So they're moving further apart.Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate. But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK. So the expansion slows down with time. So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again. So a little over a decade ago, two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down, OK. By how much less is it expanding today, compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?The startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments, was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago, OK. So the expansion of space is actually speeding up. This was a completely surprising result. There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK. No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found. It was the opposite of what was expected. So we need something to be able to explain that. Now it turns out, in the mathematics, you can put it in as a term that's an energy, but it's a completely different type of energy from anything we've ever seen before. We call it dark energy, and it has this effect of causing space to expand. But we don't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point, OK. So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.Now, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you, is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy are completely different things, OK. There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe, and they have very different effects. Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts, it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK. So clusters of galaxies will tend to form, because of all this gravitational attraction. Dark energy, on the other hand, is putting more and more space between the galaxies, makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease, and so it impedes the growth of structure. So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies, and how they \u2014 their number density, how many there are as a function of time \u2014 we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming.In terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any, you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy. Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes. We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter. Now, what do I mean by well motivated? I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK, things that I haven't even talked about, that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting, new particle.So, this is exactly what you want in physics: where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else. But we don't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate, OK. One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different. Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door. They just pass through anything. They can come through the building, through the Earth \u2014 they're so non-interacting.So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it. So a crystal that will ring if that happens. So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector. And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota, OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far. They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are. There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy, to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this. The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator, that we'll be turning on later this year. It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the Large Hadron Collider.Now, because they are so non-interactive, they will actually escape the detector, so their signature will be missing energy, OK. Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics whose signature could be missing energy, so it will be hard to tell the difference. And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy \u2014 ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy. So in terms of the big questions: what is dark matter? What is dark energy? The big questions facing physics. And I'm sure you have lots of questions, which I very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.

later, OK.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nIn these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nmost of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nThis huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo we have these stars going around in circles like this.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAs you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nthat stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nthan those that are further out here, OK.\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nSo what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nIn other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthis is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nwe would expect that it goes down as the distance increases\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nfrom the center of the galaxy.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nWhen those measurements are made,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\ninstead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nas a function of distance.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nIf it's constant, that means that the stars out here\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nare feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nIn fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nappears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nAnd this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nand it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nSo we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nthat's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nGalaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nthey tend to cluster.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nAnd there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThey're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nwe take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nBut these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThey're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nSo all of these galaxies are moving.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nWe can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand figure out how much mass is in this cluster.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd again, what we find is that there is much more mass there\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthan can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nOr if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwe see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nBut that cannot account for the mass either.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nIn fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nin the form of this invisible or dark matter\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nas there is in the ordinary matter, OK.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nto try to remind you that it's there.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nCan we see it more visually? Yes, we can.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd so let me lead you through how we can do this.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nSo here's an observer:\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nit could be an eye; it could be a telescope.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nHow do we see that galaxy?\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nA ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nfor perhaps billions of years\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nbefore it enters the telescope or your eye.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nNow, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nWell, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nas it enters our eye, right?\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nWe say, the ray of light came this way;\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nthe galaxy must be there, OK.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nNow, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand don't forget the dark matter, OK.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nNow, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nwe now need to take into account\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nwhat Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnd that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nwill deflect not only the trajectory of particles,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nbut will deflect light itself.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo this light ray will not continue in a straight line,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nbut would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWhere will this observer see the galaxy?\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nYou can respond. Up, right?\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nWe extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIs there any other ray of light\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nYes, great. I see people going down like this.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo a ray of light could go down, be bent\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nup into the observer's eye,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nand the observer sees a ray of light here.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNow, take into account the fact that we live in\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\na three-dimensional universe, OK,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\na three-dimensional space.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nAre there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nYes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nSo there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat will all be bent by that cluster\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand make it into the observer's eye.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nIf there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nA circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nNow, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nIf they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nNow, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nto figure out what that image will look like.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nBecause it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nthat has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWe call this gravitational lensing.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nAnd so, this is your instrument, OK.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.958\n(Laughter).\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nBut ignore the top part.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nIt's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nSo, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nI save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nWe shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nAnd so the next thing you need to do in your experiment\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nis grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd now put the lens over the galaxy,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nNow, move the base off to the side,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand the ring will split up into arcs, OK.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd you can put it on top of any image.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nOn the graph paper, you can see\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nhow all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nAnd again, this is a kind of an accurate model\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nof what happens with the gravitational lensing.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nOK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nDo we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nMany of the images you are seeing\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nare earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWell, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthose are the galaxies in the cluster.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nThey're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthat are causing the bending of the light\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nto cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nof the background galaxies.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo the streaks that you see, all these streaks,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nare actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nwe see in those images, we can calculate how much mass\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nthere must be in this cluster.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd it's an enormous amount of mass.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nAnd also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthat these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThey are centered on some more spread out structure,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand that is the dark matter\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nin which the cluster is embedded, OK.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nSo this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nat least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nOK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nSo the evidence that we have\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nthat a quarter of the universe is dark matter --\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthis gravitationally attracting stuff --\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nis that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nis much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nit must be embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nAnd we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthat say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nOK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthat Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd that is the fact that space itself is expanding.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nSo if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nso every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nhorizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nIf you could do this, what you would find\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nthat with each passing day, each passing year,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\neach passing billions of years, OK,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthe distance between galaxies is getting greater.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd it's not because galaxies are moving\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\naway from each other through space.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThey're not necessarily moving through space.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nThey're moving away from each other\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nbecause space itself is getting bigger, OK.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nThat's what the expansion of the universe or space means.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nSo they're moving further apart.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nNow, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nis that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nBut because gravitationally attracting matter\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nis embedded in this space,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nit tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nSo the expansion slows down with time.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo, in the last century, OK, people debated\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nabout whether this expansion of space would continue forever;\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhether it would slow down, you know,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nwill be slowing down, but continue forever;\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nslow down and stop, asymptotically stop;\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nor slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nSo a little over a decade ago,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.958\ntwo groups of physicists and astronomers\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nset out to measure the rate at which\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthe expansion of space was slowing down, OK.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nBy how much less is it expanding today,\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.958\ncompared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nwas that space is expanding at a faster rate today\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nthan it was a few billion years ago, OK.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nSo the expansion of space is actually speeding up.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThis was a completely surprising result.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThere is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nNo one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nIt was the opposite of what was expected.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nSo we need something to be able to explain that.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nNow it turns out, in the mathematics,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nyou can put it in as a term that's an energy,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nbut it's a completely different type of energy\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nfrom anything we've ever seen before.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nWe call it dark energy,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand it has this effect of causing space to expand.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nBut we don't have a good motivation\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nfor putting it in there at this point, OK.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nSo it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nNow, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nis that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nare completely different things, OK.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThere are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nand they have very different effects.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nDark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nit tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nSo clusters of galaxies will tend to form,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nbecause of all this gravitational attraction.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nDark energy, on the other hand,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nis putting more and more space between the galaxies,\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nmakes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand so it impedes the growth of structure.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nSo by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand how they -- their number density,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nhow many there are as a function of time --\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nwe can learn about how dark matter and dark energy\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\ncompete against each other in structure forming.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nIn terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nyou know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nDo we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nWe have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nNow, what do I mean by well motivated?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nI mean that we have mathematically consistent theories\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat were actually introduced\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nto explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nthings that I haven't even talked about,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat each predict the existence\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nof a very weakly interacting, new particle.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo, this is exactly what you want in physics:\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nwhere a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthat was actually developed for something else.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nBut we don't know if either of those\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nare actually the dark matter candidate, OK.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nOne or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nNow, we look for these dark matter particles\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nbecause, after all, they are here in the room, OK,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nand they didn't come in the door.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nThey just pass through anything.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThey can come through the building, through the Earth --\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthey're so non-interacting.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo one way to look for them is to build detectors\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nthat are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nSo a crystal that will ring if that happens.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nhave built such a detector.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nAnd they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nOK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nannounced the most sensitive results so far.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThey haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nand the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nThere's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nand it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nto see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nThe Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat we'll be turning on later this year.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nIt is possible that dark matter particles might be produced\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nat the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nNow, because they are so non-interactive,\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nthey will actually escape the detector,\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nso their signature will be missing energy, OK.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nNow, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nwhose signature could be missing energy,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nso it will be hard to tell the difference.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nAnd finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nspecifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nthat are in competition right now\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nto be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSo in terms of the big questions:\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nwhat is dark matter? What is dark energy?\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nThe big questions facing physics.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nAnd I'm sure you have lots of questions,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nwhich I very much look forward to addressing\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nover the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A family tree for humanity", "duration": "1253", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/spencer_wells_is_building_a_family_tree_for_all_humanity", "transcript": "Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks, as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing, checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on. And visiting some pretty incredible places, places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice \u2014 I was here a month ago.And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons. You see some incredible stuff. And you get to make these spot comparisons between people all around the globe. And the thing that you really take away from that, the kind of surface thing that you take away from it, is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that, but rather how different we are. There is so much diversity around the globe. 6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people, all different colors, shapes, sizes. You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that, and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species.How do we explain that diversity? Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today, is how we're using the tools of genetics, population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity, and how long it took. Now, the problem of human diversity, like all big scientific questions \u2014 how do you explain something like that \u2014 can be broken down into sub-questions. And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.First one is really a question of origins. Do we all share a common origin, in fact? And given that we do \u2014 and that's the assumption everybody, I think, in this room would make \u2014 when was that? When did we originate as a species? How long have we been divergent from each other?And the second question is related, but slightly different. If we do spring from a common source, how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe, and in the process generate all of this diversity, the different ways of life, the different appearances, the different languages around the world?Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology, seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago. In \"The Descent of Man,\" he wrote, \"In each great region of the world, the living mammals are closely related to the extinct species of the same region. It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee, and as these two species are now man's nearest allies, it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors lived on the African continent than elsewhere.\"So we're done, we can go home \u2014 finished the origin question. Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry, our common ancestry with apes. And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent. Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record. Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time, due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean. Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago, and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it. The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia, became the gibbons and the orangutans. And the ones that stayed on in Africa evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us. So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes, it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.But that's not really the question I'm asking. I'm asking about our human ancestry, things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the room. If they were peering over your shoulder, you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry? Because if we go far enough back, we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth. DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back \u2014 over a billion years. What we're asking about though is human ancestry. How do we study that?Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology. Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology \u2014 the way things are shaped, often skull shape \u2014 saying, \"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor. This must be who I'm directly descended from.\"The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists. What do I mean by that? You're looking at a great example here. These are three extinct species of hominids, potential human ancestors. All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family. And they're all dating to roughly the same time. From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and Australopithecus \u2014 now called Paranthropus boisei, the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time. That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor. Which one of these guys am I actually related to? Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently \u2014 again, largely skull shape. The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus, Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist, who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself to categorize every living organism on the planet. You think you've got a tough job? And he did a pretty good job. He categorized about 12,000 species in \"Systema Naturae.\" He actually coined the term Homo sapiens \u2014 it means wise man in Latin. But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said, \"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.\" And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans, and a blatantly racist category he termed \"Monstrosus,\" which basically included all the people he didn't like, including imaginary folk like elves.It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist working in the pre-Darwinian era. Except, if you had taken physical anthropology as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned basically that same classification of humanity. Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago \u2014 Carlton Coon is the best example \u2014 had been diverging from each other \u2014 this was in the post-Darwinian era \u2014 for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus. But based on what data? Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.Well, what I'm going to talk about today, what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem. Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry, digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors, and saying it on the basis of morphology \u2014 which we still don't completely understand, we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation \u2014what we need to do is turn the problem on its head. Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem, or a genealogical question. What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today. And as any genealogist will tell you \u2014 anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time? You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about. You and your siblings, you have a parent in common. You and your cousins share a grandparent in common. You gradually trace further and further back into the past, adding these ever more distant relationships. But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records, and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall. A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors, and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.Who were these people who came before? We have no written record. Well, actually, we do. Written in our DNA, in our genetic code \u2014 we have a historical document that takes us back in time to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.Now, a quick primer on DNA. I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist. It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint. It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them. And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint. How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length. A haploid genome \u2014 we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes \u2014 a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length. And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long. If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long. If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times. It's a lot of information.And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job. Imagine the longest book you can think of, \"War and Peace.\" Now multiply it by 100. And imagine copying that by hand. And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake \u2014 substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations. It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in. But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down through the generations, they become markers of descent. If you share a marker with someone, it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past, the person who first had that change in their DNA. And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation, the pattern of these markers in people all over the world, and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history, that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work. Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent. You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother, all the way back to the very first woman. The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men, traces a purely paternal line of descent. Everybody in this room, everybody in the world, falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees. Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees, they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them. Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree with the root at the bottom and the branches going up. What's the take-home message?Well, the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within Africa, among Africans. That means that Africans have been accumulating this mutational diversity for longer. And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA. Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa. And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.Now, how recently do we share this ancestry? Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world? No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person \u2014 Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her \u2014 in Africa, an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago. That's only about 2,000 human generations, the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family.Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier? Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species, or sub-species rather, human races around the world? Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently? Well, that's a big question. These \"why\" questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones, the ones that are tough to answer.And so when all else fails, talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago? Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago. It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago. Lots of evidence from sediment cores and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on. We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago, but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough, getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets. New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet \u2014 about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn \u2014 and there aren't a lot of glaciers here, except on the high mountains here in East Africa. So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa. Rather, Africa was drying out at that time. This is a paleo-climatological map of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.So the whole world was drying out. The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets, compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago, crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.And then something happened. A great illustration of it. Look at some stone tools. The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago. The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins, not our direct ancestors, living in Europe, and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago. Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists or physical anthropologists in the audience, basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups. The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right. We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The tool styles don't change that much. The evidence is that the human way of life didn't change that much during that period.But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species, at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language, syntactic language \u2014 subject, verb, object \u2014 that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded.This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa, and they allowed us to start to expand around the world. We've been talking at this conference about African success stories. Well, you want the ultimate African success story? Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa \u2014 probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now, around 60, 70 thousand years ago \u2014 allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago. A slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savannah hunters.So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like. And it's basically a meat locker. People who would have specialized in killing the animals, hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up, following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago, during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara. Migrating eastward, following the grasslands, because that's what they were adapted to live on.And when they reached Central Asia, they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway, a grassland super-highway. The grasslands at that time \u2014 this was during the last ice age \u2014 stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea, and the entire continent was open to them. Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago, and finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age \u2014 temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps \u2014 migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that, the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures, allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species. And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago in my book, \"The Journey of Man,\" and a film that we made with the same title. And as we were finishing up that film \u2014 it was co-produced with National Geographic \u2014 I started talking to the folks at NG about this work. And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said, \"You know, we really see this as kind of the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from, using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world. You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA, and we want to take it to the next level. What do you want to do next?\" Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.And I said, \"Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that. It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet. And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from, you know, a handful of populations around the world. Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map. We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more \u2014 hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.\"And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project. The project launched in April 2005. It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it. The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples. People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time retain a connection to the place where they live that many of the rest of us have lost. So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe. I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling. Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up. But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.That's the focus of the field research, the centers that we've set up all over the world \u2014 10 of them, top population geneticists. But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world. How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project? The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.In this case, you actually can. You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic. You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA. And you can actually submit those results to the database, and tell us a little about your genealogical background, have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise, after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components, gets plowed back into the project. The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund. It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world for educational, cultural projects initiated by them. They apply to this fund in order to do various projects, and I'll show you a couple of examples.So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world. The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago, which has raised around five million dollars, the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars. Projects around the world \u2014 documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone, preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza, language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc. So the project is going very, very well, and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.Thank you very much.

Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nour common ancestry with apes.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAround 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nAfrica was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\ndue to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nBumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nand then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nThe apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbecame the gibbons and the orangutans.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd the ones that stayed on in Africa\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nevolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nSo, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nit's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nBut that's not really the question I'm asking.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI'm asking about our human ancestry,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthings that we would recognize as being like us\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nif they were sitting here in the room.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIf they were peering over your shoulder,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nyou wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nBecause if we go far enough back,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwe share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nDNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nWhat we're asking about though is human ancestry.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nHow do we study that?\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWell, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nDigging things up out of the ground,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nand largely on the basis of morphology --\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nthe way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\n\"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis must be who I'm directly descended from.\"\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThe field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\ngives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nbut it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nYou're looking at a great example here.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThese are three extinct species of hominids,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\npotential human ancestors.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nAll dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd they're all dating to roughly the same time.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nFrom left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nthe robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nThat means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nWhich one of these guys am I actually related to?\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nPossibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWell, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nusing the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nagain, largely skull shape.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nThe first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nCarl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nwho in the eighteenth century took it upon himself\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nto categorize every living organism on the planet.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nYou think you've got a tough job?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd he did a pretty good job.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nHe categorized about 12,000 species in \"Systema Naturae.\"\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nHe actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nBut looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\n\"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.\"\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nAnd he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand a blatantly racist category he termed \"Monstrosus,\"\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nwhich basically included all the people he didn't like,\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nincluding imaginary folk like elves.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nbut ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nworking in the pre-Darwinian era.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nExcept, if you had taken physical anthropology\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nas recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nbasically that same classification of humanity.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nHuman races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nCarlton Coon is the best example --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nhad been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfor over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nBut based on what data?\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nVery little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nWell, what I'm going to talk about today,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nwhat I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nInstead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\ndigging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nand saying it on the basis of morphology --\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nwhich we still don't completely understand,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nwe don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nwhat we need to do is turn the problem on its head.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nBecause what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nor a genealogical question.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWhat we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nAnd as any genealogist will tell you --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nanybody have a member of the family, or maybe you\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nhave tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nYou start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nYou and your siblings, you have a parent in common.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nYou and your cousins share a grandparent in common.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nYou gradually trace further and further back into the past,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nadding these ever more distant relationships.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nBut eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nA point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nand you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthat we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nWho were these people who came before?\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe have no written record. Well, actually, we do.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWritten in our DNA, in our genetic code --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwe have a historical document that takes us back in time\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nto the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nNow, a quick primer on DNA.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nI suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nIt is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nof how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nIt's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHow long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nA haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\na haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd the whole thing, if you add it all together,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nis over six billion nucleotides long.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nIf you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthousands of times. It's a lot of information.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nImagine the longest book you can think of, \"War and Peace.\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nNow multiply it by 100.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nAnd imagine copying that by hand.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd you're working away until late at night,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand you're paying attention, but, occasionally,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nwhen you're copying this by hand,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nyou're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nsubstitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSame thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIt doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nBut when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nthrough the generations, they become markers of descent.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nIf you share a marker with someone,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nit means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nthe person who first had that change in their DNA.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nAnd it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nthe pattern of these markers in people all over the world,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nand assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nthat we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nThese are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nMitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nYou get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nall the way back to the very first woman.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nThe Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\ntraces a purely paternal line of descent.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nEverybody in this room, everybody in the world,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nfalls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nNow, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nthey're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nTurn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwith the root at the bottom and the branches going up.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nWhat's the take-home message?\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nWell, the thing that jumps out at you first\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis that the deepest lineages in our family trees\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nare found within Africa, among Africans.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nThat means that Africans have been accumulating\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nthis mutational diversity for longer.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nEvery piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nleft the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nNow, how recently do we share this ancestry?\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWas it millions of years ago, which we might suspect\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nby looking at all this incredible variation around the world?\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nNo, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nWithin the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nMitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nan African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nBut what's even more amazing\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nis that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthe male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nonly lived around 60,000 years ago.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nThat's only about 2,000 human generations,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nthe blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nThat tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThis was an African man who gave rise\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nto all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nIt's only within the last 60,000 years\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nthat we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSuch an amazing story.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nWe're all effectively part of an extended African family.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nWhy didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nor sub-species rather, human races around the world?\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nWhy was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nWell, that's a big question. These \"why\" questions,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nparticularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nthe ones that are tough to answer.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd so when all else fails, talk about the weather.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nWhat was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nWell, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.958\nThe last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nIt went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nLots of evidence from sediment cores\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nand the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nWe hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nbut basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:47.958\ngetting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nNew York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nMost of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nNow, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nabout 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand there aren't a lot of glaciers here,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nexcept on the high mountains here in East Africa.\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nSo what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nRather, Africa was drying out at that time.\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThis is a paleo-climatological map\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nof what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nreconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThe reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIf you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nSo the whole world was drying out.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nThe sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThe Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAnd the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\ncompared to what we have today.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nThe evidence from genetic data\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nis that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\ncrashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nWe nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd then something happened. A great illustration of it.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nLook at some stone tools.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThe ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThe ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nnot our direct ancestors, living in Europe,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nNow, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nor physical anthropologists in the audience,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nbasically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nThe ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nWe are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nuntil around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nThe tool styles don't change that much.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nThe evidence is that the human way of life\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\ndidn't change that much during that period.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nBut then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nall hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nThe stone tools become much more finely crafted.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThe evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nat particular times of the year.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nThe population size started to expand.\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nProbably, according to what many linguists believe,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nfully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthat we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nWe became much more social. The social networks expanded.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThis change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nand they allowed us to start to expand around the world.\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWe've been talking at this conference about African success stories.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nWell, you want the ultimate African success story?\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nLook in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nis because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nprobably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.958\naround 60, 70 thousand years ago --\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nallowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nAn early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nleaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nreaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nA slightly later migration up into the Middle East.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nThese would have been savannah hunters.\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nSo those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nyou'll get to see what a real savannah is like.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nAnd it's basically a meat locker.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nPeople who would have specialized in killing the animals,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nhunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nfollowing the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nduring one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nMigrating eastward, following the grasslands,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nbecause that's what they were adapted to live on.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nAnd when they reached Central Asia,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthey reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.958\na grassland super-highway.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nThe grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:33.958\nstretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nand the entire continent was open to them.\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nEntering Europe around 35,000 years ago,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nand finally, a small group migrating up\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nthrough the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:45.958\ninside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\ntemperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nmigrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAn amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nThe changes that allowed us to do that,\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nthe evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nallowing us to create novel cultures,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:07.958\nallowing us to develop the diversity\n\n00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nthat we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNow, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nof how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nAnd that's the story that I told a couple of years ago\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nin my book, \"The Journey of Man,\" and a film that we made with the same title.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nAnd as we were finishing up that film --\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nit was co-produced with National Geographic --\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI started talking to the folks at NG about this work.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nAnd they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n\"You know, we really see this as kind of\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:44.958\nthe next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,\n\n00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nusing the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nYou know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nand we want to take it to the next level.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nWhat do you want to do next?\"\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:57.958\nWhich is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.\n\n00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nIt is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nyou know, a handful of populations around the world.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nStudied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nWe've just connected the dots. What we need to do\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nis increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nhundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world.\"\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nAnd that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nThe project launched in April 2005.\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nIt has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nThe field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nPeople who have lived in the same location for a long period of time\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nretain a connection to the place where they live\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nthat many of the rest of us have lost.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nSo my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nI live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nWhere am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nBut there are people who retain that link to their ancestors\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nthat allows us to contextualize the DNA results.\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nThat's the focus of the field research,\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nthe centers that we've set up all over the world --\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\n10 of them, top population geneticists.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nBut, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nHow often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:15.958\nThe Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.\n\n00:19:15.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nIn this case, you actually can.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nYou can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nYou can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.958\nAnd you can actually submit those results to the database,\n\n00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nand tell us a little about your genealogical background,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nhave the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nNow, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nafter we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:42.958\ngets plowed back into the project.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nThe majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nIt's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nthat gives money back to indigenous groups around the world\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nfor educational, cultural projects initiated by them.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nThey apply to this fund in order to do various projects,\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nand I'll show you a couple of examples.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:01.958\nSo how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples\n\n00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:03.958\ncollected from indigenous people around the world.\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nThe most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:09.958\n210,000 people have ordered these participation kits\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nsince we launched two years ago,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nwhich has raised around five million dollars,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nthe majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nWe've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nProjects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.958\npreserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,\n\n00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nlanguage revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:33.958\nSo the project is going very, very well,\n\n00:20:33.958 --> 00:20:37.958\nand I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.\n\n00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How photography connects us", "duration": "893", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_griffin_on_how_photography_connects", "transcript": "Let's just start by looking at some great photographs. This is an icon of National Geographic, an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry. But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic, and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph. Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale. He mounted a camera on the tail. A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell. Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson. I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer. A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen. Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth \u2014 they're not very good swimmers \u2014 and we know what's happening to the ice. These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa, photographed by Chris Johns. Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels. This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard, a great portraitist. And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection, photographed by Nick Nichols. This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey. And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor. But, hey, at least it's hygienic. (Laughter) These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance, by David Doubilet. And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason. And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars, photographed by Emory Kristof. Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world, because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment.Here's an example. Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son, and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches. But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty. I can stand here right now and see, as I go tearing into the water after him, the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement. I can see the rocks are over here. There's a wave about to crash onto him. I can see his hands reaching out, and I can see his face in terror, looking at me, saying, \"Help me, Dad.\" I got him. The wave broke over us. We got back on shore; he was fine. We were a little bit rattled. But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it. And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.Now I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week about this, that I was going to tell this story. And he said, \"Oh, yeah, I remember that too! I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me.\" (Laughter) I thought I was a hero. (Laughter)So, this represents \u2014 this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft \u2014 except one. This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year, and it was submitted and published in National Geographic. Last year, we added a section to our website called \"Your Shot,\" where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication. And it has become a wild success, tapping into the enthusiast photography community. The quality of these amateur photographs can, at times, be amazing. And seeing this reinforces, for me, that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them.But to be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you. You've got to be able to make them all the time. But even more importantly, you need to know how to create a visual narrative. You need to know how to tell a story. So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad, called Zakouma. The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species, of an exotic locale. And that is what Nick did, up to a point. This is a serval cat. He's actually taking his own picture, shot with what's called a camera trap. There's an infrared beam that's going across, and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph. These are baboons at a watering hole. Nick \u2014 the camera, again, an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this. And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons. (Laughter) A lion having a late night snack \u2014 notice he's got a broken tooth. And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den. I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail.But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants. It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa. Here's a photograph shot in moonlight, something that digital photography has made a big difference for. It was with the elephants that this story pivoted. Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay, collared the matriarch of the herd. They named her Annie, and they began tracking her movements. The herd was safe within the confines of the park, because of this dedicated group of park rangers. But once the annual rains began, the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.And that's when they ran into trouble. For outside the safety of the park were poachers, who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks. The matriarch that they were radio tracking, after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park, came to a halt outside the park. Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd. And they only came for the ivory. This is actually one of the rangers. They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory, because they couldn't leave it there, because it's still valuable. But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old-school method of just straight, \"Isn't this an amazing world?\" And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply. Instead of just knowledge of this park, he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.Now let's go over to India. Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way. We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project. For the first time in history, more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments. And most of that growth is not in the cities, but in the slums that surround them. Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer, came to me and said, \"We need to document this, and here's my proposal. Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.\" And I said, \"Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.\" So instead, what we did was we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we'd consider sort of a survey story \u2014 where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything \u2014 we put Jonas into Dharavi, which is part of Mumbai, India, and let him stay there, and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city. What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places. He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned. By staying tightly focused in one place, Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community. And he did it in a beautiful way.Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture. We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries. We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject, but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing. Here, in a photo by Brian, a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja. I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch, the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species. But here, Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard. And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never-before-made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.Back on land, Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa, where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals, the main parts having already been sent to Europe. And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market. As prime food sources are depleted, the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein. This is called fishing down the food chain.But there are also glimmers of hope, and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this, we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems. We also want to look for solutions. Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned \u2014 the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial. James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED, took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq. It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home, on the other. Jim started in the battlefield. Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital. Here is in the field hospital. The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home. From here, the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time. And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals, such as here in Walter Reed. And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis, they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives. Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.Now, these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics. But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun. Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals. They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed. So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water. Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins. You know of \"The March of the Penguins.\" This is sort of the munch of the penguins. (Laughter) Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear. And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.But then Paul got in the water. And he said he was never really afraid of this. Well, this one female came up to him. She's probably \u2014 it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph, but she's 12 feet long. So, she is pretty significant in size. And Paul said he was never really afraid, because she was more curious about him than threatened. This mouthing behavior, on the right, was really her way of saying to him, \"Hey, look how big I am!\" Or you know, \"My, what big teeth you have.\" (Laughter) Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him. To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins. So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him, alive, and put them in front of him. She dropped them off, and then they would swim away. She'd kind of look at him, like \"What are you doing?\" Go back and get them, and then bring them back and drop them in front of him. And she did this over the course of a couple of days, until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head. (Laughter) Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph. (Laughter) Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive. This is her just puffing out, you know, snorting out in disgust. (Laughter) And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature, and came back with not just a collection of photographs, but an amazing experience and a great story. It is these kinds of stories, ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism. I believe that photography can make a real connection to people, and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today. Thank you.

The wave broke over us.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWe got back on shore; he was fine.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nWe were a little bit rattled.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nBut this flashbulb memory, as it's called,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nis when all the elements came together to define\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nnot just the event, but my emotional connection to it.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd this is what a photograph taps into\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nwhen it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nNow I have to tell you,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI was talking to Kyle last week about this,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nthat I was going to tell this story.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd he said, \"Oh, yeah, I remember that too!\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nI remember my image of you\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nwas that you were up on the shore yelling at me.\"\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nI thought I was a hero.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nSo,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthis represents -- this is a cross-sample of\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nsome remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nworking at the very top of their craft --\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nexcept one.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThis photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nin New Zealand last year,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nand it was submitted and published in National Geographic.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nLast year, we added a section to our website called \"Your Shot,\"\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwhere anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd it has become a wild success,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\ntapping into the enthusiast photography community.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nThe quality of these amateur photographs\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\ncan, at times, be amazing.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd seeing this reinforces, for me,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nthat every one of us has at least one or two\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\ngreat photographs in them.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nBut to be a great photojournalist,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nyou have to have more than just one or two\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\ngreat photographs in you.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nYou've got to be able to make them all the time.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nBut even more importantly,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nyou need to know how to create a visual narrative.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nYou need to know how to tell a story.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo I'm going to share with you some coverages\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthat I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nPhotographer Nick Nichols went to document\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\na very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nin Chad, called Zakouma.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nThe original intent was to travel there\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand bring back a classic story of diverse species,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nof an exotic locale.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAnd that is what Nick did, up to a point.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nThis is a serval cat.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nHe's actually taking his own picture,\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nshot with what's called a camera trap.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThere's an infrared beam that's going across,\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nThese are baboons at a watering hole.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nNick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\ntook thousands of pictures of this.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nAnd Nick ended up with a lot of pictures\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nof the rear ends of baboons.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nA lion having a late night snack --\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nnotice he's got a broken tooth.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nI love this little bit of water\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthat comes off the back of his tail.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nBut the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nIt's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nHere's a photograph shot in moonlight,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nsomething that digital photography has made a big difference for.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nIt was with the elephants that this story pivoted.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nNick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.958\ncollared the matriarch of the herd.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nThey named her Annie,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nand they began tracking her movements.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nThe herd was safe within the confines of the park,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nbecause of this dedicated group of park rangers.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nBut once the annual rains began,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nthe herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd that's when they ran into trouble.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nFor outside the safety of the park were poachers,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nwho would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nThe matriarch that they were radio tracking,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nafter weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\ncame to a halt outside the park.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnnie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they only came for the ivory.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThis is actually one of the rangers.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nThey were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nbecause they couldn't leave it there,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbecause it's still valuable.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nBut what Nick did was he brought back\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\na story that went beyond the old-school method\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nof just straight, \"Isn't this an amazing world?\"\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nInstead of just knowledge of this park,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nhe created an understanding and an empathy\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nfor the elephants, the rangers and the many issues\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nsurrounding human-wildlife conflicts.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nNow let's go over to India.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nWe were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\ntouches upon in his new world population project.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nFor the first time in history,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nmore people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd most of that growth is not in the cities,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nbut in the slums that surround them.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nJonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\ncame to me and said,\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\n\"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nLet's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.\"\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.\"\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo instead, what we did was\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwe decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nin what we'd consider sort of a survey story --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwhere you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwe put Jonas into Dharavi,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwhich is part of Mumbai, India,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nand let him stay there, and really get into\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe heart and soul of this really major part of the city.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWhat Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nat the awful conditions that exist in such places.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nHe saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nof how the entire urban area functioned.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nBy staying tightly focused in one place,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nJonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nthat underlies this community.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd he did it in a beautiful way.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nWe teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nand photojournalist Randy Olson\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nto document the depletion of the world's fisheries.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nWe weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nbut the photographs that Brian and Randy created\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nare among the best to capture both the human\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand natural devastation of overfishing.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nHere, in a photo by Brian,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\na seemingly crucified shark is caught up\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nin a gill net off of Baja.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nI've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthe animals accidentally scooped up\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nwhile fishing for a specific species.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nBut here, Brian captured a unique view\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nby positioning himself underneath the boat\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nwhen they threw the waste overboard.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nAnd Brian then went on to even greater risk\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nto get this never-before-made photograph\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nof a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nBack on land, Randy Olson photographed\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\na makeshift fish market in Africa,\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nwhere the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthe main parts having already been sent to Europe.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nAnd here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nAs prime food sources are depleted,\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthe harvest goes deeper into the oceans\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nand brings in more such sources of protein.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nThis is called fishing down the food chain.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nBut there are also glimmers of hope,\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nand I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nwe don't really want to go\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nand just look at all the problems.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nWe also want to look for solutions.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nBrian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwhere commercial fishing had been banned --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nthe result being that the overfished species have been restored,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nPhotography can also compel us to confront\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nissues that are potentially distressing and controversial.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nJames Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\ntook a look at the sweep of the medical system\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nthat is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nIt is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nand exits back home, on the other.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nJim started in the battlefield.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nHere, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\non the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nHere is in the field hospital.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nThe soldier on the right has the name of his daughter\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\ntattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nFrom here, the more severely wounded are transported\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nback to Germany, where they meet up with their families\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nfor the first time.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nAnd then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nsuch as here in Walter Reed.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nthey exit the medical system and attempt\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nto regain their pre-war lives.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nJim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nand gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nNow, these stories are great examples\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nof how photography can be used\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nto address some of our most important topics.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nBut there are also times when photographers\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nsimply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\njust plain fun.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nPhotographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nto shoot a story on leopard seals.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThey have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\none of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nIn fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\ngrabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSo you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nabout getting into the water.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nNow, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nYou know of \"The March of the Penguins.\"\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThis is sort of the munch of the penguins.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nHere a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nto see if the coast is clear.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nAnd then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nBut then Paul got in the water.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nAnd he said he was never really afraid of this.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nWell, this one female came up to him.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nShe's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nbut she's 12 feet long.\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, she is pretty significant in size.\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nAnd Paul said he was never really afraid,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nbecause she was more curious about him than threatened.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThis mouthing behavior, on the right,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nwas really her way of saying to him, \"Hey, look how big I am!\"\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nOr you know, \"My, what big teeth you have.\"\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThen Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nTo her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nthat for some reason didn't seem to be interested\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nin chasing penguins.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nSo what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nalive, and put them in front of him.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nShe dropped them off, and then they would swim away.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nShe'd kind of look at him, like \"What are you doing?\"\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nGo back and get them, and then bring them back\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nand drop them in front of him.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd she did this over the course of a couple of days,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nuntil the point where she got so frustrated with him\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nthat she started putting them directly on top of his head.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWhich just resulted in a fantastic photograph.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nEventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nthat he was never going to survive.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nThis is her just puffing out, you know,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nsnorting out in disgust.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nPaul set out to photograph a relatively\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nmysterious and unknown creature,\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nand came back with not just a collection of photographs,\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nbut an amazing experience and a great story.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nIt is these kinds of stories,\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nthat demonstrate the power of photojournalism.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nI believe that photography can make a real connection to people,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nand can be employed as a positive agent\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nfor understanding the challenges and opportunities\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nfacing our world today.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThank you.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Close-up card magic with a twist", "duration": "1868", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/lennart_green_does_close_up_card_magic", "transcript": "My favorite topic is shortcuts. The master of shortcuts \u2014 it's, of course, nature. But I will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point, to find an answer probably much quicker than Arthur did. So, first, we violate the common sense, the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this, 90 degrees \u2014 all of you. Not you. All of you, right? Palm up. If you do this, the common, the logic says you must turn the wrist. Do you agree? Good. But I will first teach you a method, how you can do it without moving the wrist, and then the shortcut. You can do it immediately, right? Hold the hand like this, palm up. Don't move the wrist. The wrist is \u2014 I doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are. Right-molded you say, with iron? That was a joke, actually, and I \u2014 OK. Hold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist. Forward, don't move the wrist. Up, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist. And forward. Yeah. Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 logic, logically, you have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist. (Laughter) Now, the shortcut. (Laughter) But it was six moves. Now with one move. I start here, palm down, you can follow. And then look at me. Yeah! (Laughter) One move. OK. So, that was the warming up.Now, I need an assistant. I talked to a nice girl before, Zoe. She has left. No! A big hand. (Applause)Good. Nice. And you can sit over there. One item here was water, right? And I will give my tribute to water. I think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about \u2014 cheers. (Laughter) Beer has about \u2014 there's a lot of water in beer. (Laughter)So, now I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing, control cards and so on. And I think I'll take off this one. I work with a special method to do it, quick. I work with precision \u2014 oh, sorry \u2014 control and a very powerful ... memory system, right? (Laughter) So, if \u2014 I have studied the poker. I like to gamble. Officially, I don't gamble but ... So, if we are \u2014 if we have five person, and I will do a five-handed poker game.Now I will interact. So a different person all the time, so not the same person can answer. So we have an agreement. Which one shall have a good poker hand? Which number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)Lennart Green: Three \u2014 good. And here, I had a mat here to make it a little \u2014 the critical moment is \u2014 sorry. If a card shark gathers the cards together, immediately when he \u2014 before he deals the card. Now, so I think, number three, I have arranged them in a full house. (Laughter) With queens and \u2014 it's OK \u2014 queens and tens. That's a challenge. I like this. I will explain later. One, two, three, four, five. I start with three queens. So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards. And two tens. Yeah. Thank you. (Applause) But also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too. So these guys have actually a stronger hand \u2014 three aces and two kings. This guy beats them with four of a kind, or deuce \u2014 deuce. No reaction? That with even \u2014 OK, and this. These look in order, I'm probably \u2014 hopefully \u2014 yeah. Three, four, five, six, seven and ... But, of course, I will have the winning hand. Ten, jack, queen, king, ace. Yeah. So, good. (Laughter) So the hand that looks so good from the beginning, number three, at the end was actually the lowest hand. Such life. Right?So, please mix them. Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some underground techniques. Yes? I work with kind of estimation, shuffle tracking \u2014 ah, good. Impressive. Thank you. (Laughter)So, first, the first term is estimation. Here, I can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush. Of course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker. Right? You agree. So here I have, actually \u2014 I know exactly where the cards are. So here, I can make a bet, and this is actually one of the points where I get my money. So here: 10, jack, queen, king, ace. OK. (Applause)Next is a term \u2014 I do it quick. I call this stealing. So here, I think I know about where the cards are. I will spread the cards and you'll say stop, when I point to them, right. Point, say stop.Zoe: Stop.LG: Here \u2014 you see some are missing? And that's the stealing cards, which I did. (Laughter)OK. Now, another term called shuffle tracking. Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards, even if another person shuffles. This is a little risky. So \u2014 because if you look, now, I can still see it. You agree? But if you square \u2014 square, and shuffle, and then a cut. So here, to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin \u2014 ah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK. Come to \u2014 no, no, no, no. I'm joking, yeah? Any style \u2014 yeah, good. Here I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate. I work direct with the right brain. If you pass the left brain, you have to take care of logic and common sense. Direct in the right brain, that's much better. And so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing. And if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor, you have \u2014 that's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge, where you can find any solution of any problem.OK. Now, I drop the cards, and you say stop anyway, right? Not at the last card.Zoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.When I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check. (Laughter) Ah, not in order, it \u2014 that was a mistake. No, I'm kidding. (Applause) No, now and then I put in a mistake, just to emphasize how difficult it is. Right? Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake. But now I'm glad I remember it. So, this deck is bought here. Sorry. I have a little pad to make it a little softer. This deck is bought here in America. It's called \"Bicycle.\" And this deck is very flexible, but not so many people know, if you check, if you press at the right spots, you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right? Now, you can carry this in your wallet, so ... You don't see it, make no reaction? (Laughter) So, but here, and \u2014 is the camera getting too much? No. (Laughter)Yeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)LG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this. But not too much. Then you have to push it down again. Here, please. If you push these heaps \u2014 everyone see \u2014 push them together so they are really interlaced, right? Yeah, good. Perfect. Just push them through, good. Thank you. And then, I will demonstrate a thing from Russian satellite, stealen \u2014 stolen, probably copied from America but we will see.Here \u2014 shortcuts. I talk about shortcuts. Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern. The new chaos theory is already old, right? But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals \u2014 the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things. And it's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way, and not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate, then you go to \u2014 then it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk in another language ... Yeah, great. I think I have it.So now, different persons, older, tap. Please name any card, anyone.(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.Jack of spades. I think jack of spades is number 12 from the top. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Yes, right. So \u2014 oh, jack of spades.You said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah. My fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs. So, jack of spades. I think ... 23 \u2014 24, sorry, 24. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 \u2014 ah, 25, yes. It's the last. Now, I do it quicker, better. OK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 actually, my technique is to peek, all the time. When I lift the heap, I peek. You see, yeah, perfect. Three, four, five, six. Then I calculate \u2014 yeah, good. (Laughter)Another person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)LG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven. So I will do it quick, very quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow. (Laughter)Seven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)LG: Diamonds, good. I start here. Good, thank you. (Applause) The thing I did \u2014 I peeked. I know where the card were, then I chose it. So another person, another card. (Laughter) Another person.(Audience: Ten of diamonds.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Ten of diamonds.)LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah. I think I do it the same way. I like to, so I know where it is. Ten of diamonds. But now I do it the regular speed, right? Ten of diamonds. Good. Maybe you will cut? Lift. Excellent. So, thank you. Another person, another card.(Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)LG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot. We can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards. And you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it? Five of clubs. Not the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here. (Laughter) We do it again. The person who said five of clubs say stop, when the cards are in the air, right?(Audience: Stop.)LG: Very good. OK. (Applause)OK, I had to use a little force there. I think we save five of clubs. And now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah. Excellent. I love that card. Here, I will do the most difficult thing. For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas, and you're betting, and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card. And now, when I lift this card, it shall be your card. What was your card?(Audience: Queen of hearts.)LG: Queen of? Queen of hearts. So that's a tough challenge, right? So here, I grab \u2014 you know this? Five of clubs ... and queen of hearts. Yes! This is a tough one, because here I must take advantage of \u2014 I switch it with the five of clubs. So, now a false count. Which card shall I use? Queen or five?Zoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.So, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs. The false count \u2014 and the number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight \u2014 you say the same card all the time. Eight, nine, 10. This is a kind of optical deal, right? When I put one card at a table \u2014 look, it's not one card. It's \u2014 look, it's a bunch of cards that gives this impression. Yeah. Now some hard stuff. I think we keep the queen here, yes. Now, to the satellites things. This \u2014 oh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault. (Laughter)This is high-frequency laser, and it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely. Right, sorry, my \u2014 I should have mentioned that, yeah. But you can relax, because it takes half an hour before it works, so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance. (Laughter) Now, I put the laser here, and \u2014 now, when I deal the cards in the laser, I know where they are but \u2014 yes? Did the camera got it? No? They didn't? What happened?(Audience: It disappeared.)LG: OK, I'll take another group. Do the cameras see the cards now?No? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)LG: But you see the hand. Ah, good, good, good. But now. So now, that was the reason, right? You see the cards? Yes. (Laughter) Yeah, good. Now \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen, do it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen. (Laughter) Yeah, interesting, but a little dangerous. (Laughter) I liked it. Now, a little more difficult. Name \u2014 anyone, name, please, any suit.(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.So here, here I have to peek, lots of cards. I think there are lots of \u2014 I don't know how many \u2014 but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right? (Laughter) So every time I lift the heap, I peek, right. Then I arrange them so I can get them quick. Perfect, excellent. So I start with the ace \u2014 yeah, ace. Ah, yeah \u2014 spades? Same mistake as before, right? So \u2014 I arrange the spades \u2014 the clubs. I try to do this right here. First, I take the spades. You see, I don't work with prestige, so always do mistakes. It doesn't matter to me. And now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right? One, two, three, four \u2014 yes, the camera got it? Five, six, seven, eight \u2014 ah \u2014 nine, 10, the jack, jack of spades, queen of \u2014 I like that laugh, yeah! Good. Queen. (Laughter) Wait, wait, wait \u2014 please take any card. Grab any one. Quick, quick, good. And we switch this to the king. Ace of diamonds. And now, look, ace of diamonds will guide. So I find ... king of spades. There was the place. And here is king of spades, correct? Yeah? OK. (Applause)Now, a little more difficult thing. Maybe you think I have the cards in order already, so you help me to shuffle again. Another suit, please.(Audience: Armani.) LG: Pardon? (Audience: Armani.) (Laughter)LG: It was after the blindfold. I like this guy, yeah. OK. That should be my end effect, but OK. Armani \u2014 who said Armani? You? I drop the cards and you \u2014 which size? Which size? It's a piece of cake. I like challenges. Which size?(Audience: Extra large.) LG: Extra large, OK.Say stop. (Audience: Stop.) (Laughter)LG: Yeah, Armani. OK. (Applause) Ah, this is tough. OK, a suit. I had clubs before, spades.Another suit. (Audience: Diamonds.) LG: Diamonds, perfect.So, in this case, I try to locate diamonds. I look at the cards, and OK. We try. Yeah. You help me. If I drop the card face up, like this, you reverse it. Zoe: OK. LG: OK, now. Do with both hands, and quick. Yes, good, good. (Laughter) I think we have it now. Yeah, good, good. So here, diamonds, hearts \u2014 no, diamonds. Good, good. Stop. Do you see the pattern? No? Now? Yes, yes, OK. I work with pattern. Oh sorry, I dropped one. Maybe it's important \u2014 yeah \u2014 nine of diamonds, OK. So now \u2014 I always ask, why do I put myself in this position? I have to figure out so many outs, when I miss some cards, but I love it. So now, I will do it. I will try to find the diamonds, but I will do it the hard way. It's too easy to do it right away, right? I think I will do it ... blindfolded. At this distance, it works immediately. Aargh! (Laughter)Duct tape. I look \u2014 shake the cards, so I don't. Go ahead. Yeah, good. I like the empathy. Empathy. But it was \u2014 did you hear? It was women's voice. Hear the guy \u2014 yeah, more, more, more. (Laughter) Yeah, good. Yeah. You can take the nostril too, because some guys think \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 some guys think I can peek through the nostril, so do more. Go, go. Right? Good. Satisfied? Looks good, like Batman. Ow! (Laughter) No, with dignity and elegance, right? But I like her, yeah. I said, be a little tough. And it was OK. One more? The last. OK. All right.Now you must agree that I'm \u2014 I must rely on other senses, right? I work with vibration. So, what was the card? Diamonds. Ah, I memorized hearts. So now I have to improvise again. Maybe I'll stand up. Half. Diamonds \u2014 I'll start with ace of diamonds. Just kidding, warming up \u2014 king of hearts. (Laughter) And I give you a diamonds, so they \u2014 so you put them here, in a nice row, right. And you can see, yeah? Good. Ace of diamonds, yes? Zoe: Yeah.LG: Good. Good. Two \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thank you. I never ever miss two. This is interesting. Always I've found two, but the wrong color. Spades, sorry. And the deck is a gift to you after, so let the skepticals here, in this, examine them, right? Remind me. It's a gift. Two \u2014 and it was two of spades, right? Sorry, two of diamonds. I'll do it quick now. Three \u2014 three of diamonds. Yes! Four \u2014 I like challenges, yes. Yeah, good.Chris Anderson: You're peeking.LG: Pardon?CA: You're peeking. You just got to \u2014 this is a request from the lady in the back. (Laughter)Okay. Try that. LG: Yeah. Also listen. OK, now. This is maybe a little tough. We will try. Yes? Good? (Laughter) OK. So, how many cards? Five? Zoe: Four.LG: Four. Is five the next card?Zoe: Five of diamonds, yeah.LG: It's not here? Zoe: It's not there.LG: Oh. So here, all the cards are face down \u2014 you agree? (Audience: Yes.)LG: Yes? You see that in the screen? And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here. So next card will be \u2014 was it five?Zoe: Five. LG: Yeah \u2014 I will reverse it face up here.Yes? Zoe: Yeah. LG: Six \u2014 six with the thumb. Seven. Yeah, I do this. I know where it is, because I peeked before and then I do this. Right? Eight. If \u2014 and then nine, right? Yeah. Yesterday \u2014 the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas, and I used this actually. Nine? Yeah? Correct? No? Yes! Ah, good, good. Ten \u2014 once again, I love this Jonny Wayne move. Yeah. Jack \u2014 you [unclear] with Jack? Jack of diamonds, correct? (Audience: No.)LG: Yes? And queen! Queen, with misdirection. Misdirection. (Applause) Yeah? And then, king, after exactly five seconds. Yeah. Five. Five seconds. One, two, three, four \u2014 mmm! Check it. Yes?CA: King of diamonds. LG: Ah! Good. Oh.

So a different person\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nall the time, so not the same person can answer.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nSo we have an agreement.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nWhich one shall have a good poker hand?\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nWhich number?

(Audience: Three.)\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nLennart Green: Three -- good.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nhere,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nI had a mat here to make it a little --\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nthe critical moment is -- sorry.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nIf a card shark gathers the cards together,\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nimmediately when he --\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nbefore he deals the card. Now,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nso I think, number three,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nI have arranged them in a full house.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:57.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nWith queens and -- it's OK --\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nqueens and tens.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nThat's a challenge. I like this.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nI will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nI start with three queens.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nAnd two tens.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nYeah.

That with even --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nOK, and this.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThese look in order, I'm probably -- hopefully --\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nyeah. Three, four, five, six, seven\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nand ...\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nBut, of course, I will have the winning hand.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nTen, jack,\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nqueen, king, ace.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nYeah. So,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\ngood.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nSo the hand that looks so good from the beginning,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nnumber three, at the end\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwas actually the lowest hand.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nSuch life. Right?\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nSo, please mix them.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nNow, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nunderground techniques.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nYes?\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nI work with\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nkind of estimation,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nshuffle tracking --\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nah, good.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nImpressive.

You agree.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nSo here I have, actually --\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nI know exactly where the cards are.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nSo here, I can make a bet,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nand this is actually one of the points where I get my money.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo here: 10, jack,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nqueen, king, ace.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nOK.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nNext\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nis a term --\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI do it quick. I call this stealing.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo here, I think\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nI know about where the cards are.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nI will spread the cards and you'll say stop,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nwhen I point to them, right. Point, say stop.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nZoe: Stop.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nLG: Here -- you see some are missing?\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd that's the stealing cards, which I did.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nOK.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, another term called shuffle tracking.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nShuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\neven if another person shuffles.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nThis is a little risky.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nSo -- because if you look, now, I can still see it.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nYou agree? But if you square --\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nsquare, and shuffle,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nand then a cut.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo here,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nto follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin --\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nCome to -- no, no, no, no.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nI'm joking, yeah?\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nAny style -- yeah, good.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nHere I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nI work direct with the right brain.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nIf you pass the left brain,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nyou have to take care of logic and common sense.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nDirect in the right brain, that's much better. And so --\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nArthur Benjamin did\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\na little of the same thing.\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nAnd if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nyou have -- that's the password\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nto the\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:19.958\ncosmic bank of knowledge,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nwhere you can find any solution of any problem.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nOK. Now, I drop the cards,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nand you say stop anyway, right?\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nNot at the last card.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nZoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nWhen I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAh, not in order, it -- that was a mistake.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nNo, now and then I put in a mistake,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\njust to emphasize how difficult it is.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nRight?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nBut now I'm glad I remember it.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nSo,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthis deck is bought here.

Ow!\n\n00:25:07.958 --> 00:25:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:25:10.958 --> 00:25:13.958\nNo, with dignity and elegance, right?\n\n00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:18.958\nBut I like her, yeah.

LG: Okay, thank you."}, {"title": "Dog-friendly dog training", "duration": "886", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ian_dunbar_on_dog_friendly_dog_training", "transcript": "Dogs have interests. They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels. And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction. It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it, and the owner says, you know, \"Puppy, come here, come here,\" and the dog thinks, \"Hmm, interesting. I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling.\" It's a difficult choice, right? Rear end, owner. Rear end wins. I mean, you lose. You cannot compete with the environment, if you have an adolescent dog's brain. So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view.Now, I'm here largely because there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that \u2014 on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog, number one, by making up rules, human rules. We don't take the dog's point of view into account. So the human says, \"You're going to act this way, damn it. We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.\" Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog. And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed. So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew. When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg \u2014 you know, isn't that nice? And you go, \"Oh, there's a good boy.\" You bend down, you pat him \u2014 you reward him for jumping up. His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later, he weighs, you know, 80 pounds. Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse. I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.So, this whole dominance issue \u2014 number one, what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system. And they take this stuff seriously. Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy, because it prevents physical fights. Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand, have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule. The number one is, \"I have it, you don't.\" And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male. So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances, or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.Dogs get so abused. Dogs, horses and humans \u2014 these are the three species which are so abused in life. And the reason is built into their behavior \u2014 is to always come back and apologize. Like, \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.\" They are just so beatable, and that's why they get beaten. The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say? \"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws, stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice, hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper, knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.\" Because he grew? And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do? This is insanity. I ask owners, \"Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?\" And people say, \"Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.\" I said, \"Let's teach him to sit.\" And then we give him a reason for sitting. Because the first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL. I could speak to you and say, \"Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.\" Go on, something should happen now. Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili. Well, I've got news for you. The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL, English as a second language. And that's how we use the food lure in the hand, and we use food because we're dealing with owners. My wife doesn't need food \u2014 she's a great trainer, much better than I am. I don't need food, but the average owner says, \"Puppy, sit.\" Or they go, \"Sit, sit, sit.\" They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason, like the dog has a third eye there \u2014 it's insane. You know, \"Sit, sit.\" No, we go, \"Puppy, sit\" \u2014 boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.Then we phase out the food as a lure, and now the dog knows that \"sit\" means sit, and you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence. \"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.\" And I've taught her \"Phoenix,\" \"come here,\" \"take this,\" \"go to\" and the name of my son, \"Jamie.\" And the dog can take a note, and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog. He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, \"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.\"So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do. Will it do it? Not necessarily, no. As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff, why come to the owner? The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time. The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to. At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do what we want him to do, and this is very easy. We use the Premack principle. Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior \u2014 one the dog doesn't want to do \u2014 by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem, or a dog hobby \u2014 something the dog does like to do. That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior. So we go, \"sit,\" on the couch; \"sit,\" tummy-rub; \"sit,\" look, I throw a tennis ball; \"sit,\" say hello to that other dog. Yes, we put \"sniff butt\" on queue. \"Sit,\" sniff butt.So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training. And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like \u2014 we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us. And I can imagine this dog, you know, speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita, saying, \"Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train. They're like Golden Retrievers. All I have to do is sit, and they do everything. They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me, they will throw tennis balls, they will cook for me and serve the food. It's like, if I just sit, that's my command. Then I have my own personal doorman, chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.\" And now the dog's really happy. And this, to me, is always what training is. So we really motivate the dog to want to do it, such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.Now we move to phase three, when now \u2014 there's times, you know, when daddy knows best. And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, \"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.\" Sorry, no more explanation. \"I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.\" And there's times, for example, if my son's friends leave the door open, the dogs have to know you don't step across this line. This is a life-or-death thing. You leave this, the sanctity of your house, and you could be hit on the street. So some things we have to let the dog know, \"You mustn't do this.\"And so we have to enforce, but without force. People here get very confused about what a punishment is. They think a punishment is something nasty. I bet a lot of you do, right? You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty. It doesn't have to be. There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future. It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful. And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago. And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child. And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house, and they never took it outside. The dog is actually euthanized now, but this was a dog I worked with for a while. A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen, so while I was there \u2014 this was on the fourth visit \u2014 we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat. And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence. When the dog would try to leave the mat, she would say, \"Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.\" The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner, because we had a lot of aggression related towards food. The breaks got fewer and fewer. You see, the punishment was working. The behavior problem was going away. She never raised her voice. If she did, she would have got bitten. It's not a good dog you shout at. And a lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears \u2014 if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it \u2014 killer whales. I love it because it wires you up. How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear? \"Bad bear, bad bear!\" Voom! Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK? This is crazy.So, where do we go from here? We want a better way. Dogs deserve better. But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs. It has to do with watching people train puppies, and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills, horrendous relationship skills. Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class. I mean, my all-time classic is another \"come here\" one. You see someone in the park \u2014 and I'll cover my mic when I say this, because I don't want to wake you up \u2014 and there's the owner in the park, and their dog's over here, and they say, \"Rover, come here. Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch.\" The dog says, \"I don't think so.\" (Laughter) I mean, who in their right mind would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that? Instead, the dog says, \"I know that tone. I know that tone. Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there.\" I was walking onto a plane \u2014 this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career, and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy-training thing, the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them. You know, I puppy-train my child. And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five, kicking the back of the chair. \"Johnny, don't do that.\" Kick, kick, kick. \"Johnny, don't do that.\" Kick, kick, kick. I'm standing right here with my bag. The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face. And ugly face is this \u2014 when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child, you say, \"What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!\" And I went, \"Oh my God, do I do something?\" That child has lost everything \u2014 that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet. And I thought, \"Do I tell this jerk to quit it?\" I thought, \"Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on.\" I walked to the back of the plane, I sat down, and a thought came to me. If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out. (Laughter) If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out. He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.And this is what it's all about. These relationship skills are so easy. I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate based on the three Cs \u2014 coat color, conformation, cuteness. You know, kind of like a little robot. This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year. And then, a little behavior problem comes up. No different from the dog barking. The husband won't clear up his clothes, or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK? And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback \u2014 there's two things about it. When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent. And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty. You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents. You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee. It's as if there's some schadenfreude there, that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong, so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have. It really is. We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad. And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught. You know, calculus is wonderful. When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz. I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid. Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics \u2014 these are cool things. But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.And my look to the future is, and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people that you know, your husband's just as easy to train. Probably easier \u2014 if you got a Rottie \u2014 much easier to train. Your kids are easy to train. All you've got to do is to watch them, to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes, you ask the question, \"Is it good, or is it bad?\" If it's good, say, \"That was really neat, thank you.\" That is such a powerful training technique. This should be taught in schools. Relationships \u2014 how do you negotiate? How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy? You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship? How on earth about raising children? We think how we do it \u2014 one night in bed, we're pregnant, and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child. No, this is what should be taught \u2014 the good living, the good habits, which are just as hard to break as bad habits. So, that would be my wish to the future. Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time, but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two \u2014 so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

Rear end wins.\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nI mean, you lose.\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.958\nYou cannot compete with the environment,\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nif you have an adolescent dog's brain.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nSo, when we train, we're always trying to take into account\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nthe dog's point of view.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nNow, I'm here largely because\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nthere's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nnumber one, by making up rules, human rules.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nWe don't take the dog's point of view into account.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nSo the human says, \"You're going to act this way, damn it.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nWe're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.\"\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThen, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nAnd then number three, now we can punish the dog\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nfor breaking rules he didn't even know existed.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nWhen he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nyou know, isn't that nice?\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAnd you go, \"Oh, there's a good boy.\"\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nYou bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nHis one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nhe weighs, you know, 80 pounds.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nEvery time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nSo, this whole dominance issue -- number one,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nwhat we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nof a very complicated social system.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nAnd they take this stuff seriously.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nMale dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nbecause it prevents physical fights.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nOf course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nhave several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nThe number one is, \"I have it, you don't.\"\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nAnd what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nwill quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nSo, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nor of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nDogs get so abused.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nDogs, horses and humans --\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nthese are the three species which are so abused in life.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd the reason is built into their behavior --\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nis to always come back and apologize.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nLike, \"Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThey are just so beatable,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nand that's why they get beaten.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nThe poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\n\"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nstamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nhit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nknee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.\"\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nBecause he grew?\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nThis is insanity.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nI ask owners, \"Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?\"\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nAnd people say, \"Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.\"\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nI said, \"Let's teach him to sit.\"\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nAnd then we give him a reason for sitting.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nBecause the first stage\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nis basically teaching a dog ESL.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nI could speak to you and say, \"Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.\"\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nGo on, something should happen now.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nWhy aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nWell, I've got news for you.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nThe dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nEnglish as a second language.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nAnd that's how we use the food lure in the hand,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand we use food because we're dealing with owners.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nMy wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nmuch better than I am.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nI don't need food, but the average owner says,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\n\"Puppy, sit.\"\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nOr they go, \"Sit, sit, sit.\"\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nlike the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nYou know, \"Sit, sit.\"\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nNo, we go, \"Puppy, sit\" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThen we phase out the food as a lure,\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nand now the dog knows that \"sit\" means sit,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand you can actually communicate to a dog\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nin a perfectly constructed English sentence.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\n\"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.\"\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nAnd I've taught her \"Phoenix,\" \"come here,\" \"take this,\" \"go to\"\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nand the name of my son, \"Jamie.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd the dog can take a note,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nHe'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nand take him a little message that says,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\n\"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner.\"\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nSo, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWill it do it?\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nNot necessarily, no.\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAs I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nwhy come to the owner?\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThe dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nThe dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nAt the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwith smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nSo the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nwhat we want him to do, and this is very easy.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nWe use the Premack principle.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBasically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\none the dog doesn't want to do --\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nby a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nor a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nThat will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nSo we go, \"sit,\" on the couch; \"sit,\" tummy-rub; \"sit,\"\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nlook, I throw a tennis ball; \"sit,\" say hello to that other dog.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nYes, we put \"sniff butt\" on queue.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\n\"Sit,\" sniff butt.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nSo now all of these distractions that worked against training\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nnow become rewards that work for training.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAnd what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nwe're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nAnd I can imagine this dog, you know,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nspeaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nsaying, \"Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nThey're like Golden Retrievers.\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nAll I have to do is sit, and they do everything.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nThey open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthey will throw tennis balls,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthey will cook for me and serve the food.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nIt's like, if I just sit, that's my command.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nThen I have my own personal doorman,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nchauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.\"\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd now the dog's really happy.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd this, to me, is always what training is.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nSo we really motivate the dog to want to do it,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nsuch that the need for punishment seldom comes up.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nNow we move to phase three, when now --\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nthere's times, you know, when daddy knows best.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n\"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.\"\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nSorry, no more explanation. \"I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.\"\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nAnd there's times, for example,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nif my son's friends leave the door open,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nthe dogs have to know you don't step across this line.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nThis is a life-or-death thing.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nYou leave this, the sanctity of your house,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand you could be hit on the street.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nSo some things we have to let the dog know,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\n\"You mustn't do this.\"\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd so we have to enforce, but without force.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nPeople here get very confused about what a punishment is.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nThey think a punishment is something nasty.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nI bet a lot of you do, right?\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nYou think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nIt doesn't have to be.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nThere's several definitions of what a punishment is,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbut one definition, the most popular, is:\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:56.958\na punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nsuch that it's less likely to occur in the future.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nIt does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nAnd I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nI was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nplus the brother-in-law, plus the child.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nAnd I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand they never took it outside.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nThe dog is actually euthanized now,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nbut this was a dog I worked with for a while.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nA lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nso while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nwe did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWhen the dog would try to leave the mat,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nshe would say, \"Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.\"\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThe dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nbecause we had a lot of aggression related towards food.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nThe breaks got fewer and fewer.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nYou see, the punishment was working.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nThe behavior problem was going away.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nShe never raised her voice.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIf she did, she would have got bitten.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nIt's not a good dog you shout at.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nAnd a lot of my friends train really neat animals,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\ngrizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\non the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nkiller whales. I love it because it wires you up.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nHow are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n\"Bad bear, bad bear!\" Voom!\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nYour head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nThis is crazy.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nWe want a better way.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDogs deserve better.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nBut for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt has to do with watching people train puppies,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nhorrendous relationship skills.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nNot just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI mean, my all-time classic is another \"come here\" one.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nYou see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nbecause I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand their dog's over here, and they say, \"Rover, come here.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nRover, come here.

Not being the musicians \u2014 the listeners, right? And we crave one thing, even though we kind of don't know it all the time. We crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded, the day it was played. And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can. But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded. And it turns out the further back you go in history, the little rougher it sounds. And so we said, there's a solution to this. Let's separate the performance, as a thing, out from the recording, which was how it was made. You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day. But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers, and what instruments they were using. And it's the data hidden inside the recording. In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution. And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro that looks like a nice grand piano there. And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things \u2014 but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan. And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition. And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley, in terms of \u2014 artificial intelligence terms. We have a process where we, you know, kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis. And we look at every single note, and all the attributes of those notes: how hard they were struck, and how they were held down, and how you move the fingers. So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers. And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you, but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.I'm going to start with Glenn Gould. He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year. Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century. He just got tired of being in front of an audience, and felt like \u2014 a performing monkey was, in fact, his term. So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work. And Gould's specialty was playing Bach. His maybe most famous recording was something called \"The Goldberg Variations.\" Bach only wrote themes and variations one time. He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, \"Here's a theme \u2014 30 variations.\" In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line. And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about, one in mono, and one in stereo. And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal, and as he got older, he said, \"No, no, wait a minute. I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal.\" What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version, and we'll play the first couple pieces of it. Glenn Gould, 1955. (Music) How about that? (Applause)So let me tell you a little bit how this was done. First of all, let me get you to the end step. This is \u2014 we have a fairly complex process that, you know, software and musicians and so on, but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter. We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other. So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard. And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording, and the left speaker is going to be the new recording, actually of an instrument just like that one, and I'm going to play them together at the same time. (Music) That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together. (Music)Before \"Jurassic Park,\" there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right? So, in the video world, we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior. And this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior. And then you heard the original. Ultimately, I started with the experience. And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians. Lots of you can afford to buy one of these. But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound. And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround, go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer. It's so involving compared to regular stereo. But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones. And so on the same disk we have five recordings \u2014 Sony has five recordings. And you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording. And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument, and it's got microphones where the ears are. And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this, you're inside of Glenn Gould's body. And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians, who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say, \"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano.\" Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano, and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process. It's a game changer.Here's now something we know in spectacular quality. The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. What you heard today was not perfect. It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt, and steel strings, and all these, and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity. So when you go into the recording session, you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to. There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano. Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years. Audio has come very late to this game \u2014 I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering. I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed. And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool \u2014 they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions, and you can't trick them very easily. Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.All right, there's this episode of \"Star Trek.\" (Laughter) I get it \u2014 it was all just laid in for me yesterday there. The episode of \"Star Trek\" for me was James Daly played Methuselah \u2014 remember this one? And at some point he's dancing with his \u2014 and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967. Right, do you know where I'm going? And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano, and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it. And then Spock turns round, he goes, \"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes, and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.\" That's where I'm at. I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write. I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play. But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data, that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things, again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world. It's now coming in this world. The transition will be this one. It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played. And I believe this is coming. Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data \u2014 no Glenn Gould in the room. But yet, it was human. And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners. Every time you listen to a recording today, every time you take out your iPod and whatever, every time you listen to it, it's the same thing \u2014 it's frozen. Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different? This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song, the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday. You want to hear it played by different musicians. You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.We've seen all these \"Star Treks,\" and they're all holodeck episodes as well. Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps. It's so amazing, it's so exciting. Every time I listen to that recording it's like, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.\" It's a way better experience than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form. And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum. So I've really overshot my budget here. We made a new recording of him playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September. It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949. And I've got to tell you, we have this lab where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina, and we flew out to Los Angeles. And as the president of the company, I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were. That's a real uncomfortable feeling, when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team, and people are going to be sitting there in the audience. And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine, which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people. And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ... and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day. And we captured all that data all over again. And I want you to hear that right now. And fortunately, it's right in here. This is an encore he used to do. It's one minute long. It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor. (Music) (Applause) And that's just what the live audience did. (Applause) So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.", "id": 329, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nNinety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nNot being the musicians -- the listeners, right?\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nAnd we crave one thing,\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\neven though we kind of don't know it all the time.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nWe crave to be in the room with the musician\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nthe day it was recorded, the day it was played.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nBut then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd it turns out the further back you go in history,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nthe little rougher it sounds.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nAnd so we said, there's a solution to this.\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nLet's separate the performance, as a thing,\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nout from the recording, which was how it was made.\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nYou know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nBut the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand what instruments they were using.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nAnd it's the data hidden inside the recording.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nIn order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nthat runs in a very high resolution.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nAnd Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nthat looks like a nice grand piano there.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nbut full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nand all this kind of stuff.

[Unclear] That's the two together.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:50.958\n(Music)\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBefore \"Jurassic Park,\"\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthere was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nSo, in the video world,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nwe've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd this is kind of another example\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nof putting a science behind natural behavior.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nAnd then you heard the original.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nUltimately, I started with the experience.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nLots of you can afford to buy one of these.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nBut, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\ngo down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nIt's so involving compared to regular stereo.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nBut if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd so on the same disk we have five recordings --\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSony has five recordings.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd you could listen in headphones\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nwith this thing called binaural recording.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAnd it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nand it's got microphones where the ears are.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nyou're inside of Glenn Gould's body.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nAnd it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nwho are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\n\"I can't believe it!

easily.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nYour eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAll right, there's this episode of \"Star Trek.\"\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nI get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe episode of \"Star Trek\" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nremember this one?\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd at some point he's dancing with his --\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nand I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nRight, do you know where I'm going?\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nAnd Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nAnd then Spock turns round, he goes,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n\"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nand I don't believe this is one of them in the category.\"\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nThat's where I'm at.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nI want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nI want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nthat we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nagain, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nIt's now coming in this world.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nThe transition will be this one.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nIt says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnd I believe this is coming.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nBecause what you've just heard was a computer playing data --\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nno Glenn Gould in the room.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nBut yet, it was human.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nAnd I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nEvery time you listen to a recording today,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nevery time you take out your iPod and whatever,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nevery time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nWouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nThis morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthe same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nYou want to hear it played by different musicians.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nYou want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nWe've seen all these \"Star Treks,\" and they're all holodeck episodes as well.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nEvery time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nIt's so amazing, it's so exciting.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nEvery time I listen to that recording it's like, \"Oh my God,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nI can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.\"\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nIt's a way better experience\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nthan whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nAnd lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nSo I've really overshot my budget here.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe made a new recording of him\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nplaying in the Shrine Auditorium in September.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIt was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nAnd I've got to tell you, we have this lab\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nwhere we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand we flew out to Los Angeles.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd as the president of the company,\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nI didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nThat's a real uncomfortable feeling,\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nwhen all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nand people are going to be sitting there in the audience.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nwhich has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nAnd on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nand every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nwas perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nAnd we captured all that data all over again.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd I want you to hear that right now.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nAnd fortunately, it's right in here.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThis is an encore he used to do.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nIt's one minute long.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nIt's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:13:18.958\n(Music)\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:19.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nAnd that's just what the live audience did.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nSo thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity."}, {"title": "Kids can teach themselves", "duration": "1259", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_shows_how_kids_teach_themselves", "transcript": "I have a tough job to do. You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here, with their connotations and design, in all its forms, and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you, I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context. In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas \u2014 it's like four pieces of a puzzle. And if I succeed in doing that, maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education. Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things. Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center, you get to remoter areas. What happens to education? The second, or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world, you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas, which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city, so it's us and them. What happens to education in that context? So keep both of those ideas of remoteness.We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers. If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers. They do not have good enough infrastructure. And if they had some infrastructure, they have difficulty maintaining it. But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph. The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully. I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it. But it was quite obvious, quite clear, that for this particular route that I had taken, the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be. That seemed a little damning, and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure, or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.To my surprise, it did not correlate. It did not correlate with the size of classrooms. It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure. It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate. But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers \u2014 which was, \"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?\" \u2014 69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that, they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi, and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi \u2014 because, you know, those are relatively better off areas \u2014 and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes. I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school, probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results. So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools, as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat, and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing. It appears that way.When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that, you know, things like websites, collaborative environments \u2014 you've been listening to all that in the morning \u2014 it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools, and, according to me, biases the result. The literature \u2014 one part of it, the scientific literature \u2014 consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing. The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does. Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do. You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent. So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it. If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent \u2014 that will be a completely different thing. So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make, would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top, but we seem to be doing it the other way about.So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first, not the other way about. And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception? Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology, the teacher's first reaction is, you cannot replace a teacher with a machine \u2014 it's impossible. I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment, if you did assume that it's impossible \u2014 I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo, and he said something which completely solves this problem. He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be. So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think. Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education, whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist, where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason. If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies, then you don't need an alternative education. So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area, but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem, because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools. There are such areas, but \u2014 anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.I'm going to talk about children and self-organization, and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like. They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments. I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments. The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999. And what we did over there was pretty much simple. I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum, so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum. They cut a hole inside that wall \u2014 which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall \u2014 and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end, a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall, put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there, put it on Altavista.com \u2014 in those days \u2014 and just left it there.And this is what we saw. So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall. About eight hours later, we found this kid. To the right is this eight-year-old child who \u2014 and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall. And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse. So it sort of raised more questions than it answered. Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English? Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it \u2014 and did anyone teach them? The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it, this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India, where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything. (Laughter) So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there; he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout. He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad. Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen \u2014 and later on he told me, \"I have never seen a television where you can do something.\" So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television. And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad \u2014 you'll see him do that. He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page. Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen, and he was browsing: he was going back and forth. When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here. And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing. So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there.So we thought that this is what was happening: that children in groups can self-instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances? At this time there was a \u2014 the main question was about English. People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages. So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language? That's not possible. So, it has to be the other way about. But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language? I took the experiment out to northeastern India, to a village called Madantusi, where, for some reason, there was no English teacher, so the children had not learned English at all. And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall. One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums: there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk. In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away. I left the computer there with lots of CDs \u2014 I didn't have any Internet \u2014 and came back three months later. So when I came back there, I found these two kids, eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer. And as soon as they saw me they said, \"We need a faster processor and a better mouse.\" (Laughter) I was real surprised. You know, how on earth did they know all this? And they said, \"Well, we've picked it up from the CDs.\" So I said, \"But how did you understand what's going on over there?\" So they said, \"Well, you've left this machine which talks only in English, so we had to learn English.\" So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other \u2014 mispronounced, but correct usage \u2014 words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing, not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations. So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to.Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else. India is a good place to do such an experiment in, because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the \u2014 you know, the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities, and also all the socio-economic diversities. So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world. So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India. This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold. I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs, so I needed different climates, for which India is also great, because we have very cold, very hot, and so on. This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border. And you see here a little clip of \u2014 one of these villages \u2014 the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet.Then to central India \u2014 very warm, moist, fishing villages, where humidity is a very big killer of electronics. So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power, so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running. I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again. This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old, telling his eldest sister what to do. And this happens very often with these computers, that the younger children are found teaching the older ones.What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure. So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence. I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups. And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group, because all of you are talking about groups. So here was the power of what a group of children can do, if you lift the adult intervention.Just a quick idea of the measurements. We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that. But we got a clean learning curve, almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school. I'll leave it at that, because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it? What could they learn to do? Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email, games and educational material, music downloads, playing video. In short, what all of us do. And over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.So, how do they do that? If you calculated the actual time of access, it would work out to minutes per day, so that's not how it's happening. What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer. And surrounding him are usually three other children, who are advising him on what they should do. If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them. Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children, who are also advising, usually wrongly, about everything that's going on on the computer. And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject. So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing. It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning, but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told, don't do this, you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle. So what does the eight-year-old do? He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched. And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic. So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.So what was the conclusion over the six years of work? It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own. It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards. It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you, that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly, I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India, and asked them \u2014 I gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions. We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know. I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes \u2014 so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements. These were areas where the children were clearly confused, because half said yes and half said no. A typical example being, \"Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.\" They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question; perhaps none of us do. So I leave you with this third question. Can technology alter the acquisition of values? Finally, self-organizing systems, about which, again, I won't say too much because you've been hearing all about it. Natural systems are all self-organizing: galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies \u2014 except for the debate about an intelligent designer. But at this point in time, as far as science goes, it's self-organization. But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency. And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.So here are my four sentences then. Remoteness affects the quality of education. Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first, and other areas later. Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed \u2014 the two opposing mechanisms. And learning is most likely a self-organizing system. If you put all the four together, then it gives \u2014 according to me \u2014 it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology. An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized. As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it. PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology, but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations. We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself. I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs, and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that. And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness, values and violence. So I thought I'd give it a name \u2014 why don't we call it \"outdoctrination.\" And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future? So I want to leave that as a thought with you.Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 175, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI have a tough job to do.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nYou know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nwith their connotations and design, in all its forms,\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nand with so much and so many people working\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.958\non collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nI wanted to build an argument for primary education\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nin a very specific context.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.958\nIn order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --\n\n00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nit's like four pieces of a puzzle.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nAnd if I succeed in doing that,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nmaybe you would go back with the thought\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nthat you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nThe first piece of the puzzle is remoteness\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nand the quality of education.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nNow, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nOf course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nthat as you go further and further away\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nfrom an urban center, you get to remoter areas.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nWhat happens to education?\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThe second, or a different kind of remoteness\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nis that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nyou have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nwhich are socially and economically remote\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nfrom the rest of the city, so it's us and them.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nWhat happens to education in that context?\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nSo keep both of those ideas of remoteness.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nWe made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.958\ndo not have good enough teachers.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nIf they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\nThey do not have good enough infrastructure.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nAnd if they had some infrastructure,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nthey have difficulty maintaining it.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nBut I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nwe hired a car, looked up on Google,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nfound a route into northern India from New Delhi\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nwhich, you know, which did not cross any big cities\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nor any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nand wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nand then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nThe graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nI mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nBut it was quite obvious, quite clear,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nthat for this particular route that I had taken,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthe remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nThat seemed a little damning,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nand I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nor with the availability of electricity, and things like that.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nTo my surprise, it did not correlate.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIt did not correlate with the size of classrooms.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nIt did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nIt did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nBut what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nto each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\n\"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?\" --\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nthey say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nand they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nbecause, you know, those are relatively better off areas --\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nevery day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nprobably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nSo it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nwas a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nas opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nand whether they are packed tightly into classrooms\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand that sort of thing. It appears that way.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nWhen you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nyou know, things like websites, collaborative environments --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nyou've been listening to all that in the morning --\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nit's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand, according to me, biases the result.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThe literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nconsistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThe teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nBecause it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nlet's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nYou put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nSo the principal looks at it and says,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\n3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nIf you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhere the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nthat will be a completely different thing.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nSo the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwould be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nbut we seem to be doing it the other way about.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nSo I came to this conclusion that ET should reach\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthe underprivileged first, not the other way about.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nWhenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthe teacher's first reaction is,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nyou cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nI don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nif you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nthe science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand he said something which completely solves this problem.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHe said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nSo, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nAnyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nwhatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwhere schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nor where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nIf you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nthen you don't need an alternative education.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nSo far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nbut somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nbecause we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nThere are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else.\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nI'm going to talk about children and self-organization,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nand a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nof what might an alternative education be like.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nThey're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nI'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nThe first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nAnd what we did over there was pretty much simple.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nso there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nThey cut a hole inside that wall --\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwhich is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nso that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\na touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nput it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nput it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nAnd this is what we saw.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nSo that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAbout eight hours later, we found this kid.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nTo the right is this eight-year-old child who --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nAnd what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nSo it sort of raised more questions than it answered.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nIs this real? Does the language matter,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nbecause he's not supposed to know English?\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nWill the computer last, or will they break it and steal it\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\n-- and did anyone teach them?\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThe last question is what everybody said, but you know,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nI mean, they must have poked their head over the wall\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nand asked the people in your office,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\ncan you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nSo I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nthis time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nwhere I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nSo it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nwas on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nhe later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nHe came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nVery quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nsomething moves on the screen --\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand later on he told me, \"I have never seen a television\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwhere you can do something.\"\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo he figured that out. It took him over two minutes\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nto figure out that he was doing things to the television.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nAnd then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nby hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nHe did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nEight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand he was browsing: he was going back and forth.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nWhen that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nlike, children would come and see what's happening over here.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nAnd by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nSo eight minutes and an embedded computer\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nseemed to be all that we needed there.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nSo we thought that this is what was happening:\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nthat children in groups can self-instruct themselves\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nto use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nAt this time there was a -- the main question was about English.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nPeople said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSo I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\ninto some Indian language? That's not possible.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nSo, it has to be the other way about.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nBut let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI took the experiment out to northeastern India,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nto a village called Madantusi,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:30.958\nwhere, for some reason, there was no English teacher,\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nso the children had not learned English at all.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nOne big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nthere were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nIn the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nI left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand came back three months later.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nSo when I came back there, I found these two kids,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\neight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd as soon as they saw me they said,\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n\"We need a faster processor and a better mouse.\"\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nI was real surprised.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nYou know, how on earth did they know all this?\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nAnd they said, \"Well, we've picked it up from the CDs.\"\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSo I said, \"But how did you understand what's going on over there?\"\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo they said, \"Well, you've left this machine\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nwhich talks only in English, so we had to learn English.\"\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nSo then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\n-- mispronounced, but correct usage --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nwords like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nnot only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nSo, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nin fact they may be able to teach themselves the language\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nif they really wanted to.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nFinally, I got some funding to try this experiment out\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nto see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIndia is a good place to do such an experiment in,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nbecause we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nthe genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand also all the socio-economic diversities.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nSo, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat would cover practically the whole world.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nSo I did this for almost five years, and this experiment\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nreally took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThis is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nI also had to check or invent an engineering design\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nwhich would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nso I needed different climates, for which India is also great,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nbecause we have very cold, very hot, and so on.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nThis is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nthe first thing that these children did was to find a website\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nto teach themselves the English alphabet.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nThen to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nwhere humidity is a very big killer of electronics.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nSo we had to solve all the problems we had\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nwithout air conditioning and with very poor power,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nso most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nput at the right places to keep the machines running.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nI want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nThis sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\ntelling his eldest sister what to do.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nAnd this happens very often with these computers,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nthat the younger children are found teaching the older ones.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nWhat did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nin a connected environment,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nirrespective of anything that we could measure.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nSo if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nI couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nAnd that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nbecause all of you are talking about groups.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nSo here was the power of what a group of children can do,\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nif you lift the adult intervention.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nJust a quick idea of the measurements.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nWe took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nBut we got a clean learning curve,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nalmost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nI'll leave it at that,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nbecause, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nWhat could they learn to do?\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nBasic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ngames and educational material, music downloads, playing video.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nIn short, what all of us do.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd over 300 children will become computer literate\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nand be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nSo, how do they do that?\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nIf you calculated the actual time of access,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nit would work out to minutes per day,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nso that's not how it's happening.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nWhat you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd surrounding him are usually three other children,\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nwho are advising him on what they should do.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nIf you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nAround these four are usually a group of about 16 children,\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nwho are also advising, usually wrongly,\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nabout everything that's going on on the computer.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nAnd all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nSo they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nIt seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nbut remember, eight-year-olds live in a society\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nwhere most of the time they are told, don't do this,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nyou know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nSo what does the eight-year-old do?\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.958\nHe observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.\n\n00:17:03.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nAnd if you tested him,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nhe would answer every question correctly on that topic.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nSo, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nSo what was the conclusion over the six years of work?\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:19.958\nIt was that primary education can happen on its own,\n\n00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nor parts of it can happen on its own.\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nIt does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nIt could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nthe second bit that I wanted to tell you,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nthat children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nThe third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nI conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nand asked them -- I gave them about 68 different\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nvalues-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nWe got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nI simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nso I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nThese were areas where the children were clearly confused,\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nbecause half said yes and half said no.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nA typical example being, \"Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.\"\n\n00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nThey don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nperhaps none of us do.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nSo I leave you with this third question.\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nCan technology alter the acquisition of values?\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nFinally, self-organizing systems,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nabout which, again, I won't say too much\n\n00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:40.958\nbecause you've been hearing all about it.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nNatural systems are all self-organizing:\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\ngalaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nexcept for the debate about an intelligent designer.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nBut at this point in time, as far as science goes,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:52.958\nit's self-organization.\n\n00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nBut other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nand disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nAnd you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo here are my four sentences then.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nRemoteness affects the quality of education.\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nEducational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nand other areas later.\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nValues are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nthe two opposing mechanisms.\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nAnd learning is most likely a self-organizing system.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nIf you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nit gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nAn educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:54.958\nfault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.\n\n00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nAs educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nPowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:06.958\nbut it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.\n\n00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:10.958\nWe borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nI think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nand I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:21.958\nAnd such a set of specs should produce the technology\n\n00:20:21.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nto address remoteness, values and violence.\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nSo I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it \"outdoctrination.\"\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nAnd could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nSo I want to leave that as a thought with you.\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:39.958\nThank you.\n\n00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:45.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How I became an activist", "duration": "998", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ory_okolloh_on_becoming_an_activist", "transcript": "So what's image got do with it? And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages, because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up. But I'm going to try and do something different, and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories, and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about. So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see. We're not the only ones.(Laughter)(Applause)And you know, it's amazing. I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent. Just think about that, you know? And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff. Now, why is that a problem? A typical disaster story: disease, corruption, poverty. And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, \"OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated, and all you privileged people come here, saying, 'Forget the poor people. Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' \" And they're all, \"There's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help.\"And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK? And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here. We start with poverty. I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money, or being able to support family. Euvin was talking about bellwether signs. The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast. You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages. When things were bad, we had porridge. And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents, and things were always dicey. Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free.And they adopted a very interesting approach to education, which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford. So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career. And what happened was, because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not, I got kicked out pretty much every term. You know, someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid. And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school? Because you know, as a kid you're embarrassed and you're sensitive, and everyone knows you guys don't have money. But they kept at it, and I now understand why they did what they did.They talk about corruption. In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school. And there's national schools, which are like the best schools, and provincial schools. My dream school at that time was Kenya High School, a national school. I missed the cutoff by one point. And I was so disappointed, and I was like, \"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?\" And my father said, \"OK, listen. Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress. You know, it's just one point. I mean, maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.\" So we went to the school, and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege, and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt. And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying, you know, who do you think you are? And, you know, you must be joking if you think you can get a slot. And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians, and who had done much, much worse than I did, and they had slots there. And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know? And we left, and I swore to myself, and I was like, \"I'm never, ever going to have to beg for anything in my life.\" They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.(Laughter) (Applause)Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly. Disease. My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999. He never told anyone that he had AIDS, his fear of the stigma was so strong. And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd. And I was in the States at the time, and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick. And he had Cryptococcal meningitis. And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know. Because of doctor-patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on. But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing. And when I went online and looked at the infectious \u2014 read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.The first time he got sick, he recovered. But what happened was that he had to be on medication that, at that time \u2014 Diflucan, which in the States is used for yeast infections \u2014 cost 30 dollars a pill. He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life. You know, so money ran out. He got sick again. And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India, and he used to import, bring him, could get him a generic version of it. And that kept him going. But the money ran out. He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday. At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya, and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday. The hospital put him on a water drip for three days. And finally, we figured, well, OK, we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital. At least he'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation. And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him.And, you know, now, imagine if \u2014 and I could go on and on \u2014 imagine if this is all you know about me. How would you look at me? With pity, you know. Sadness. And this is how you look at Africa. This is the damage it causes. You don't see the other side of me. You don't see the blogger, you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know? And I just wanted to personalize that. Because we talk about it in big terms, and you wonder, you know, so what? But it's damaging. And I'm not unique, right? Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village. And you didn't know about the windmill, you know? And I was just moved. I was actually crying during his presentation. He was like, I try and I make. I was like Nike should hire him, you know, \"Just do it!\"(Laughter)And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make. When you focus just on the disasters \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014 we're ignoring the potential. So, what is to be done? First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories. We heard about that yesterday. We had some of them this morning. And this is an example, you know, blogging is one way of doing that. Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa. So we need to start getting better. If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it. And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia. Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa. It only has five contributors. Four of them are white males \u2014 non-native speakers. The other person is \u2014 Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up \u2014 is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger. He's the only African who's contributing to this.People, please. We can't whine and complain the West is doing this. What are we doing? Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers? Why are we not generating our own content? You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act. Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa. So, that's a start, and we've heard of all their other initiatives. The cheetah generation. The aid approach, you know, is flawed. And after all the hoopla of Live 8, we're still not anywhere in the picture. No, you're not.(Laughter)But the point I'm trying to make, though, is that it's not enough for us to criticize. And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, should I move back, should I stay? You know, just jump. The continent needs you. And I can't emphasize that enough, you know. I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C., Covington and Burling, six figures. With two paychecks, or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems. But I walked away from that, because my passion was here, and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling. And because I'm needed here, you know? I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing.One is because I'm pretty aggressive, and I try and find, you know, opportunities. But there is such a need, you know? I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa. We're now moving into East Africa. And we give them business development services, as well as financing loan and equity. I've also set up a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs. My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress. It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting. Everything else on there is a labor of love. We've manually entered all the data there. And you can get profiles of each MP, questions they've asked in parliament. We have a comment function, where people can ask their MPs questions. There are some MPs who participate, and come back and ask.And basically, we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians. You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand. You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart. And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders. What are they doing? You know, they're not going to change just out of nowhere. So we need new policies, we need \u2014 where's that coming from, you know? Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society. We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars, you know? They come from us. And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like? And how can we change that? So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable. Where do we go from here? I believe in the power of ideas. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share, and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going, because it can make a difference. The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual. I've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa. People are like, \"OK, if you don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?\" And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, \"BBut it's not scalable, you know. Give me something I can do with Paypal.\" It's not that easy, you know? And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual, in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met, it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa, because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them. Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her. My sister was struggling to get through undergrad. I was helping her pay her tuition. My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart. I was paying her school fees.A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan, so we said, well, what are we going to do with her? You know, she's now my baby sister. And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I am able to lift all those people. So, don't underestimate that. An example. This man changed my life. He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt. He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson. And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School, because he took an interest. I was taking a class of his, and he was just like, this is an overeager student, which we don't normally get in the United States, because everyone else is cynical and jaded. He called me to his office and said, \"What do you want to do when you grow up?\" I said, \"I want to be a lawyer.\" And he was like, \"Why? You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States.\" And he tried to talk me out of it, but it was like, \"OK, I know nothing about applying to law school, I'm poli-sci Ph.D. But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, what I need to do to help you out.\"It was like, \"Where do you want to go?\" And to me at that time university \u2014 I was at University of Pitts for undergrad, and that was like heaven, OK, because compared to what could have been in Kenya. So I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.\" He was like, \"Why? You know, you're smart, you have all these things going for you.\" And I'm like, \"Because I'm here and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh.\" Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for applying to law school. And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me. And he said, \"Look, you can get into Harvard, you're that good, OK? And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up.\" And he built me up, you know? And this is just an illustration.You can meet other individuals here. We just need a push. That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level. Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know? A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential. You know, my vision is that my daughter, and any other African child being born today, can be whoever they want to be here, without having to leave. And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born. That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know? That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances, and you can move. Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are. For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born, and the circumstances under which you were born, determine the rest of your life. I would like to see that change, and the change starts with us. And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent. Thank you.(Applause)", "id": 330, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nSo what's image got do with it?\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nAnd I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:17.958\na lot of subliminal messages,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbecause I'm going to keep harping on

just close the loop with some of my personal stories,\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nand try and put a face to a lot of the issues\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nSo, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nas you can see.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nWe're not the

know?\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nAnd this is typically what we've been talking about,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthe role that the media plays in focusing\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\njust on the negative stuff.\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nNow, why is that a problem?\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nA typical disaster story:\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\ndisease, corruption, poverty.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nAnd some of you might be standing here thinking,\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nsaying, \"OK, you know, Ory, you're

without having money,\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nor being able to support family.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nEuvin was talking about bellwether signs.\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nThe bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nYou know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nWhen things were bad, we had porridge.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nAnd like many African families,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nmy parents could never save\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nbecause they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nand things were always dicey.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nNow, when I was born,

you know, what am I going to do?\"\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nAnd my father said, \"OK, listen.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nLet's go and try and talk to the headmistress.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nYou know, it's just one point. I mean,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nmaybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.\"\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo we went to the school,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand because my father didn't have the right last name,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nhe was treated like dirt.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nAnd I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nyou know, who do you think you are?\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd, you know, you must be joking if you think\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nyou can get a slot.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nand who had done much, much worse than I did,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nand they had slots there.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd there's nothing worse than seeing your parent\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nbeing humiliated in front of you, you know?\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nAnd we left, and I swore to myself,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand I was like, \"I'm never, ever going to have\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nto beg for anything in my life.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nThey called me two weeks later, they're like,\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:43.958\noh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nFinal story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nDisease.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nMy father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nHe never told anyone that he had AIDS,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nhis fear of the stigma was so strong.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd I was in the States at the time,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nand they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd he had Cryptococcal meningitis.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nAnd so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nBecause of doctor-patient privilege,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nthey couldn't really tell us what was going on.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nBut they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nAnd when I went online and looked at the infectious --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nread about the disease,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nI pretty much realized what was going on.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThe first time he got sick, he recovered.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nBut what happened was that he had to be on medication\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthat, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nis used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nHe had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nYou know, so money ran out.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nHe got sick again.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand he used to import, bring him, could\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nget him a generic version of it.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd that kept him going.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nBut the money ran out.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nHe got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nAt that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nand we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nfor him to start the treatment until Monday.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nThe hospital put him on a water drip for three days.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd finally, we figured, well, OK,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nwe'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nAt least he'll get treated\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nwhile we try to figure out the money situation.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAnd he died when the ambulance was coming\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nto the hospital to take him.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nimagine if this is all you know about me.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nHow would you look at me?\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nWith pity, you know. Sadness.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nAnd this is how you look at Africa.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThis is the damage it causes.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nYou don't see the other side of me.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nYou don't see the blogger,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nyou don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthe vibrant person, you know?\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd I just wanted to personalize that.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBecause we talk about it in big terms,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand you wonder, you know, so what?\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nBut it's damaging.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nAnd I'm not unique, right?\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nImagine if all you knew about William\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nwas the fact that he grew up in a poor village.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd you didn't know about the windmill, you know?\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nAnd I was just moved.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI was actually crying during his presentation.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nHe was like, I try and I make.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nI was like Nike should hire him, you know, \"Just do it!\"\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nWhen you focus just on the disasters --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:08:01.958\n(Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\n-- we're ignoring the potential.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo, what is to be done?\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nFirst of all,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAfricans, we need to get better at telling our stories.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nWe heard about that yesterday.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nWe had some of them this morning.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd this is an example, you know,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nblogging is one way of doing that.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAfrigator is an aggregator of African blogs\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nthat was developed in South Africa.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nSo we need to start getting better.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nAnd going back to the point I was trying to make,\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nthis is the Swahili Wikipedia.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSwahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nIt only has five contributors.\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nFour of them are white males -- non-native speakers.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nThe other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nis a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nHe's the only African who's contributing to this.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nPeople, please. We can't whine and complain\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthe West is doing this.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nWhat are we doing?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nWhere are the rest of the Swahili speakers?\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nWhy are we not generating our own content?\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nYou know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nReuters now integrates African blogs\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\ninto their coverage of Africa.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nSo, that's a start,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand we've heard of all their other initiatives.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nThe cheetah generation.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nThe aid approach, you know, is flawed.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd after all the hoopla of Live 8,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nwe're still not anywhere in the picture.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nNo, you're not.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nBut the point I'm trying to make, though,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nis that it's not enough for us to criticize.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd for those of you in the diaspora\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nwho are struggling with where should I be,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nshould I move back,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nshould I stay?\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou know, just jump.\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThe continent needs you.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd I can't emphasize that enough, you know.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nI walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nCovington and Burling, six figures.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nWith two paychecks, or three paychecks,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nI could solve a lot of my family's problems.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nBut I walked away from that, because my passion was here,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nand because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nAnd because I'm needed here, you know?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nI probably can win a prize for the most ways\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nto use a Harvard Law School degree\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nbecause of all the things I'm doing.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nOne is because I'm pretty aggressive,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nand I try and find, you know, opportunities.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nBut there is such a need, you know?\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nI'm a corporate lawyer most of the time\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nfor an organization called Enablis\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nthat supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nWe're now moving into East Africa.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd we give them business development services,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nas well as financing loan and equity.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nI've also set up a project in Kenya,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nand what we do is we track the performance\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nof Kenyan MPs.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nMy partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nIt costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nEverything else on there is a labor of love.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe've manually entered all the data there.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd you can get profiles of each MP,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nquestions they've asked in parliament.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe have a comment function,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nwhere people can ask their MPs questions.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nThere are some MPs who participate,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nand come back and ask.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAnd basically, we started this because we were tired\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nof complaining about our politicians.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nYou know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nYou're not just going to be accountable\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nout of the goodness of your heart.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nWhat are they doing?\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nYou know, they're not going to change\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\njust out of nowhere.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nSo we need new policies, we need --\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nwhere's that coming from, you know?\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnother thing is that these leaders\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nare a reflection of our society.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe talk about African governments\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nlike they've been dropped from Mars, you know?\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nThey come from us.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd how can we change that?\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nSo Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\ninspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nWhere do we go from here?\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nI believe in the power of ideas.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nI believe in the power of sharing knowledge.\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nbecause it can make a difference.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThe other thing I want to urge you to do\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nis take an interest in the individual.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nI've had lots of conversations about things I think\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nneed to be happening in Africa.\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nPeople are like, \"OK, if you don't do aid,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nI'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?\"\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAnd when I talk about my ideas, they're like,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n\"BBut it's not scalable, you know.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nGive me something I can do with Paypal.\"\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nIt's not that easy, you know?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nAnd sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nin the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nit can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nbecause usually the individual in Africa\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\ncarries a lot of people behind them.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nPractically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nmy mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nMy sister was struggling to get through undergrad.\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nI was helping her pay her tuition.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nMy cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nI was paying her school fees.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nA cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nso we said, well, what are we going to do with her?\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nYou know, she's now my baby sister.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nAnd because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nI am able to lift all those people.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nSo, don't underestimate that.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nAn example. This man changed my life.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nHe's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nHe's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nbecause he took an interest.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nI was taking a class of his, and he was just like,\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nthis is an overeager student,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nwhich we don't normally get in the United States,\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nbecause everyone else is cynical and jaded.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nHe called me to his office and said,\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\n\"What do you want to do when you grow up?\"\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nI said, \"I want to be a lawyer.\"\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nAnd he was like, \"Why? You know,\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nwe don't need another lawyer in the United States.\"\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd he tried to talk me out of it,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbut it was like, \"OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nI'm poli-sci Ph.D.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nBut, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nwhat I need to do to help you out.\"\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt was like, \"Where do you want to go?\"\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nAnd to me at that time university --\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nI was at University of Pitts for undergrad,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nand that was like heaven, OK,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nbecause compared to what could have been in Kenya.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nSo I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.\"\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nHe was like, \"Why? You know, you're smart,\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nyou have all these things going for you.\"\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd I'm like, \"Because I'm here and it's cheap,\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nand you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh.\"\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nLike, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nfor applying to law school.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nAnd he said, \"Look, you can get into Harvard,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nyou're that good, OK?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nAnd if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up.\"\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nAnd he built me up, you know?\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nAnd this is just an illustration.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nYou can meet other individuals here.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nWe just need a push.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThat's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBasically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nA gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nof us having to leave the continent\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nso that we can fulfill our potential.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nYou know, my vision is that my daughter,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nand any other African child being born today,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\ncan be whoever they want to be here,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nwithout having to leave.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd they can have the possibility of transcending\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nthe circumstances under which they were born.\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nThat's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nThat you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand you can move.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nJust because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nthat doesn't define who you are.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nFor most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand the circumstances under which you were born,\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\ndetermine the rest of your life.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nI would like to see that change,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nand the change starts with us.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nAnd as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThank you.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "A talking, squawking parrot", "duration": "348", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/einstein_the_parrot_talks_and_squawks", "transcript": "Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody. Can you tell everybody your name?Einstein: Einstein.SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone \"hi\"?E: Hello.SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?E: Hi, sweetheart.SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006, amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited.E: Woo.SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference. This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers?E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk. A lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty.E: Achoo!SW: It could make her sneeze. But more importantly, her research could help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.Einstein: [Coughs]SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level. Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited. (Laughter) That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird, she's very interested in things that fly. She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.E: Ooh.SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship? E: [Spaceship noise] SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?E: [Laser noise] (Laughter)SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein. Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves and travelling through space \u2014 it's all very dangerous jobs. It would be very dangerous if you fell down.E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]SW: Yeah. (Laughter) Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt?E: Ow, ow, ow.SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.E: [Squawks]SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public, she loves to take in the arts. If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner, Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance. Can you get down? E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter) SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now. She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.SW: Do your head now.E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. (Laughter)SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?E: [Operatic squawk]SW: Very good. (Laughter) Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer? Einstein, can you also sing? I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?E: La, la.SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails, you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.E: [Squawks]SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier, but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.E: What's the matter?SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember? You were saying that you were really embarrassed, because you're in love with a pirate?E: Yar.SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink?E: Beer. SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein. You like to drink water.E: [Water sound]SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous. Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here, and she's pretty nervous to meet him. She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man. What do you say to a good-looking man?E: Hey, baby. (Laughter)SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.E: Yee haw. (Laughter)SW: And since she's such a big fan, she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March. And we didn't think he'd be in town then, so Einstein wanted to do something special for him. So let's see if Einstein will sing \"Happy Birthday\" to Al Gore. Can you sing \"Happy Birthday\" to him?E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Again.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Again.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Big finish.E: Happy birthday to you.SW: Good job! (Applause) Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo. Einstein, do you want to say \"hi\" to all the owls?E: Woo, woo, woo.SW: What about the other birds?E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.SW: And the penguin?E: Quack, quack, quack. SW: There we go. (Laughter) Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.SW: Very good. (Laughter) What about a wolf?E: Ooooowww.SW: And a pig?E: Oink, oink, oink.SW: And the rooster?E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!SW: And how about those cats?E: Meow. (Laughter)SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.E: Grrrrr. (Laughter)SW: What about a skunk?E: Stinker. (Laughter)SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?E: Superstar.SW: Yeah. You are a superstar. (Laughter) Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in]. Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her. Why do we want to protect your home?E: I'm special.SW: You are very special. What would you like to say to all these nice people?E: I love you.SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?E: [Kissing noise]SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?E: Goodbye.SW: Good job.

They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution. And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you. I will say that life involves computation. So this is a computer program. Booted up in a cell, the program would execute, and it could result in this person; or with a small change, it could result in this person; or another small change, this person; or with a larger change, this dog, or this tree, or this whale.So now, if you take this metaphor [of] genome as program seriously, you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson, Craig Venter, as are all of us. And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true, there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you. But one, to me, that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development \u2014 the output. A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly. Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be. Or if you're familiar with \"The Princess Bride,\" it could create a six-fingered man.Now, a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. If your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit, you could end up with a thousand dollars. So these small changes are things that I think that \u2014 they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified, large changes.So now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology, and it shows the power of molecular programs \u2014 biology does. And what I want to do is write molecular programs, potentially to build technology. And there are a lot of people doing this, a lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter. And they concentrate on using cells. They're cell-oriented. So my friends, molecular programmers, and I have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach. We're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein, and building new languages for building things from the bottom up, using biomolecules, potentially having nothing to do with biology. So, these are all the machines in a cell. There's a camera. There's the solar panels of the cell, some switches that turn your genes on and off, the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles. My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest, easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. And as other things become easier to use \u2014 maybe protein \u2014 we'll work with those.If we succeed, what will molecular programming look like? You're going to sit in front of your computer. You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone. Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed. And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately, is it will do a developmental computation, a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer. And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already, I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers, building electronic computers, which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers, which will build new electronic computers, and so forth.And if you buy all of this, and you think life is about computation, as I do, then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. So one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing? And for molecular programming, the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing? (Laughter) Or how does a computer program know when to stop running? Or more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop? There are other questions like this, too. One of them is Craig Venter's question. Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist. He asked, how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism? How few genes can I use? This is exactly analogous to the question, what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word? (Laughter) And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller, he's writing genomes that will work, we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does.But for molecular programming, our question is, how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone? What's the smallest number we can get away with? Now, these are big questions in computer science. These are all complexity questions, and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions. Almost \u2014 many of them are impossible. But for some tasks, we can start to answer them. So, I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA. It's double-stranded, it's a double helix, has the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together. And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes, just so I don't scare you. We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix. When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded, so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube, and they're floppy when they're single-stranded. You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix. Now for the last 25 years, Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together. But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time. They can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop. But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA, which is technically very difficult to get. So, you can go to a natural source. You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact, and he's got a double-stranded genome \u2014 that's no good. You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. They're no good either. Double strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus that has a nice, long, single-stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper. And here's how we do it.This is part of that genome. We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples. Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place, and a right half that binds it in a different place, and brings the long strand together like this. The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle.Now, we can't actually take a movie of this process, but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. And what happens is that we mix these strands together. We heat them up, we add a little bit of salt, we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down, and as we cool them down, the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure. And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there. When you look at DNA origami, you can see that what it really is, even though you think it's complicated, is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other, and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. So there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds \u2014 it jumps to another helix and comes back. That holds the long strand like this.Now, to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted, I tried to make this shape. I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye, down the nose, up the nose, around the forehead, back down and end in a little loop like this. And so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work. So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this. I ordered them; they came by FedEx. I mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down, and I got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water. And each one of these is just one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?So, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them, you have to get them on a surface where they stick. So, you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface, and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope. It's got a needle, like a record needle, that goes back and forth over the surface, bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface. It feels the DNA origami. There's the atomic-force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. When you zoom in, they've got, you know, weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good. You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop, this little nano-goatee.Now, what's great about this is anybody can do this. And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited. Anyone know what this is? What is it? It's China, right? So, what happened is, a graduate student in China, Lulu Qian, did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami, a beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan, and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right? (Laughter) So, this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK? And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.And what's really neat about it \u2014 well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork, but it turns out that nano-artwork is just what you need to make nano-circuits. So, you can put circuit components on the staples, like a light bulb and a light switch. Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit. And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. So, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes, made a little switch, you see here, wired it up, tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. Now, this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go. But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size of those in a normal computer. So it's very promising for making small computers.Now, I want to get back to that compiler. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. So, you start with something in the computer. You get a high-level description of the computer program, a high-level description of the origami. You can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer, and it actually works. And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly, and will allow us to do this in a nice, visual, computer-aided design way.So, now you can say, all right, why isn't DNA origami the end of the story? You have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want. The fact is that it does not scale. So if you want to build a human from DNA origami, the problem is, you need a long strand that's 10 trillion trillion bases long. That's three light years' worth of DNA, so we're not going to do this. We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles. It was started by Erik Winfree, and what it does, it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands and they have little single-stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles, if they match. And we like to draw these tiles as little squares. And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits, you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. So, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard. And the point of this, if you didn't catch that, is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs \u2014 specifically, counting. So, you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together, form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard. So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.And in order to get these kinds of computations started right, you need some kind of input, a kind of seed. You can use DNA origami for that. You can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a DNA origami, and when you add those tiles that count, they will start to count \u2014 they will read that 32 and they'll stop at 32. So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. It knows when to stop growing because it can count. It knows how big it is. So, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about. It doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.So now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise. Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami, and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing. So, what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. And the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable. You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get 96 rather than 32. And if you do that, the origami's the same size, but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.So, this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes \u2014 single, tiny, little mutations \u2014 can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. Now, this \u2014 using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. So, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size? If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000, if we used DNA origami alone, we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square; so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands. That's really not affordable. But if we use a little computation \u2014 we use origami, plus some tiles that count \u2014 then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands. And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use, if we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation. And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something, to reduce the size of the genome that you're building.And finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it, the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles \u2014 rather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles \u2014 then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits, the demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory. So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation. It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer. Now, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path? Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year. Here is a DNA origami rectangle, and here are some tiles growing from it. And you can see how they count. One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17. So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up. (Laughter)So, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago, and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress. We've got ideas about how to fix these errors. And I think in the next five or 10 years, we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.So now, what do I want you to take away from this talk? I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms, life uses computation to do that. And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations, and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it, as Feynman said, you know, we need to build something to understand it. And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing, rebuild everything from the bottom up, using DNA in ways that nature never intended, using DNA origami, and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.You know, so this is all very cool, but what I'd like you to take from the talk, hopefully from some of those big questions, is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. It's not just making about \u2014 it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits. What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light, asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you.

life.\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nThey ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nAnd I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nI will say that life involves computation.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nSo this is a computer program.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\nBooted up in a cell, the program would execute,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:32.958\nand it could result in this person;\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nor with a small change, it could result in this person;\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nor another small change, this person;\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nor with a larger change, this dog,\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nor this tree, or this whale.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nSo now, if you take this metaphor\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\n[of] genome as program seriously,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nyou have to consider that Chris Anderson\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nis a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nCraig Venter, as are all of us.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nAnd in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nthere are lots of similarities between genetic programs\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand computer programs that could help to convince you.\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nBut one, to me, that's most compelling\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nis the peculiar sensitivity to small changes\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nthat can make large changes in biological development -- the output.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nA small mutation can take a two-wing fly\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nand make it a four-wing fly.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nOr it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nOr if you're familiar with \"The Princess Bride,\"\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nit could create a six-fingered man.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nNow, a hallmark of computer programs\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nis just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nIf your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nyou could end up with a thousand dollars.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nSo these small changes are things that I think\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nthat -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nin development is underlying these amplified, large changes.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nSo now, all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nand it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd what I want to do is write molecular programs,\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\npotentially to build technology.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd there are a lot of people doing this,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:56.958\na lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nAnd they concentrate on using cells.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nThey're cell-oriented.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo my friends, molecular programmers, and I\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nhave a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nWe're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein,\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand building new languages for building things from the bottom up,\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nusing biomolecules,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\npotentially having nothing to do with biology.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nSo, these are all the machines in a cell.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nThere's a camera.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nThere's the solar panels of the cell,\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nsome switches that turn your genes on and off,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nthe girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nMy little group of molecular programmers\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nare trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nWe're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\neasiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd as other things become easier to use --\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nmaybe protein -- we'll work with those.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nIf we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nYou're going to sit in front of your computer.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nYou're going to design something like a cell phone,\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nand in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nThen you're going to have a compiler\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nthat's going to take that description\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nand it's going to turn it into actual molecules\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nthat can be sent to a synthesizer\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nand that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nis it will do a developmental computation,\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\na molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nAnd if I haven't revealed my prejudices already,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nI think that life has been about molecular computers\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nbuilding electrochemical computers,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nbuilding electronic computers,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nwhich together with electrochemical computers\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwill build new molecular computers,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhich will build new electronic computers, and so forth.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd if you buy all of this,\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nand you think life is about computation, as I do,\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthen you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSo one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nAnd for molecular programming,\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nthe question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:39.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nOr how does a computer program know when to stop running?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nOr more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThere are other questions like this, too.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nOne of them is Craig Venter's question.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nTurns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nHe asked, how big is the minimal genome\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nthat will give me a functioning microorganism?\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nHow few genes can I use?\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nThis is exactly analogous to the question,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nwhat's the smallest program I can write\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat will act exactly like Microsoft Word?\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nhe's writing genomes that will work,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwe could write smaller programs\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nthat would do what Microsoft Word does.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nBut for molecular programming, our question is,\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nhow many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nWhat's the smallest number we can get away with?\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nNow, these are big questions in computer science.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThese are all complexity questions,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nand computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAlmost -- many of them are impossible.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nBut for some tasks, we can start to answer them.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nSo, I'm going to start asking those questions\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nfor the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIt's double-stranded, it's a double helix,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nhas the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd I'm going to draw it like this sometimes,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\njust so I don't scare you.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nWe want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nWhen we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nso we can take the blue strand in one tube\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand make an orange strand in the other tube,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand they're floppy when they're single-stranded.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nYou mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nNow for the last 25 years,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNed Seeman and a bunch of his descendants\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nhave worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nusing this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nBut a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nThey can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nSo I came up with a new method a couple of years ago\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nI call DNA origami\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nthat's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand design the stuff on a laptop.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nBut to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhich is technically very difficult to get.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nSo, you can go to a natural source.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nYou can look in this computer-fabricated artifact,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nand he's got a double-stranded genome -- that's no good.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nYou look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nThey're no good either.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nDouble strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nthat has a nice, long, single-stranded genome\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nthat we can fold like a piece of paper.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nAnd here's how we do it.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThis is part of that genome.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nWe add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nEach one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nand a right half that binds it in a different place,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand brings the long strand together like this.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nThe net action of many of these on that long strand\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nis to fold it into something like a rectangle.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nNow, we can't actually take a movie of this process,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nbut Shawn Douglas at Harvard\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nhas made a nice visualization for us\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nAnd what happens is that we mix these strands together.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nWe heat them up, we add a little bit of salt,\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwe heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nand as we cool them down,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nthe short strands bind the long strands\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nand start to form structure.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAnd you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWhen you look at DNA origami,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nyou can see that what it really is,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:43.958\neven though you think it's complicated,\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nis a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other,\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand they're held together\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nby places where short strands go along one helix\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand then jump to another one.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nSo there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds --\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nit jumps to another helix and comes back.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nThat holds the long strand like this.\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nNow, to show that we could make any shape or pattern\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nthat we wanted, I tried to make this shape.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nI wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\ndown the nose, up the nose, around the forehead,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nback down and end in a little loop like this.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nAnd so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nSo I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nI ordered them; they came by FedEx.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nI mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nand I got 50 billion little smiley faces\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nfloating around in a single drop of water.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd each one of these is just\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\none-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nSo, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nyou have to get them on a surface where they stick.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nSo, you pour them out onto a surface\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand they start to stick to that surface,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nIt's got a needle, like a record needle,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nthat goes back and forth over the surface,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nbumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt feels the DNA origami.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThere's the atomic-force microscope working\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand you can see that the landing's a little rough.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nWhen you zoom in, they've got, you know,\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nweak jaws that flip over their heads\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nand some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nYou can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthis little nano-goatee.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nNow, what's great about this is anybody can do this.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nAnyone know what this is? What is it?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nIt's China, right?\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nSo, what happened is, a graduate student in China,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nLulu Qian, did a great job.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nShe wrote all her own software\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nto design and built this DNA origami,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\na beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nSo, this works really well\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd what's really neat about it --\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nwell, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nbut it turns out that nano-artwork\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nis just what you need to make nano-circuits.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nSo, you can put circuit components on the staples,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nlike a light bulb and a light switch.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nLet the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nSo, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nThey took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nmade a little switch, you see here, wired it up,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\ntested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nNow, this is just a single switch\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nBut this is very promising\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nbecause the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nof those in a normal computer.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo it's very promising for making small computers.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nNow, I want to get back to that compiler.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works.\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo, you start with something in the computer.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nYou get a high-level description of the computer program,\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\na high-level description of the origami.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nYou can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand it actually works.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nAnd it turns out that a company has made a nice program\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nthat's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand will allow us to do this in a nice,\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nvisual, computer-aided design way.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nSo, now you can say, all right,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwhy isn't DNA origami the end of the story?\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nYou have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThe fact is that it does not scale.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nSo if you want to build a human from DNA origami,\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nthe problem is, you need a long strand\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat's 10 trillion trillion bases long.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nThat's three light years' worth of DNA,\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nso we're not going to do this.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nWe're going to turn to another technology,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\ncalled algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nIt was started by Erik Winfree,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nand what it does,\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nit has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nYou zoom in, there are just four DNA strands\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nand they have little single-stranded bits on them\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nthat can bind to other tiles, if they match.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd we like to draw these tiles as little squares.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nyou can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nSo, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nAnd the point of this, if you didn't catch that,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nis that tiles are a kind of molecular program\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nand they can output patterns.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nAnd a really amazing part of this is\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nthat any computer program can be translated\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\ninto one of these tile programs -- specifically, counting.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo, you can come up with a set of tiles\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nthat when they come together, form a little binary counter\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nrather than a checkerboard.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nSo you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nAnd in order to get these kinds of computations started right,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nyou need some kind of input, a kind of seed.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nYou can use DNA origami for that.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nYou can encode the number 32\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nin the right-hand side of a DNA origami,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nand when you add those tiles that count,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nthey will start to count -- they will read that 32\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand they'll stop at 32.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nSo, what we've done is we've figured out a way\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nto have a molecular program know when to stop going.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt knows when to stop growing because it can count.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nIt knows how big it is.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nSo, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nIt doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nSo now, we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthan DNA origami could otherwise.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nHere's the DNA origami, and what we can do\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nis we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand we can now use our watering can\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nand water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nand create a square.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nThe counter serves as a template\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nto fill in a square in the middle of this thing.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nSo, what we've done is we've succeeded\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nin making something much bigger than a DNA origami\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nby combining DNA origami with tiles.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nAnd the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nYou can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nand you'll get 96 rather than 32.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAnd if you do that, the origami's the same size,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nbut the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nSo, this sort of recapitulates\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwhat I was telling you about development.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nYou have a very sensitive computer program\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nwhere small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations --\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:49.958\ncan take something that made one size square\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand make something very much bigger.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nNow, this -- using counting to compute\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nand build these kinds of things\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nby this kind of developmental process\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nis something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nSo, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto build a square of a given size?\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nIf we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nif we used DNA origami alone,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nwe would require a number of DNA strands that's the square\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nof the size of that square;\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nso we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThat's really not affordable.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nBut if we use a little computation --\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nwe use origami, plus some tiles that count --\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nthen we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nif we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd so computation is some very powerful way\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nto reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nto reduce the size of the genome that you're building.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd finally, I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nabout computers building computers.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nIf you look at the square that you build with the origami\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:00.958\nand some counters growing off it,\n\n00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nthe pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nto make a memory.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nSo if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles --\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nrather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles --\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nthen they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nthe demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nSo you can actually make a complicated circuit\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nusing a little bit of computation.\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nIt's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nNow, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nExperimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nHere is a DNA origami rectangle,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nand here are some tiles growing from it.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nAnd you can see how they count.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nSo it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:53.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nSo, it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago,\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nand that's about the time constant for how long it takes\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nto do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nWe've got ideas about how to fix these errors.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nAnd I think in the next five or 10 years,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nwe'll make the kind of squares that I described\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nSo now, what do I want you to take away from this talk?\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nI want you to remember that\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nto create life's very diverse and complex forms,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nlife uses computation to do that.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nAnd the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nand in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nas Feynman said, you know,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nwe need to build something to understand it.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nrebuild everything from the bottom up,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nusing DNA in ways that nature never intended,\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nusing DNA origami,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nYou know, so this is all very cool,\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nbut what I'd like you to take from the talk,\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nhopefully from some of those big questions,\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nis that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nIt's not just making about --\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nit's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nWhat it's really about is taking computer science\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nand looking at big questions in a new light,\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nasking new versions of those big questions\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nand trying to understand how biology\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.958\ncan make such amazing things. Thank you.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:18.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Our next giant leap", "duration": "931", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_diamandis_on_our_next_giant_leap", "transcript": "My mission in life since I was a kid was, and is, to take the rest of you into space. It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth, take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting. In fact, I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier. You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy, a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere. And if you think about space, everything we hold of value on this planet \u2014 metals and minerals and real estate and energy \u2014 is in infinite quantities in space.In fact, the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources. The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska. We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly. We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill. And then we discovered these things \u2014 gold and oil and fishing and timber \u2014 and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy, and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space. We are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known.We explore for three reasons, the weakest of which is curiosity. You know, it's funded NASA's budget up until now. Some images from Mars, 1997. In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question, we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet.The stronger motivator, the much stronger motivator, is fear. It drove us to the moon. We \u2014 literally in fear \u2014 with the Soviet Union raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks, you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there, and while the probability is very small, the impact, figured in literally, of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking, searching, preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.And of course, the third motivator, one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth. In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids, there's a class of the nickel iron, which in platinum-group metal markets alone are worth something like 20 trillion dollars, if you can go out and grab one of these rocks. My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market, and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one. And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one. But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us. And for me, this is \u2014 I'm the short kid on the right. This was \u2014 my motivation was actually during Apollo.And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever. If you think about what happened at the turn of \u2014 early 1960s, on May 25, JFK said, \"We're going to go to the moon.\" And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission. And we knew nothing about going to space. We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years, and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old. They didn't know what couldn't be done. They had to make up everything. And that, my friend, is amazing motivation. This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying, \"If I can go to the moon\" \u2014 this is the last human on the moon so far \u2014 \"nothing, nothing is impossible.\" But of course, we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.But I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there. The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier. The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch. That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable. We shouldn't be happy in standing for that. One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know. As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier, we should be allowed to risk. In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know, just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward, in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us. The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals, and clearly the industrial-military complex \u2014 with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA \u2014 are the dinosaurs. The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy \u2014 we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes, you know, everything stored on our databases, and back them up off the planet, in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.The difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key. Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere \u2014 the moon, to Mars. And today, there's only three vehicles \u2014 the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz and the Chinese vehicle \u2014 that gets you there. Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle. One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket. We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars. But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is \u2014(Laughter) \u2014it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that! You know, one \u2014 we have a very unique period in time today. For the first time ever, we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration. But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point. We know \u2014 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket, but how cheap could it get?Let's go back to high school physics here. If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh, to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles, and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour \u2014 remember, that one half MV squared \u2014 and you figure it out. It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy. If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts. If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources, and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour \u2014 anybody here fast in math? How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit? 100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that \u2014 we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way, I'll grant you that.(Laughter)But guys, if history has taught us anything, it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually. I have no question that the physics, the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner. The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R&D. It's all government research dollars, and very few of those. And in fact, the large corporations, the governments, can't take the risk. So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space. Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market? 12 to 15 launches per year. Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies. One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace, and I call them self-loading carbon payloads. They come with their own money. They're easy to make. It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution, reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.We offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship, carry three people up to 100 kilometers, come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again. Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition, spending between one to 25 million dollars each. And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne, which made those two flights and won the competition. And I'd like to take you there, to that morning, for just a quick video.(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.Richard Searfoss: Good luck.(Applause)RS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.(Applause)RS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge of the Ansari X PRIZE competition, I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.(Applause)Peter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible. We went \u2014 I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs. No one believed it was done. Everyone said, \"Oh, what does NASA think? Well, people are going to die, how can you possibly going to put this forward?\" I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car, and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy. See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed, and said, \"Are you going to compete?\" No. \"Are you going to compete?\" No. \"No one's going to win this thing.\" So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05, and I took a bet that someone would win.(Applause)So \u2014 and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.(Laughter)We've had a lot of accomplishments and it's been a tremendous success. One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne is going to hang in Air and Space Museum, next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer. Isn't that great? (Applause) So a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you. Today, you can go and experience weightless flights. By '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin, is going to be about 200,000. There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly, I think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight. Orbital flights \u2014 we can take you to the space station.And then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth \u2014 I know if they don't do it, I am \u2014 we're going to stockpile some fuel, make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.(Laughter)Quick moment for the designers in the audience. We spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights. Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity \u2014 people think a zero gravity room, there's a switch on there that turns it off \u2014 but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane. And turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month. If we can get the audio up?(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space, look for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up. When you want the taste that won't weigh you down, the only way to go is up.PD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this. We're based down in Florida. Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about. The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea. I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward. And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas, and we just took on a new mission statement: \"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity.\" And this is something that we're very excited about. I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.And you know, when you give to a nonprofit, you might have 50 cents on the dollar. If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one. If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars. And that's huge. And then he turned around and said, \"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one.\" I said, \"Well, that's great.\" So, we have actually \u2014 are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world-class prize institute. This is what happens when you put up a prize, when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials. You get publicity increase, and when it's won, publicity shoots through the roof \u2014 if it's properly managed \u2014 and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor. Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving, you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability. And the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term. That's our value proposition in a prize.If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne, or any kind of a new technology, you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome. It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize, the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee, and you pay on success. Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across \u2014 tried to go across the Atlantic, and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE. So, prizes work great. You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there, you know that when you're going for a goal, the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself. Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule of \u2014 that's a crazy idea, it'll never work. And then you have to convince others, so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds, and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward, and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does, what we've experienced a prize doing, is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things, because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea. Well, it must be a good idea. Someone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.And each of these areas was something that we found the Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation. So, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules, and we're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories. We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology \u2014 and I'll talk about those more in a moment. And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team. We're going after an orbital prize.We are looking at a number of energy prizes. Craig Venter has just joined our board and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him, we'll be announcing later this fall, about \u2014 imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine. And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship. So my final slide here is, the most critical tool for solving humanity's grand challenges \u2014 it isn't technology, it isn't money, it's only one thing \u2014 it's the committed, passionate human mind.(Applause)", "id": 335, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nMy mission in life since I was a kid was,\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nand is, to take the rest of you into space.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.958\nIt's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:25.958\ntake the people of Earth and transition off, permanently.

And we have these huge rocks,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nyou know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nand while the probability is very small,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nthe impact, figured in literally,\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nof one of these hitting the Earth is so huge\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nthat to spend a small fraction looking, searching,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\npreparing to defend, is not unreasonable.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nAnd of course, the third motivator,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\none near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nIn fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nthere's a class of the nickel iron,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nwhich in platinum-group metal markets alone\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nare worth something like 20 trillion dollars,\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nif you can go out and grab one of these rocks.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nMy plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nand then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nBut fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nAnd for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nThis was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nAnd Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nIf you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\non May 25, JFK said, \"We're going to go to the moon.\"\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nAnd people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nto go and be part of this amazing mission.\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAnd we knew nothing about going to space.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nWe went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nto going to the moon in eight years,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nand the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nThey didn't know what couldn't be done.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nThey had to make up everything.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd that, my friend, is amazing motivation.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThis is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.958\n\"If I can go to the moon\" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\n\"nothing, nothing is impossible.\" But of course,\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nwe've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nBut I put forward here, the government is not going to get us there.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThe government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nThe shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThat's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWe shouldn't be happy in standing for that.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nOne of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwas take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAs we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nwe should be allowed to risk.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\njust needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nin fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nThe entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand clearly the industrial-military complex --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nwith Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nThe ability for us to access these resources\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nto gain planetary redundancy --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nwe can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nyou know, everything stored on our databases,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand back them up off the planet,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nin case there would be one of those disastrous situations.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThe difficulty is getting there, and clearly, the cost to orbit is key.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nOnce you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nthe moon, to Mars. And today,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nthere's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nand the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nArguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nOne of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWe've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nto go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nBut that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\n(Laughter) --\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nit is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nYou know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nFor the first time ever, we have enough wealth\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nconcentrated in the hands of few individuals\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand the technology accessible\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nthat will allow us to really drive space exploration.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nBut how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nWe know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nbut how cheap could it get?\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nLet's go back to high school physics here.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nIf you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nto take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nand then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nremember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nIt's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nIf you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nIf you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nand they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nanybody here fast in math?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nHow much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.958\n100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nwe need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nI'll grant you that.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:26.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.958\nBut guys, if history has taught us anything,\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nit's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nI have no question that the physics,\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthe engineering to get us down to the point\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nwhere all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThe difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nToday, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nof their own money in R&amp;D.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nIt's all government research dollars, and very few of those.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:06:59.958\nAnd in fact, the large corporations,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nthe governments, can't take the risk.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nSo we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nToday's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\n12 to 15 launches per year.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nNumber of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nOne per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nand I call them self-loading carbon payloads.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nThey come with their own money. They're easy to make.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nIt's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nreading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nWe offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\ncarry three people up to 100 kilometers,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\ncome back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nTwenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nspending between one to 25 million dollars each.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nAnd of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nwhich made those two flights and won the competition.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nAnd I'd like to take you there, to that morning,\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nfor just a quick video.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\n(Video) Pilot: Release our fire.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nRichard Searfoss: Good luck.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:31.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nRS: We've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nRS: So in my official capacity as the chief judge\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof the Ansari X PRIZE competition,\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nI declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nhas indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nPeter Diamandis: Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwas raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nWe went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nNo one believed it was done. Everyone said, \"Oh, what does NASA think?\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nWell, people are going to die,\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nhow can you possibly going to put this forward?\"\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nI found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nAnd what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nand buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSee, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nand said, \"Are you going to compete?\" No.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.958\n\"Are you going to compete?\" No. \"No one's going to win this thing.\"\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nSo, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nand I took a bet that someone would win.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nSo -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:52.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWe've had a lot of accomplishments\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nand it's been a tremendous success.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nOne of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nis going to hang in Air and Space Museum,\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nnext to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nIsn't that great? (Applause)\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo a little bit about the future, steps to space, what's available for you.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nToday, you can go and experience weightless flights.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nBy '08, suborbital flights, the price tag for that, you know, on Virgin,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nis going to be about 200,000.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nThere are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly,\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nI think, to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight.\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nOrbital flights -- we can take you to the space station.\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nAnd then I truly believe, once a group is in orbit around the Earth --\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nI know if they don't do it, I am --\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwe're going to stockpile some fuel,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nmake a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nQuick moment for the designers in the audience.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nWe spent 11 years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nHere are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nand my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\npeople think a zero gravity room,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthere's a switch on there that turns it off --\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nbut it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd turns out 7-Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nIf we can get the audio up?\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\n(Video) Narrator: For a chance to win the first free ticket to space,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nlook for specially marked packages of Diet 7-Up.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWhen you want the taste that won't weigh you down,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nthe only way to go is up.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nPD: That was filmed inside our airplane, and so, you can now do this.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nWe're based down in Florida.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nLet me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nThe future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nI had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nto actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand we just took on a new mission statement:\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\n\"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nand other technologies for the benefit of humanity.\"\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAnd this is something that we're very excited about.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd you know, when you give to a nonprofit,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nyou might have 50 cents on the dollar.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nIf you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIf you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nAnd that's huge. And then he turned around and said,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n\"Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one.\"\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nI said, \"Well, that's great.\"\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nSo, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\ninto a world-class prize institute.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nThis is what happens when you put up a prize,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nwhen you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nYou get publicity increase, and when it's won,\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\npublicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed --\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nand that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nThen, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nyou get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd the benefit to the sponsors\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nis the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nThat's our value proposition in a prize.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nIf you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nor any kind of a new technology,\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nyou have to fund that from the beginning\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nand maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nIt may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nthe beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nand you pay on success.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nOrteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across --\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\ntried to go across the Atlantic,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nSo, prizes work great.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nYou know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nyou know that when you're going for a goal,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthe first thing you have to do is believe\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nthat you can do it yourself.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThen, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nof -- that's a crazy idea, it'll never work.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nAnd then you have to convince others,\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nso that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nand then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nand institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand you have to deal with failures. What a prize does,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nwhat we've experienced a prize doing,\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nis literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nbecause a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea.\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nWell, it must be a good idea.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nSomeone's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nAnd each of these areas was something that we found\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nthe Ansari X PRIZE helped short-circuit these for innovation.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo, as an organization, we put together a prize discovery process\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nof how to come up with prizes and write the rules,\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nand we're actually looking at creating prizes\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nin a number of different categories.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nWe're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nand I'll talk about those more in a moment.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwithin the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nWe're going after an orbital prize.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nWe are looking at a number of energy prizes.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nCraig Venter has just joined our board\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nwe'll be announcing later this fall,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nabout -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nfor under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nAnd clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nSo my final slide here is, the most critical tool\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nfor solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nit isn't money, it's only one thing --\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nit's the committed, passionate human mind.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What we think we know", "duration": "748", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_drori_on_what_we_think_we_know", "transcript": "I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. I'd like to begin with four questions. This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year. That's an in-joke, by the way. But these four questions, actually, are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard. And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers, of audiences of science educators \u2014 so that's science teachers \u2014 and also of seven-year-olds, and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.So the first question, and you might want to write this down, either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well. A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right? I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair, right? Where does all this stuff come from? (Knocks)And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire? And would you be able to, kind of, draw a \u2014 you don't have to draw the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram, if you had to do it? Or would you just say, that's actually not possible?The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter? I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter, but why? And finally, would you be able to \u2014 and you can sort of scribble it, if you like \u2014 scribble a plan diagram of the solar system, showing the shape of the planets' orbits? Would you be able to do that? And if you can, just scribble a pattern.OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers, as teachers often think, but actually from common sense, from experience of the world around them, from all the things that go on between them and their peers, and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience. And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him, Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right? (Laughter) I'm not quite sure how he died, actually. Was he beheaded in the end, or hung? (Laughter) Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right, and you haven't been conferring, and so on. And I \u2014 you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate, but maybe not in this instance.A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff, 99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air. Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED, will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people, probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards, and say that actually, it comes out of the ground. Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country, filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business. But, actually, we don't do that. The mass of this comes out of the air. Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain. I passed them really well, but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground.Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire? Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that. Now, I have some rather bad news, which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you, which unfortunately \u2014 the sound doesn't work in this room, so I'm going to describe to you, in true \"Monty Python\" fashion, what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away from here, and you wouldn't mind too much, but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them. And so, there's a whole lot of people saying, \"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air. That's very surprising to me.\" And those are science graduates. And we intercut it with, \"We are the premier science university in the world,\" because of British-like hubris. (Laughter) And when we gave graduate engineers that question, they said it couldn't be done. And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb, and said, \"Can you do it?\" They couldn't do it. Right? And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way, it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people \u2014 we might as well get it right. And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation, as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew, is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. That's what plants actually do for a living. And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun: we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice if we don't understand that kind of thing. Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb. It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb, if you've only seen a circuit diagram, you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter? We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot, and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning, and it happens pretty early on. By extension, we think to ourselves, \"Why it's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we're closer to the Sun.\" I promise you that most of you will have got that. Oh, you're all shaking your heads, but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly. Other ones are kind of going like this. All right. It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth. And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't. The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right? It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere, we're further from the Sun in summer, as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system. If you believe, as most of you probably do, that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun, you must have drawn an ellipse. Right? That would explain it, right? Except, in your \u2014 you're nodding \u2014 now, in your ellipse, have you thought, \"Well, what happens during the night?\" Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer and we've got winter, and what \u2014 does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night, and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on, and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right, and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.So, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan. That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right? And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar. I hope you notice the coincidence here. What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception, right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children? What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system, to show that it's not really like that? You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you? It's a plan, looking down from above. But, no, look what I found in the textbooks. That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks, from websites, educational websites \u2014 and almost anything you pick up is like that. And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles, whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle, isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle, if you've got that misconception in your head, then that two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses. So you've \u2014 it's crap, isn't it really? As we say. So, these mental models \u2014 we look for evidence that reinforces our models. We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else, and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look \u2014 and scientists do it, constantly \u2014 we look for evidence that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans. These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed, there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional \u2014 in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in \"Annie Hall,\" and said, \"God, that's so professional.\" And that you don't \u2014 there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right, and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation \u2014 I'll use an example from nearby \u2014 is San Francisco Exploratorium, where all the things that \u2014 the demonstrations, and so on, are made out of everyday objects that children can understand, it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with. And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it, they would have learned how it actually works, rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right? And things that \u2014 where there isn't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium, and it all looks fantastic, OK? And the Exploratorium does that really, really well. And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense, in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.So, children are not empty vessels, OK? So, as \"Monty Python\" would have it, this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so, but this is \u2014 children are not empty vessels. They come with their own ideas and their own theories, and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them, right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates, either. But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology. For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology [for television]. And it's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works, it's quite difficult to shift those. So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood. Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK? Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's \u2014 which is quite humbling, as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after, that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching. And we collude. We design tests, or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right? And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. OK? We collude, and actually if you \u2014 if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams, to really understand, to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue, and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air, then I might have done better at science. So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.Your homework is \u2014 you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift? An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads. And the second question to that then is, ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down. Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right? And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer. So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see. (Laughter) I've always wanted to say that in this country. (Laughter) Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children, and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff, because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know, you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement, it's just part of learning that's important. Thank you very much. Now \u2014 oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.

And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:03.958\nA little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nI think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nright? Where does all this stuff come from?\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:13.958\n(Knocks)\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nAnd your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwith a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nthe diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nif you had to do it? Or would you just say,\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nthat's actually not possible?\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nThe third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nI think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbut why? And finally, would you be able to --\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nand you can sort of scribble it, if you like --\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nscribble a plan diagram of the solar system,\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nshowing the shape of the planets' orbits?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nWould you be able to do that?\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd if you can, just scribble a pattern.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nOK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nas teachers often think, but actually from common sense,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nfrom experience of the world around them,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nfrom all the things that go on between them and their peers,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nAnd one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nCardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nbecause it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nI'm not quite sure how he died, actually.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWas he beheaded in the end, or hung?\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nNow, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nand you haven't been conferring, and so on.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nAnd I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nbut maybe not in this instance.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nA little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:59.958\n99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nNow, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nwill have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nprobably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nand say that actually, it comes out of the ground.\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nNow, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nfilling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nBut, actually, we don't do that.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThe mass of this comes out of the air.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nNow, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nI passed them really well, but I still came out of school\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthinking that that stuff came out of the ground.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nSecond one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nYes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nNow, I have some rather bad news,\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nwhich is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nwhich unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nso I'm going to describe to you, in true \"Monty Python\" fashion,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhat happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\ngo to MIT on graduation day.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nWe chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nfrom here, and you wouldn't mind too much,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nbut it sort of works the same way in Britain\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand in the West Coast of the USA.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nof science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nAnd so, there's a whole lot of people saying,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\n\"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nThat's very surprising to me.\" And those are science graduates.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nAnd we intercut it with, \"We are the premier science university in the world,\"\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nbecause of British-like hubris.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd when we gave graduate engineers that question,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nthey said it couldn't be done.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand said, \"Can you do it?\" They couldn't do it. Right?\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nit's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAs if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nfor teaching people -- we might as well get it right.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd there are also some societal reasons\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nwhy we might want people to understand what it is that's happening\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nin photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nis how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nas I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nis how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThat's what plants actually do for a living.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nwe are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nif we don't understand that kind of thing.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nNow, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nBut if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nif you've only seen a circuit diagram,\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nyou might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nSo, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nWe learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nand it happens pretty early on.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nBy extension, we think to ourselves, \"Why it's hotter in summer than in winter\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nmust be because we're closer to the Sun.\"\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nI promise you that most of you will have got that.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nOh, you're all shaking your heads,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nOther ones are kind of going like this. All right.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nIt's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nare spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nAnd if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nThe Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nIt makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwe're further from the Sun in summer,\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nas it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nOK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nIf you believe, as most of you probably do,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nthat it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nyou must have drawn an ellipse.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nRight? That would explain it, right?\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nExcept, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nhave you thought, \"Well, what happens during the night?\"\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nBetween Australia and here, right, they've got summer\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand we've got winter, and what --\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\ndoes the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nand then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nand we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nSo, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThat's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nI hope you notice the coincidence here.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nWhat would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nright, in their heads, of elliptical orbits\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\ncaused by our experiences as children?\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nWhat sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nto show that it's not really like that?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nYou'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nIt's a plan, looking down from above.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBut, no, look what I found in the textbooks.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nThat's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nfrom websites, educational websites --\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand almost anything you pick up is like that.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nto have a load of concentric circles,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nwhereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nisn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nif you've got that misconception in your head, then that\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:01.958\ntwo-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nSo you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSo, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nWe do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nand scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nthat reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nand willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nSo, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nThese are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nteaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nand the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nAnd, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nthere's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nin that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nfrom under the sheets in that scene in \"Annie Hall,\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nand said, \"God, that's so professional.\" And that you don't --\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthere's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nand, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nI'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.958\nwhere all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nare made out of everyday objects that children can understand,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nit's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nAnd I know that if the graduates at MIT\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nand in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nand the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthey would have learned how it actually works,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nrather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nSo good interpretation is more about\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nthings that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nAnd things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof a piece of glass or machined titanium,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand it all looks fantastic, OK?\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nAnd the Exploratorium does that really, really well.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nin other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo, children are not empty vessels, OK?\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nSo, as \"Monty Python\" would have it,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nthis is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nbut this is -- children are not empty vessels.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nThey come with their own ideas and their own theories,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nand unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nright? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nof how the world and universe operates, either.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nBut this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nFor example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nof the whole population into digital technology [for television].\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.958\nAnd it's one of the difficult things\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nis that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nit's quite difficult to shift those.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nas children persist into adulthood.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nPoor teaching actually does more harm than good.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nIn this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nby children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nSame for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nas a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nthat's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAnd we collude. We design tests,\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nor at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nAnd governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nOK? We collude, and actually if you --\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nif someone had designed a test for me\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nwhen I was doing my biology exams,\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nto really understand, to see whether I'd understood\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nmore than just kind of putting starch and iodine together\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand seeing it go blue,\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nand really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nthen I might have done better at science.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nSo the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nYour homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAn obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd the second question to that then is,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nAh ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nSo, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI've always wanted to say that in this country.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nFinally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nand anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nbecause it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nyou complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nit's just part of learning that's important.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nNow -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:22.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "How humans and animals can live together", "duration": "1426", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_goodall_at_tedglobal_07", "transcript": "Good afternoon, good evening, whatever. We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir, but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening. You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other, from one group of nests to the next.And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday. He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam. And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind through DNA genetic profiling. And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey, who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees. And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then. It's kind of commonplace now, but his argument was \u2014 because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils, from the shape of the muscle attachments, something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them. But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know. And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize. He argued \u2014 and it's now a fairly common theory \u2014 that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today, then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like, human-like ancestor some seven million years ago. And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient, ancient past.Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution, you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees. They are more like us than any other living creature, and we've heard about that during this TED Conference. So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality. Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more, although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild. Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12. Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years, a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing, sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back. And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning. As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals, so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history. And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do. We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see. And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool-using behaviors \u2014 that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa \u2014 how these are passed from one generation to the next, through observation, imitation and practice, so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that. They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures, many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing. They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back. And they swagger and they throw rocks. In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion, precursors to love and true altruism. Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature. They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war. And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part, are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group. They are very territorially aggressive. Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations. The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day. And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild, have helped \u2014 more than anything else \u2014 to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from, the amazing animals with whom we share the planet. So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees, like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats. This is just one photograph from the air, and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe. And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago, and realized that outside the park, this forest, which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies, that a question came to my mind. \"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees, when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?\" More people are living there than the land could possibly support. The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo. And very poor people \u2014 they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.This led to a program, which we call TACARE. It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park. It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24. There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries, methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded, almost desert-like land up in these mountains. Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion. Ways of reclaiming overused farmland, so that within two years they can again be productive. Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells. Perhaps build some schoolrooms. Most important of all, I believe, is working with small groups of women, providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans. And we've got, as is the case around the world, about 95 percent of all loans returned. Empowering women, working with education, providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school, in the clear understanding that, all around the world, as women's education improves, family size drops. We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.And as a result of this program, something's happening for conservation. What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages, instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys \u2014 and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian \u2014 but when we began the TACARE program, it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers, asking what they were interested in. Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not. They were interested in health; they were interested in education. And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve, they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation. They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees, so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. This is an area way outside the National Park, stretching out into all these very degraded lands. And as these villages have a better standard of life, they are actually agreeing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside, so that once again, as the trees grow back, the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact \u2014 as they must for genetic viability \u2014 with other remnant groups outside the National Park. So TACARE is a success. We're replicating it in other parts of Africa, around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure.The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED, are major problems. There is a great deal of poverty. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile, particularly when you cut down trees, and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion, as desperate populations cut down more and more trees, so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families, what's going to happen? Something's got to give. And the other problems \u2014 in not only Africa, but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere \u2014 what are we doing to our planet? You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American, we need three new planets. Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are, arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth, with this extraordinary brain, capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences, and yet we're destroying the only home we have. The indigenous people around the world, before they made a major decision, used to sit around and ask themselves, \"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?\" Today, major decisions \u2014 and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here, but the developed world \u2014 major decisions involving millions of dollars, and millions of people, are often based on, \"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?\" And these decisions affect Africa.As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests, I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation. So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe, talking in the United States, going to Asia. And everywhere there were these terrible problems. And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. The air that we breathe that often poisons us. The earth is poisoning our foods. The water \u2014 water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century \u2014 and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural, industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world, seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience. The mangroves are being cut down; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse. We've talked about the soil erosion. We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses, so called, leading to climate change. Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.All around the world climates are mixed up. And it's the poor people who are affected worse. It's Africa that already is affected. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse. And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease. And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support, who are too poor to buy food, who can't move away because the whole land is degraded. And so you get desertification \u2014 creeping, creeping, creeping \u2014 as the last of the trees are cut down. And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope. We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people. I asked a question. \"Why?\" Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain, the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify, and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term, in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect? And these young people, when I talk to them, basically they were either depressed or apathetic, or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing, \"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it.\"We have compromised their future. I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age, I feel this desperation. And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots, which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world. It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall. See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet, environmental and social. It's a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things. The most important message of Roots and Shoots: every single one of us makes a difference, every single day. We have a choice. Every one of us in this room, we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make. The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well.The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects. It depends on how old they are, and which country, whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects. But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university, with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups. And every group chooses, between them, three different kinds of project to make this a better world, recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other. So one of their projects will be to help their own human community. And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world. One of their projects will be to help animals \u2014 not just wildlife, domestic animals as well. And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share. And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves, in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures, between religions and between us and the natural world. We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are. We not do have more than this one planet.Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing, one or two projects only \u2014 in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world. Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables. They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money, or just using them to feed their families, and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment, because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens. It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers. Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves. Once again, they're useful members of society. We have this program in prisons as well. So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now. But \u2014 oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS. That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots, with older kids talking to younger ones. And unwanted pregnancies and things like that, which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world: \"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things, you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million, at the turn of the century, to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals. Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest. Do you really have hope?\" Well, yes. You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you? And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.And I mean, think of the technologies. And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines. It's one of my hobbyhorses. We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible. And then talking about renewable energy \u2014 desperately important. Do we care about the planet for our children? How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews? Do we care about their future? And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world, we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day. What we buy. What we wear. And choose to make these choices with the question, how will this affect the environment around me? How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up? Or my grandchild, or whatever it is. So the human brain, coupled with the human heart, and we join hands around the world. And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us, and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park. All of these technologies we can use.Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it? You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen. This change, this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future. And the next reason for hope \u2014 nature is amazingly resilient. You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed, with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate. And an example is the TACARE program. I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump \u2014 if you stop hacking them for firewood, which you don't need to because you have wood lots, then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree. And animals, almost on the brink of extinction, can be given a second chance. That's my next book. It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope, and we've heard about this so much in the last two days: this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people, the resilience of the human spirit, So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty, or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it, sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society, and take their part in changing the world.And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring. We could make a very long list, but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment, with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath. Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies, and although people around the world tried their best, was executed. People like this are so inspirational. People like this are the role models we need for young Africans. And we need some environmental role models as well, and I've been hearing some of them today. So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again, with everyone at TED. And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things, especially the Roots and Shoots program.And just a last word on that \u2014 the young woman who's running this entire conference center, I met her today. She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots. She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam. She said it's helped her to do what she's doing. And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people, when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action, to make the world a better place, truly are our hope for tomorrow.

That's what he wanted to know.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nAnd of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nHe argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nthat if we found behavior patterns similar or the same\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nin our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthen maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nhuman-like ancestor some seven million years ago.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nAnd therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nfrom that ancient, ancient past.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nWell, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nyou very often find people speculating about how early humans\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nmay have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThey are more like us than any other living creature,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand we've heard about that during this TED Conference.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nare so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nEvery chimpanzee has his or her own personality.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nOf course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nalthough we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nMr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:17.958\na long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nsleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nAnd we believe that this long period of childhood\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nis important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAs the brain becomes ever more complex\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nduring evolution in different forms of animals,\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nso we find that learning plays an ever more important role\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nin an individual's life history.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWe know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nAnd we believe that it's in this way\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthat the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nhow these are passed from one generation to the next,\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nthrough observation, imitation and practice,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nso that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nChimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nThey do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nmany of which are similar, or even identical, to ours\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nand formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nThey also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd they swagger and they throw rocks.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIn chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nprecursors to love and true altruism.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nUnfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nThey're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nAnd these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nare directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nThey are very territorially aggressive.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nChimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nhave helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbetween humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nIt's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nas we make even more observations.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nThe study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nhave helped -- more than anything else --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:40.958\nto make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nthe amazing animals with whom we share the planet.\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nSo it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nlike so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nThis is just one photograph from the air,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nand it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nAnd it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nand realized that outside the park, this forest,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nwhich in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nalong the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nwhich is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nthat a question came to my mind.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:24.958\n\"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nwhen the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?\"\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nMore people are living there than the land could possibly support.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThe numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nand over the lake from Congo.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nAnd very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nThis led to a program, which we call TACARE.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIt's a very holistic way of improving the lives\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nof the people living in the villages around the park.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nIt started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nThere isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nmethods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nalmost desert-like land up in these mountains.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nWays of controlling, preventing soil erosion.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nWays of reclaiming overused farmland,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nso that within two years they can again be productive.\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nWorking to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nPerhaps build some schoolrooms.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nMost important of all, I believe,\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nis working with small groups of women,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nproviding them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd we've got, as is the case around the world,\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nabout 95 percent of all loans returned.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nEmpowering women, working with education,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nproviding scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nin the clear understanding that, all around the world,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nas women's education improves, family size drops.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWe provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd as a result of this program,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nsomething's happening for conservation.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nWhat's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.958\ninstead of looking on us as a bunch of white people\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\ncoming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nand by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nbut when we began the TACARE program,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nit was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIt was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nasking what they were interested in.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWere they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nThey were interested in health; they were interested in education.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nAnd as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nthey began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nThey began to understand\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nthat as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nso you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nToday, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nThis is an area way outside the National Park,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nstretching out into all these very degraded lands.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nAnd as these villages have a better standard of life,\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nthey are actually agreeing to put\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nbetween 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nso that once again, as the trees grow back,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nthe chimpanzees will have leafy corridors\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nthrough which they can travel to interact --\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nas they must for genetic viability --\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nwith other remnant groups outside the National Park.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo TACARE is a success.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nWe're replicating it in other parts of Africa,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\naround other wilderness areas\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nwhich are faced with extreme population pressure.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nThe problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor the whole of these first couple of days of TED,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nare major problems.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.958\nThere is a great deal of poverty.\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd when you get large numbers of people\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nliving in land that is not that fertile,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nparticularly when you cut down trees,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nand you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nas desperate populations cut down more and more trees,\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nso that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nwhat's going to happen? Something's got to give.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nAnd the other problems -- in not only Africa,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nbut the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nwhat are we doing to our planet?\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nYou know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nsaid that if every person on this planet\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nattains the standard of living of the average European or American,\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nwe need three new planets.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nToday, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nAnd what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:24.958\narguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nwith this extraordinary brain,\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.958\ncapable of the kind of technology\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nthat is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand yet we're destroying the only home we have.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe indigenous people around the world,\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nbefore they made a major decision,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nused to sit around and ask themselves,\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\n\"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nToday, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nbut the developed world --\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nmajor decisions involving millions of dollars,\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand millions of people, are often based on,\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\n\"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?\"\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd these decisions affect Africa.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAs I began traveling around Africa\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:13.958\ntalking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nI realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\ncould be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\ntalking in the United States, going to Asia.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nAnd everywhere there were these terrible problems.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nAnd you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nThe air that we breathe that often poisons us.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nThe earth is poisoning our foods.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nThe water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nthat we're going to face in this century --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nand everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nindustrial and household chemicals\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nthat still are being sprayed around the world,\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nseemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nThe mangroves are being cut down;\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nthe effects of things like the tsunami get worse.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nWe've talked about the soil erosion.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nWe have the reckless burning of fossil fuels\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nalong with other greenhouse gasses, so called,\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nleading to climate change.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nFinally, all around the world, people have begun to believe\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat there is something going on very wrong with our climate.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nAll around the world climates are mixed up.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd it's the poor people who are affected worse.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nIt's Africa that already is affected.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nIn many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nAnd when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nand added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nAnd the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nwho are too poor to buy food,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nwho can't move away because the whole land is degraded.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nAnd so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nas the last of the trees are cut down.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nAnd this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nSo it wasn't surprising to me\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthat as I was traveling around the world\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nI met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWe seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nI asked a question. \"Why?\"\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nWell, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbetween this extraordinarily clever brain,\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nthe kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nand the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nin terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nAnd these young people, when I talk to them,\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nbasically they were either depressed or apathetic,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nor bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\n\"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nand there's nothing we can do about it.\"\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWe have compromised their future.\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nI've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nI feel this desperation.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nAnd that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwhich began right here in Tanzania\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nand has now spread to 97 countries around the world.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nIt's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nShoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nSee the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nenvironmental and social. It's a message of hope.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nHundreds and thousands of young people around the world\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:54.958\ncan break through and can make this a better world for all living things.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nThe most important message of Roots and Shoots:\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nevery single one of us makes a difference, every single day.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nWe have a choice. Every one of us in this room,\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nwe have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nThe very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nso that the poor have choice as well.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThe Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nIt depends on how old they are, and which country,\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nwhether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nBut basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nwith more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nAnd every group chooses, between them,\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nthree different kinds of project to make this a better world,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nrecognizing that all these different problems are interconnected\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nand impinge on each other.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nSo one of their projects will be to help their own human community.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nin other parts of the world.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nOne of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\ndomestic animals as well.\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nAnd one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nAnd woven throughout all of this is a message\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nof learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.958\nin our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,\n\n00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nbetween religions and between us and the natural world.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nWe need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nWe not do have more than this one planet.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nJust picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nthat the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.958\none or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nSouth Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nand other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nOf course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nThey're working in the refugee camps, with chickens\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nand selling the eggs for a little amount of money,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nor just using them to feed their families,\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nand feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nbecause they're no longer helpless and depending on others\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nwith their vegetables and their chickens.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.958\nIt's being used in Uganda\n\n00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nto give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nDoing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nOnce again, they're useful members of society.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nWe have this program in prisons as well.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nSo, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nBut -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nThat's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nwith older kids talking to younger ones.\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nAnd unwanted pregnancies and things like that,\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nwhich young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nHope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\n\"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nyou've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nfrom about one million, at the turn of the century,\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:13.958\nto no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.\n\n00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nForests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nDo you really have hope?\" Well, yes.\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nYou can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nAnd of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nAnd I mean, think of the technologies.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nAnd I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nIt's one of my hobbyhorses.\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:44.958\nWe just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.\n\n00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:49.958\nAnd then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nDo we care about the planet for our children?\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.958\nHow many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?\n\n00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.958\nDo we care about their future?\n\n00:19:58.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nAnd if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:07.958\nwe can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.\n\n00:20:07.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nWhat we buy. What we wear.\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:14.958\nAnd choose to make these choices with the question,\n\n00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nhow will this affect the environment around me?\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nHow will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nOr my grandchild, or whatever it is.\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:29.958\nSo the human brain, coupled with the human heart,\n\n00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.958\nand we join hands around the world.\n\n00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:35.958\nAnd that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,\n\n00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nand Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.958\nAll of these technologies we can use.\n\n00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nNow let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nYou've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:51.958\nThis change, this change. To see change\n\n00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:54.958\nthat we must have if we care about the future.\n\n00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:58.958\nAnd the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.\n\n00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nYou can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.958\nwith time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.\n\n00:21:04.958 --> 00:21:07.958\nAnd an example is the TACARE program.\n\n00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.958\nI told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --\n\n00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nif you stop hacking them for firewood,\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:14.958\nwhich you don't need to because you have wood lots,\n\n00:21:14.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nthen in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:21.958\nAnd animals, almost on the brink of extinction,\n\n00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.958\ncan be given a second chance. That's my next book.\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nIt's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:31.958\nand we've heard about this so much in the last two days:\n\n00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:35.958\nthis indomitable human spirit.

Now, there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that, is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack, eliminating the threat altogether. And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry, until this very moment, we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases, which I'm going to go through with you right now.First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945. The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project, and the idea was very straightforward: we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. And in 1945, we were the only nuclear power. We had a few nuclear weapons, two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima, a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945, killing about 250,000 people between those two.And for a few years, we were the only nuclear power on Earth. But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power, and they began to match what the United States had developed. And from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s. So by 1985 \u2014 each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads \u2014 the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads, and seven members of something that came to be known as the \"nuclear club.\"And it was an extraordinary time, and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we \u2014 that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing. But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 \u2014 going forward, of course \u2014 were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union, we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter-proliferate, and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000. It's a very difficult number to deal with, because what we've done is we've quote unquote \"decommissioned\" some of the warheads. They're still probably usable. They could be \"re-commissioned,\" but the way they count things, which is very complicated, we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. But we also, in that period of time, added two more members to the nuclear club: Pakistan and North Korea.So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world, but a very different set of circumstances. So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters. Chapter one is 1949 to 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up, and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years, was a superpowers' nuclear arms race. It was characterized by a nation-versus-nation, very fragile standoff. And basically, we lived for all those years, and some might argue that we still do, in a situation of being on the brink, literally, of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity. It's incredible that we actually lived through all that.We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym, which is MAD. It stands for mutually assured destruction. So it meant if you attacked us, we would attack you virtually simultaneously, and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. So the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived. And the danger of that, of course, is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter-launch, even though the first country had not actually launched anything. During this chapter one, there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe, and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it. So this was chapter one.Now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration, we engaged in America in a series \u2014 and in fact, in the Soviet Union \u2014 in a series of response planning. It was absolutely incredible. So premise one is we'd be destroying the world, and then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it? So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things, just to jog your memories. If you're born after 1950, this is just \u2014 consider this entertainment, otherwise it's memory lane.This was Bert the Turtle. (Video) This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war, then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. That was the principle. You \u2014 there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us, and if you get under your desk, things would be OK.(Laughter)I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested, and I think this was seriously delusional.(Laughter)Secondly, we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war, or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out, a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And actually \u2014 so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters. Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground. Now, the bomb shelters at that point \u2014 let's say you bought a prefab one \u2014 it would be a few hundred dollars, maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one. Yet, what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house? What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent of the population, as far as anyone knows, did anything, either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter. Many buildings, public buildings, around the country \u2014 this is New York City \u2014 had these little civil defense signs, and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry. And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know, and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. Here is their first big public announcement. They would propose \u2014 actually there were about six volumes written on this \u2014 a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the United States having three to four days warning that the Soviets were going to attack us. So the goal was to evacuate the target cities. We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside.And I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate, and actually have three or four days' warning. It was just completely off the wall. Turns out that they had another idea behind it, even though this was \u2014 they were telling the public it was to save us. The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons \u2014 very expensive \u2014 and potentially double their arsenal, to not only take out the original site, but take out sites where people were going. This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this. It was just really, really frightening.The main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality. The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war. So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility, around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly. They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city, and they'd say, \"Here's a map of your city. Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.\" So no possibility of medical response to, or meaningful preparedness for all-out nuclear war. So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. This disconnect was never actually resolved. And what happened was \u2014 when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era, which started back in 1945.Chapter two starts in 1991. When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part. It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that. But from 1991 through the present time, emphasized by the attacks of 2001, the idea of an all-out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event, act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. Although the scenario has changed very considerably, the fact is that we haven't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means. So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. So, what is a nuclear terror threat? And there's four key ingredients to describing that.First thing is that the global nuclear weapons, in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps, happen to be not uniformly secure. And it's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia. There are many, many sites where warheads are stored and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials, like highly enriched uranium and plutonium, are absolutely not safe. They're available to be bought, stolen, whatever. They're acquirable, let me put it that way. From 1993 through 2006, the International Atomic Energy Agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft, 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium, the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300, at the low end, to about 2,100 metric tons. More than 100 megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities. How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb? Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.So, what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium. This is not a product placement. It's just \u2014 in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I'd be pretty distressed about this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 but basically, this is it.This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile that's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima. Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. That \u2014 you'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium. Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds: this. This is enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon. Now this situation, already I \u2014 you know, I don't really like thinking about this, although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very, very insecure in terms of developing this material. The second thing is, what about the know-how?And there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon. Well, there's a lot of know-how out there. There's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there. There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb. There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it. All of this information is relatively available. If you have an undergraduate degree in physics, I would suggest \u2014 although I don't, so maybe it's not even true \u2014 but something close to that would allow you, with the information that's currently available, to actually build a nuclear weapon.The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that, who would actually do such a thing? Well, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. They are very dedicated and committed. They are stateless. Somebody once said, Al Qaeda does not have a return address, so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon, what's the response, and to whom is the response? And they're retaliation-proof. Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference, since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us, it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work.Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden. He wrote many, many times statements to this effect: \"we have the right to kill four million Americans, two million of whom should be children.\" And we don't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm, for whatever their reasons. McVeigh and Nichols, and the Oklahoma City attack in the 1990s was a good example of homegrown terrorists. What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon? The fourth element is that the high-value U.S. targets are accessible, soft and plentiful.This would be a talk for another day, but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate. What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected \u2014 five to seven percent.This is Alexander Lebed, who was a general that worked with Yeltsin, who talked about, and presented to Congress, this idea that the Russians had developed \u2014 these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield \u2014 0.1 to one kiloton, Hiroshima was around 13 kilotons \u2014 but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many, many \u2014 more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable. And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. You put the elements into a suitcase. It becomes very portable. The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car. You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.You don't want to build a suitcase bomb, and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. This is the size of the \"Little Boy\" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima. It was 9.8 feet long, weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so, you rent a truck that's got the right capacity, and you take your bomb, you put it in the truck and you're ready to go. It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive? You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability, but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening. Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves.I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community \u2014 a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable, unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk, like better interdiction, better prevention, better fixing, you know, better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. At this particular moment, we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. I don't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon, although even that is not completely off the table. There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many, many times over. There are flash points in India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, in North Korea, other places where the use of nuclear weapons, while initially locally, could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all-out nuclear war. It's very unsettling.Here we go. OK. I'm back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. We're coming down, and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here, in the Financial District. This is a 10-kiloton bomb, slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think \u2014 \"news you could use\" kind of concept here. So, first of all, this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine. This is the ultimate. And if you're in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off, you have a 90 percent chance of not making it. If you're right where the bomb went off, you will be vaporized. And that's \u2014 I'm just telling you, this is not good.(Laughter)You assume that. Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance of being killed, and up to about eight miles away \u2014 now I'm talking about killed instantly \u2014 somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of getting killed. The thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is \u2014 first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit at the core here, where it goes off, and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat, acute radiation and blast effects. An enormous hurricane-like wind, and destruction of buildings almost totally, within this yellow circle here. And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here, is that, what happens to you if you're in here? Well, if we're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack, you, up here, are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast. You have, when the blast goes off \u2014 and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.(Laughter)If you look at it, you're going to be blind, either temporarily or permanently. So if there's any way that you can avoid, like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing. If you find yourself alive, but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have \u2014 that's gone off \u2014 you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and exactly where it went off, to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do \u2014 and I mean this seriously \u2014 is go about a mile away from the blast. And what happens is \u2014 this is \u2014 I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes, it comes straight down. Within 24 hours, lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds, and it's mostly in this particular direction \u2014 it's going northeast.And if you're in this vicinity, you've got to get away. So you're feeling the wind \u2014 and there's tremendous wind now that you're going to be feeling \u2014 and you want to go perpendicular to the wind [not upwind or downwind]. if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you. You've got to get out of there. If you don't get out of there, you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order. If you can't get out of there, we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. Now, in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible, or you have to be on a floor \u2014 on a high floor \u2014 if it's a ground burst explosion, which it would be, higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher, or in the basement. But basically, you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. And if you do that, you actually can survive a nuclear blast.Over the next few days to a week, there will be a radiation cloud, again, going with the wind, and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out \u2014 in this case, over Long Island. And if you're in the direct fallout zone here, you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there, and that's clear. But if you are sheltered, you can actually survive. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally, and not knowing information, can save your life, and it could mean the difference between 150,000 to 200,000 fatalities from something like this and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.So, response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential. But in 2008, there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves, personally, are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed. You say \"nuclear\" to them, and they're thinking, \"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile.\" And we're trying to tell them, \"It's not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.\"So the goal here is to minimize fatalities. And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way. That's basically all we're going to be talking about here. And the farther you are away in distance, the longer it is in time from the initial blast; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere, the better. So separation \u2014 hopefully with dirt or concrete, or being in a basement \u2014 distance and time is what will save you.So here's what you do. First of all, as I said, don't stare at the light flash, if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that. But let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that. You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures. If you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover, like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle. And you want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects, if that's at all possible. You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud, I said, in just a few minutes. And shelter and place. You want to move [only] crosswind for 1.2 miles.You know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction, less destroyed here, then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way, as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. Once you're out and evacuating, you want to keep as much of your skin, your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there. And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible. And if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing, you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be \u2014 the radioactive material that might be on you. And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum, but you're going to wait hopefully \u2014 you'll have your little wind-up, battery-less radio, and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.In conclusion, nuclear war is less likely than before, but by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable. Nuclear terrorism is possible \u2014 it may be probable \u2014 but is survivable. And this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes of the U.S. public health community. And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything, whether it's war or terrorism, is abolition of nuclear weapons. And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming, I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable, inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world.Now, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I don't want to be indelicate, but this \u2014 he's no longer in office. We don't really care, OK. This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures, but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. We've not been focused, we've not done what we had to do, and now we're facing the potential of bad, hell on Earth.

They could be \"re-commissioned,\"\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nbut the way they count things, which is very complicated,\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nwe think we have about a third\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nof the nuclear weapons we had before.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nBut we also, in that period of time,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nadded two more members to the nuclear club:\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nPakistan and North Korea.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nSo we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.958\namong many countries around the world,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nbut a very different set of circumstances.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo I'm going to talk about\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\na nuclear threat story in two chapters.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nChapter one is 1949 to 1991,\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nwhen the Soviet Union broke up,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nwas a superpowers' nuclear arms race.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nIt was characterized by\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\na nation-versus-nation,\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nvery fragile standoff.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nAnd basically,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nwe lived for all those years,\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nand some might argue that we still do,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nin a situation of\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nbeing on the brink, literally,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nof an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nIt's incredible that we actually lived through all that.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nWe were totally dependent during those years\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\non this amazing acronym, which is MAD.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nIt stands for mutually assured destruction.\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nSo it meant\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nif you attacked us, we would attack you\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nvirtually simultaneously,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand the end result would be a destruction\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nof your country and mine.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nSo the threat of my own destruction\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nkept me from launching\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:18.958\na nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd the danger of that, of course, is that\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\na misreading of a radar screen\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\ncould actually cause a counter-launch,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\neven though the first country had not actually launched anything.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nDuring this chapter one,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthere was a high level of public awareness\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nabout the potential of nuclear catastrophe,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand an indelible image was implanted\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nin our collective minds\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nthat, in fact, a nuclear holocaust\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nwould be absolutely globally destructive\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nand could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nSo this was chapter one.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nNow the odd thing is that even though\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nwe knew that there would be\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nthat kind of civilization obliteration,\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nwe engaged in America in a series --\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nand in fact, in the Soviet Union --\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nin a series of response planning.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nIt was absolutely incredible.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nSo premise one is we'd be destroying the world,\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nand then premise two is, why don't we get prepared for it?\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nSo what\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nwe offered ourselves\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nwas a collection of things.

(Video)\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThis was basically an attempt\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto teach our schoolchildren\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nthat if we did get engaged\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nin a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nthen we wanted our school children\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nto kind of basically duck and cover.\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nThat was the principle. You --\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nthere would be a nuclear conflagration\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nabout to hit us, and if you get under your desk,\n\n00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nthings would be OK.\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nI didn't do all that well\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nin psychiatry in medical school, but I was interested,\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nand I think this was seriously delusional.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nSecondly, we told people\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nto go down in their basements\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nand build a fallout shelter.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nMaybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nor you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\na very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nOr you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nthat you could simply bury in the ground.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nNow, the bomb shelters at that point --\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nlet's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars,\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nmaybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nYet, what percentage of Americans\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\ndo you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nWhat percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nLess than two percent. About 1.4 percent\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nof the population, as far as anyone knows,\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:56.958\ndid anything,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\neither making a space in their basement\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nor actually building a bomb shelter.\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nMany buildings, public buildings, around the country --\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nthis is New York City -- had these little civil defense signs,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand the idea was that you would\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nrun into one of these shelters and be safe\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nfrom the nuclear weaponry.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nAnd one of the greatest governmental delusions\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nof all time was something that happened\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nin the early days of\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nHere is their first big public\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nannouncement.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThey would propose --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nactually there were about six volumes written on this --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\na crisis relocation plan\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nthat was dependent upon\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nthe United States having three to four days warning\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nthat the Soviets were going to attack us.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nSo the goal was to evacuate the target cities.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nWe would move people out of the target cities\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\ninto the countryside.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd I'm telling you, I actually testified at the Senate\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nabout the absolute ludicrous idea\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nthat we would actually evacuate,\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nand actually have three or four days' warning.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIt was just completely off the wall.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nTurns out that they had another idea\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nbehind it, even though this was --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nthey were telling the public it was to save us.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nThe idea was that we would force the Soviets\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nto re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive --\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand potentially double their arsenal,\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nto not only take out the original site,\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nbut take out sites where people were going.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nThis was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIt was just really, really frightening.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThe main point here is we were dealing with\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.958\na complete disconnect from reality.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThe civil defense programs were disconnected\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nfrom the reality of what we'd see in all-out nuclear war.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nSo organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\naround 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThey would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nand they'd say, \"Here's a map of your city.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nHere's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.\"\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nSo no possibility of medical response to,\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nor meaningful preparedness for\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nall-out nuclear war.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nSo we had to prevent nuclear war\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nif we expected to survive.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nThis disconnect was never actually resolved.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nAnd what happened was --\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nwhen we get in to chapter two\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nof the nuclear threat era,\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwhich started back in 1945.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nChapter two starts in 1991.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nWhen the Soviet Union broke up,\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nwe effectively lost that adversary\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nas a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIt's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBut from 1991\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nthrough the present time,\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.958\nemphasized by the attacks of 2001,\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nthe idea of an all-out nuclear war\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nhas diminished and the idea of a single event,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nact of nuclear terrorism\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nis what we have instead.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nAlthough the scenario has changed\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nvery considerably, the fact is\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nthat we haven't changed our mental image\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nof what a nuclear war means.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nSo I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nSo, what is a nuclear terror threat?\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nAnd there's four key ingredients to describing that.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nFirst thing is that the global nuclear weapons,\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nin the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nhappen to be not uniformly secure.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nAnd it's particularly not secure\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nin the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThere are many, many sites where warheads are stored\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nlike highly enriched uranium and plutonium,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nare absolutely not safe.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nThey're available to be bought, stolen, whatever.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nThey're acquirable, let me put it that way.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nFrom 1993 through 2006,\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\ndocumented 175 cases of nuclear theft,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:38.958\n18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nthe key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nThe global stockpile of highly enriched uranium\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nis about 1,300, at the low end,\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nto about 2,100 metric tons.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nMore than 100 megatons of this\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nis stored in particularly insecure\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nRussian facilities.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nHow much of that do you think it would take\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nto actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWell, you need about 75 pounds of it.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nSo, what I'd like to show you\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nis\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nwhat it would take to hold 75 pounds\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nof highly enriched uranium.\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nThis is not a product placement.

This is enough plutonium\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nto create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nNow this situation, already I --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nyou know, I don't really like thinking about this,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nalthough somehow I got myself a job\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nwhere I have to think about it. So\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nthe point is that we're very, very insecure\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nin terms of developing this material.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nThe second thing is, what about the know-how?\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nAnd there's a lot of controversy about\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nwhether terror organizations have the know-how\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nto actually make a nuclear weapon.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nWell, there's a lot of know-how out there.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThere's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThere's detailed information on how to assemble\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\na nuclear weapon from parts.\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nThere's books about how to build a nuclear bomb.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nThere are plans for how to create a terror farm\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nwhere you could actually manufacture and develop\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nall the components and assemble it.\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nAll of this information is

I don't, so maybe it's not even true --\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nbut something close to that would allow you,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nwith the information that's currently available,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nto actually build a nuclear weapon.\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nThe third element of the nuclear terror threat\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nis that, who would actually do such a thing?\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nWell, what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nthat involves individuals who are highly organized.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nThey are very dedicated and committed.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nThey are stateless.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nSomebody once said,

response, and to whom is the response?\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nAnd they're retaliation-proof.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nSince there is no real retribution possible\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nthat would make any difference,\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nsince there are people willing to actually give up their lives\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nin order to do a lot of damage to us,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nit becomes apparent\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat the whole notion\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nof this mutually assured

But if you are sheltered,\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nyou can actually survive.\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.958\nThe difference between knowing information\n\n00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.958\nof what you're going to do personally,\n\n00:21:24.958 --> 00:21:26.958\nand not knowing information, can save your life,\n\n00:21:26.958 --> 00:21:28.958\nand it could mean the difference between\n\n00:21:28.958 --> 00:21:30.958\n150,000 to 200,000 fatalities\n\n00:21:30.958 --> 00:21:33.958\nfrom something like this\n\n00:21:33.958 --> 00:21:36.958\nand half a million to 700,000 fatalities.\n\n00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:39.958\nSo, response planning in the twenty-first century\n\n00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:41.958\nis both possible and is essential.\n\n00:21:41.958 --> 00:21:45.958\nBut in 2008, there isn't one single American city\n\n00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:47.958\nthat has done effective plans\n\n00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.958\nto deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.\n\n00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:52.958\nPart of the problem is that\n\n00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.958\nthe emergency planners themselves, personally,\n\n00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:56.958\nare overwhelmed psychologically by the thought\n\n00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.958\nof nuclear catastrophe.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:00.958\nThey are paralyzed.\n\n00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.958\nYou say \"nuclear\" to them, and they're thinking,\n\n00:22:02.958 --> 00:22:05.958\n\"Oh my God, we're all gone. What's the point? It's futile.\"\n\n00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:07.958\nAnd we're trying to tell them, \"It's not futile.\n\n00:22:07.958 --> 00:22:09.958\nWe can change the survival rates\n\n00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:12.958\nby doing some commonsensical things.\"\n\n00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:15.958\nSo the goal here is to minimize fatalities.\n\n00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:17.958\nAnd I just want to leave you with the personal points\n\n00:22:17.958 --> 00:22:19.958\nthat I think you might be interested in.\n\n00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:21.958\nThe key to surviving a nuclear blast\n\n00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:23.958\nis getting out,\n\n00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:26.958\nand not going into harm's way.\n\n00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:28.958\nThat's basically all we're going to be talking about here.\n\n00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:31.958\nAnd the farther you are away in distance,\n\n00:22:31.958 --> 00:22:33.958\nthe longer it is in time\n\n00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.958\nfrom the initial blast;\n\n00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:37.958\nand the more separation between you\n\n00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.958\nand the outside atmosphere, the better.\n\n00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:42.958\nSo separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete,\n\n00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:44.958\nor being in a basement --\n\n00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:46.958\ndistance and time is what will save you.\n\n00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:48.958\nSo here's what you do. First of all,\n\n00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:50.958\nas I said, don't stare at the light flash,\n\n00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:52.958\nif you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that.\n\n00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:54.958\nBut let's assume, theoretically, you want to do that.\n\n00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.958\nYou want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums\n\n00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.958\ndon't burst from the pressures.\n\n00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:02.958\nIf you're very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,\n\n00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:04.958\nlike Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.\n\n00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.958\nAnd you want to get under something so that you're not injured\n\n00:23:07.958 --> 00:23:09.958\nor killed by objects, if that's at all possible.\n\n00:23:09.958 --> 00:23:11.958\nYou want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,\n\n00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:13.958\nI said, in just a few minutes.\n\n00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:16.958\nAnd shelter and place. You want to move [only]\n\n00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.958\ncrosswind for 1.2 miles.\n\n00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:21.958\nYou know, if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed\n\n00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:23.958\nand down in that direction,\n\n00:23:23.958 --> 00:23:25.958\nless destroyed here,\n\n00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:27.958\nthen you know that it was over there, the blast, and you're going this way,\n\n00:23:27.958 --> 00:23:31.958\nas long as you're going crosswise to the wind.\n\n00:23:31.958 --> 00:23:33.958\nOnce you're out and evacuating,\n\n00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:34.958\nyou want to keep as much of your skin,\n\n00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:37.958\nyour mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering\n\n00:23:37.958 --> 00:23:40.958\ndoesn't impede you moving and getting out of there.\n\n00:23:40.958 --> 00:23:43.958\nAnd finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.\n\n00:23:43.958 --> 00:23:45.958\nAnd if you're wearing clothing, you've taken off your clothing,\n\n00:23:45.958 --> 00:23:47.958\nyou're going to get showered down some place\n\n00:23:47.958 --> 00:23:49.958\nand remove the radiation that would be --\n\n00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:52.958\nthe radioactive material that might be on you.\n\n00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:56.958\nAnd then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,\n\n00:23:56.958 --> 00:23:58.958\nbut you're going to wait hopefully -- you'll have your little wind-up,\n\n00:23:58.958 --> 00:24:00.958\nbattery-less radio,\n\n00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:02.958\nand you'll be waiting for people to tell you\n\n00:24:02.958 --> 00:24:04.958\nwhen it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do.\n\n00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:06.958\nIn conclusion,\n\n00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:08.958\nnuclear war is less likely than before,\n\n00:24:08.958 --> 00:24:11.958\nbut by no means out of the question, and it's not survivable.\n\n00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:14.958\nNuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable --\n\n00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.958\nbut is survivable.\n\n00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.958\nAnd this is Jack Geiger, who's one of the heroes\n\n00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:21.958\nof the U.S. public health community.\n\n00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:23.958\nAnd Jack said the only way to deal\n\n00:24:23.958 --> 00:24:25.958\nwith nuclear anything,\n\n00:24:25.958 --> 00:24:27.958\nwhether it's war or terrorism,\n\n00:24:27.958 --> 00:24:29.958\nis abolition of nuclear weapons.\n\n00:24:29.958 --> 00:24:32.958\nAnd you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming,\n\n00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:34.958\nI urge you to think about the fact that\n\n00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:36.958\nwe have to do something about this\n\n00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.958\nunacceptable, inhumane\n\n00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:40.958\nreality of nuclear weapons\n\n00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:42.958\nin our world.\n\n00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:44.958\nNow, this is my favorite civil defense slide, and I --\n\n00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:48.958\n-- I don't want to be indelicate, but\n\n00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:50.958\nthis --\n\n00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:53.958\nhe's no longer in office.

If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve. They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is, a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can. I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone. One is what's on the Boston Public Library. Carved above their door is, \"Free to All.\" It's kind of an inspiring statement, and I'll go back at the end of this. I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it. And the idea of using technology is perfect for us. I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks. It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians, they were able to build the Library of Alexandria \u2014 the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world. The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it. On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened. I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something. And I'm going to try to argue only one point today: that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp. So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking, yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published, everything that was ever meant for distribution, available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed, and that's still being refigured out. But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand, so we can actually achieve that. But I'm going to go over the technological, social and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision. And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website, the books, music, video and just go step \u2014 media type by media type, just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we? Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it? If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it? Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes. It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world. And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte, so \u2014 you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word. So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes \u2014 it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes. 26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big, on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars. So for the cost of a house \u2014 or around here, a garage \u2014 you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress. That's pretty neat.Then the question is, what do you get? You know, is it worth trying to get there? Do you actually want it online? Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun. And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways. And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop. There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways, and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute \u2014 still very book-like \u2014 on your laptop. But I don't know, reading things on a laptop \u2014 whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work. I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great. I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle. It's starting to be a little bit more specified. But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. I like the physical book. And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things, put them on the Net, and then download, print them and bind them, and end up with books again.And we sort of said, well, how hard is this? And it turns out to not be very hard. We actually went off to make a bookmobile. And a bookmobile \u2014 the size of a van with a satellite dish, a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books. It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book. And they actually come out kind of nice looking. You can actually get really good-looking books for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.So the idea of \u2014 this technology actually may end up putting books back in people's hands again. There are some other bookmobiles running around. This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond \u2014 Thoreau's works. This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services, for competing with the bookstore there. In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around. And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria, the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt. It was quite popularly attended. And kids starting to make their own books, and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned. So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro, but I think it still has its place. And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian sort of world, we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda, we might have something. So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out. And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley, fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted, and get a program going making books in rural Uganda. And it actually \u2014 so technologically, it works.What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized, but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized. Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China. And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment. There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well. One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine. We have one of these things now. It's completely cool. It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book. And it's called the \"Espresso Book Machine,\" and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain, beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand, is some of these new little screens that are coming out. And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop. And I don't mean to steal any thunder here, but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader. So here's one of the beta units and you can \u2014 it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader. And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it, and it turns out that 200 dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good. At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer. We're in good enough shape. You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about. But how do you go about doing all this scanning? So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing. And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation \u2014 sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books. Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books. So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India. And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India. The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books. If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better, especially if they're valuable books. If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them, because you could just buy another one, that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning. But do things that you love. But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books \u2014 about 300,000 now \u2014 doing very well. The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.But we sent \u2014 thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library. How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford? And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page. If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up, make it so that you could download, print and bind it \u2014 the whole shebang \u2014 we would have achieved something. So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents? And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well \u2014 sort of these auto-page-turning things. If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages. But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there. So anyway \u2014 so we ended up making our own book scanner, and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras, controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book, you can go and get the proper intonation. So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job. This is not a fax, this is \u2014 the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries. And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume. This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto. And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage. People seem to love it. Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. (Laughter) And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about, in languages that you can read. We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page. So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book. The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing \u2014 26 million books \u2014 is about 750 million dollars, right? But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start, and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.And what we've been able to do is get into libraries. We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries, and libraries are up for having their books scanned. The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA, which is where we have one these scanning centers, and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous. So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility. The thing we're missing is the 10 cents. If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows. We've scanned about 200,000 books. Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month, and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.So all in all, that's going very well. And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world. So I think of \u2014 we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff, and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world. And I think we'll meet in the middle some place, and have the classic thing that you have, which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel. And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them. Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure. But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program, to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over. So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale. We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online. So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month and we've got about 250,000 books online, counting all the other projects that are starting to add in. So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp. The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal. Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions, but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online. And then, there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people. But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise, at least for the out of print and out of copyright, we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these. So how much is there? Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks having been published \u2014 so 78s, long-playing records and CDs \u2014 or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at. It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online, if you're doing things in volume. But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny. This is a fairly heavily litigated area, so we've found that there are niches in the music world that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system. And we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net. In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right? If you give something to a charity or to the public, you get a pat on the back and a tax donation \u2014 except on the Net, where you can go broke. If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed, you can lose your guitars or your house.This doesn't make any sense. So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free, to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library. And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers. The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing, as long as nobody made any money. You could \u2014 concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings, but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead. And we get about two or three bands a day signing up. They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day. We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did, up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material. So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny. We've got a lot of collections now \u2014 a couple hundred thousand items \u2014 and it's growing over time.Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases, there are not that many of them. As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. But half of those were Indian. But anyway, it's doable, but we've only found about a thousand of these things that \u2014 to be out of copyright. So we've digitized those and made those available. But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day \u2014 archival films. We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films, all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home. So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular. We're not quite a YouTube. We tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies, which has just been great fun.Television comes quite a bit larger. We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day. It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television \u2014 Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC \u2014 24 hours a day. We only put one week up, which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11, sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see? CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets. Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out. How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past? And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable, except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job. So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp. So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour, we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the Net. And we've got, now, a lot of these materials. So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there. So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it. Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections. But we've worked through some of those, but we've still got real problems in Washington.Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web. We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996. We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months. And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet, which donates this collection to the Internet Archive. And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource. And we've made a Wayback Machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were. If you go and search on something \u2014 this is Google.com, the different versions of it that we have, this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release, and this is what it looked like at Stanford. So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from. Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this. If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one, which is probably best known for burning, is, don't just have one copy. So we've started to \u2014 we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria. So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria. And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam. So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco, flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ... so we're hedging our bets here. If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.There's a political and social question out of this. Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private? There's some large companies that have seen this vision, that are doing large-scale digitization, but they're locking up the public domain. The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in? What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward? How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up? So universal access to all knowledge \u2014 I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind, like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria. It could be something that we're remembered for, for millennia, for having achieved. And as I said before, I'll end with something that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library. Carnegie \u2014 one of the great capitalists of this country \u2014 carved above his legacy, \"Free to the People.\" Thank you very much.", "id": 346, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nWe really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:20.958\nIf we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.\n\n00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nThey're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\na bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nwithin reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nI'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nOne is what's on the Boston Public Library.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nCarved above their door is, \"Free to All.\"\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nIt's kind of an inspiring statement,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nand I'll go back at the end of this.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nI'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nto as many people as want to read it.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nAnd the idea of using technology is perfect for us.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nI think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nIt's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nthey were able to build the Library of Alexandria --\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthe idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThe problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nOn the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nAnd I'm going to try to argue only one point today:\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nthat universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nSo if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nyeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\neverything that was ever meant for distribution,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\navailable to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nYes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand that's still being refigured out.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nBut I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nso we can actually achieve that.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut I'm going to go over the technological, social\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nAnd the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nthe books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\njust go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nSo if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nWell, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nIf you wanted to put all of the published works online\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nso that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWell, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nis the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nIt is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nAnd a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nso -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nSo a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nit goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.958\n26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.958\non spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nSo for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nyou can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nThat's pretty neat.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nThen the question is, what do you get?\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nYou know, is it worth trying to get there?\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nDo you actually want it online?\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nSome of the first things that people do is they make book readers\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nAnd you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nAnd you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nThere's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nthat look a whole lot like books in certain ways,\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nand you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nstill very book-like -- on your laptop.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nBut I don't know, reading things on a laptop --\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nwhenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nI think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nI don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nIt's starting to be a little bit more specified.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nBut I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nI like the physical book.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nAnd I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nput them on the Net, and then download,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nprint them and bind them, and end up with books again.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd we sort of said, well, how hard is this?\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nAnd it turns out to not be very hard.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nWe actually went off to make a bookmobile.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nAnd a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\na printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nIt costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nAnd they actually come out kind of nice looking.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nYou can actually get really good-looking books\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nfor on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nSo the idea of -- this technology actually may end up\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nputting books back in people's hands again.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nThere are some other bookmobiles running around.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nThis is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThis is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nfor competing with the bookstore there.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nIn India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nthe new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIt was quite popularly attended.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nAnd kids starting to make their own books,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nand a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nSo the idea of being able to use this technology\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nbut I think it still has its place.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nsort of world,\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nwe thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nwe might have something.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nSo we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nAnd we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nfly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nat the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nand get a program going making books in rural Uganda.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd it actually -- so technologically, it works.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nWhat we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nSo the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbut we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nEverybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThere are some newer technologies for delivering\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nthat have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nOne is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe have one of these things now. It's completely cool.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nIt's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nAnd it's called the \"Espresso Book Machine,\"\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nand in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nSomething else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nbeyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nis some of these new little screens that are coming out.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nAnd I don't mean to steal any thunder here,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nbut we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo here's one of the beta units and you can --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nit actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand it turns out that 200 dots per inch\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nmeans that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nAt 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nWe're in good enough shape.\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nYou actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nSo the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nBut how do you go about doing all this scanning?\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nSo we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nAnd there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nsent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nWell, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nSo we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThe lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nIf you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nespecially if they're valuable books.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nIf they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbecause you could just buy another one,\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthat's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBut do things that you love.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nBut the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nabout 300,000 now -- doing very well.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nThe Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nBut we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nHow do we go and do this, and how do we get it down\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nso that it's a cost point that we could afford?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nIf it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nmake it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nwe would have achieved something.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nAnd we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nsort of these auto-page-turning things.\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nIf we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nBut it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nand with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.958\ncontrolled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nyou can go and get the proper intonation.\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nSo you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nThis is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nas you're going through these libraries.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nThis is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAnd actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nPeople seem to love it.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nYes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nin languages that you can read.\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nWe actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nSo 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\n26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nBut a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nand that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nAnd what we've been able to do is get into libraries.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nWe've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand libraries are up for having their books scanned.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nThe Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nwhich is where we have one these scanning centers,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nand scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nSo we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThe thing we're missing is the 10 cents.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nIf we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nWe've scanned about 200,000 books.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nNow we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nand it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo all in all, that's going very well.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nAnd we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:30.958\ninto the out-of-print world.\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nSo I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nAnd I think we'll meet in the middle some place,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand have the classic thing that you have,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nwhich is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nExactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nBut anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nthe Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nthat are starting to participate in this program,\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nto try out this model of where does a library stop\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand where does the bookstore take over.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nSo all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWe're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nSo, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nand we've got about 250,000 books online,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ncounting all the other projects that are starting to add in.\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nSo what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nThe idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nYes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nbut one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nAnd then, there's business model issues\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nabout how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nBut it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nat least for the out of print and out of copyright,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nwe suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nNow let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nSo how much is there?\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nWell, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nhaving been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nor at least that's the largest archives of published materials\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nwe've been able to sort of point at.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nIt costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nand put it online, if you're doing things in volume.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nBut we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThis is a fairly heavily litigated area,\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nso we've found that there are niches in the music world\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nthat aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nAnd we've been starting to make these available by going\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nand offering shelf space on the Net.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nIn the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nIf you give something to a charity or to the public,\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nyou get a pat on the back and a tax donation --\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nexcept on the Net, where you can go broke.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nIf you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nyou can lose your guitars or your house.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThis doesn't make any sense.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nSo we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nto anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nThe rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nas long as nobody made any money. You could --\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nconcert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nbut concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nAnd we get about two or three bands a day signing up.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nThey give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nWe have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nup on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:57.958\nSo audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWe've got a lot of collections now --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:03.958\na couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nMoving images: if you think of theatrical releases,\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nthere are not that many of them.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nAs best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nthat are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nBut half of those were Indian.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nBut anyway, it's doable,\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nbut we've only found about a thousand of these things that --\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nto be out of copyright.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nSo we've digitized those and made those available.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nBut we've found that there's lots of other types of movies\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nthat haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nWe've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nall sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nSo we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nWe're not quite a YouTube.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nWe tended towards longer-term things\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nand also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nwhich has just been great fun.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nTelevision comes quite a bit larger.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nWe started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nIt's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nIt's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nRussian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\n24 hours a day.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWe only put one week up,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nwhich is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nsort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nCNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.\n\n00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nWere they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nHow can we have critical thinking without being able to quote\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nand being able to compare what happened in the past?\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nAnd television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nexcept by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nSo anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nSo 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nwe're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nand have them up on the Net.\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nAnd we've got, now, a lot of these materials.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:09.958\nSo we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.\n\n00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nSo books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nMostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nBut we've worked through some of those,\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nbut we've still got real problems in Washington.\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nWell, we're best known as the World Wide Web.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nWe've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nWe take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nAnd actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nwhich donates this collection to the Internet Archive.\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nAnd it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nAnd we've made a Wayback Machine\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nthat you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:59.958\nIf you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,\n\n00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nthe different versions of it that we have,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nthis is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nand this is what it looked like at Stanford.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nSo anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nMostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nIf there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nwhich is probably best known for burning,\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nis, don't just have one copy.\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nSo we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.958\nand we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nSo this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nAnd we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nSo, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nflood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...\n\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.958\nso we're hedging our bets here.\n\n00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nIf we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nThere's a political and social question out of this.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nIs all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:03.958\nThere's some large companies that have seen this vision,\n\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.958\nthat are doing large-scale digitization,\n\n00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nbut they're locking up the public domain.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:10.958\nThe question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?\n\n00:19:10.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nWhat's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nHow do we go and have a world where we both have libraries\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nand publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nSo universal access to all knowledge --\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nI think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nlike the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.\n\n00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nIt could be something that we're remembered for,\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nfor millennia, for having achieved.\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nAnd as I said before, I'll end with something\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nthat's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nCarnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:49.958\ncarved above his legacy, \"Free to the People.\"\n\n00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nThank you very much."}, {"title": "Life in the deep oceans", "duration": "800", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_gallo_on_life_in_the_deep_oceans", "transcript": "(Applause) David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo. And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video. We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen, and we're not going to show you any of it. (Laughter)The truth of the matter is that the Titanic \u2014 even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records \u2014 it's not the most exciting story from the sea. And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted. When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet. Most of the planet is ocean water. The average depth is about two miles. Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach, or we see images like this of the ocean, and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides, but you have no idea for what lies in there. And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet. Most of the animals are in the oceans. Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea. The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests. It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world. We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world. We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras, and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony. Marcel Proust said, \"The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.\" People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists \u2014 the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea \u2014 but also how we think about life on the planet itself.Here's a jelly. It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts. This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans. It gets up to about 150 feet long. But see all those different working things? I love that kind of stuff. It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down. It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that. It's a colonial animal. These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature. And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment, and a little light. If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that, put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side, those guys win hands down.Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this. Here's the X-wing death jelly. (Laughter) The bioluminescence \u2014 they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating. We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies. They come in all different sizes and shapes.Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom. And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space, that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored. You hear about giant squid and things like that, but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long. They're very little understood.DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod. You can actually see through his head. And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up. We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths. They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet. They come right up to the submarine \u2014 they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.This is really a world within a world, and we're going to show you two. In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this. This is kind of like an undersea rooster. This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way. And then one of my favorites. What a face! This is basically scientific data that you're looking at. It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing, is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this, in the world where they belong. They don't catch them in a net. They're actually looking at them down in that world. We're going to take a joystick, sit in front of our computer, on the Earth, and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile long mountain range. The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half. And we're over the Atlantic \u2014 that's the ridge right there \u2014 but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America, and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north. We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges. We're coming around a cliff here on the right. The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases. And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.This is a volcanic ridge. We're getting down further and further in scale. And eventually, we can come up with something like this.This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called. And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world \u2014 this world, this unexplored region \u2014 back to the laboratory. Because we see it in bits and pieces right now. We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine. This is what's called a hydrothermal vent. And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed, hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor. Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range. So that's all water under the sea \u2014 a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down. And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s. And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism, water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor, come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot. We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides. We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.This is one of these hydrothermal vents. Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth. On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps, so the setting here is very dramatic.BL: The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees C.DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. And we started to wonder for a long time, how did it all get down there? What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth. Not only is it coming out of the Earth \u2014 so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity \u2014 but that bacteria supports these colonies of life. The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch. A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles \u2014 no sun has ever gotten down here. All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth \u2014 so, chemosynthesis. And you can see how dense the population is. These are called tube worms.BL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth. But they have two types of gill structures. One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria, which takes the hydrothermal fluid \u2014 that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom \u2014 and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there. He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them. Oh! Good going. So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails. There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology.BL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme. Their foot is at about 200 degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C, so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water. That's how they like to live. (Laughter)DG: This is a female of this kind of worm. And here's a male. You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here \u2014 this one and one that will show up over here \u2014 start to fight. Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea. There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring. Here they go. On one of the last dive series, we counted 200 species in these areas \u2014 198 were new, new species.BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals. And they disintegrate on the way up, so the imagery is critical for the science.DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth. This pressure thing really amazes me \u2014 that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can. What we saw up till now was from the Pacific. This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth. You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here, and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack! (Laughter)And the same thing's going on over here. What they're getting at is that \u2014 on the back of this crab \u2014 the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals. And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals. And the crabs don't like it at all. These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria. So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab. On the back, you see this again. The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents. Those are all shrimp. You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out. They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face. Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar. Those pillars get up to several stories. So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground. They don't need the sun at all.BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp? It's actually a light-sensing organ. It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. The vents are emitting a black body radiation \u2014 an IR signature \u2014 and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. This is the first time we've ever tried this any place. We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific. We're moving up one of these pillars. This one's several stories tall. In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals. There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it. So all of these are individual homes for worms.Now here's a closer view of that community. Here's crabs here, worms here. There are smaller animals crawling around. Here's pagoda structures. I think this is the neatest-looking thing. I just can't get over this \u2014 that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way. You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it. (Laughter) It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates. And animals are thriving \u2014 and we probably came from here. That's probably where we evolved from.BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found. There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites. Although the vent sites are short-lived \u2014 an individual site may last only 10 years or so \u2014 as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions \u2014 well, billions \u2014 of years.DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well. There's a fish sitting here. Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm, waiting for that worm to stick his head out. (Laughter)BL: The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active. The worms are growing inches per week!DG: I already said that this site, from a human perspective, is toxic as hell. Not only that, but on top \u2014 the lifeblood \u2014 that plumbing system turns off every year or so. Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move. And then there's earthquakes, and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years, that completely wipes the area out. Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time. You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again, higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life. Is it sensitive? Yes. Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.I'll end up with saying one thing. There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea, in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor. It's an incredible story. What we see when we look back in time, in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history. Everything on this planet \u2014 everything \u2014 works by cycles and rhythms. The continents move apart. They come back together. Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go. El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic. What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony. It's just like music \u2014 it really is just like music. And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say, \"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today.\" It's absurd. It's just absurd. So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it. Learn to manage it. The concept of preservation is futile. Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there. Thank you very much. Thank you.

I'm Dave Gallo.\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.958\nAnd we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nWe've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nand we're not going to show you any of it.\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nThe truth of the matter is that the Titanic --\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.958\neven though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --\n\n00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nit's not the most exciting story from the sea.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nWhen you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nMost of the planet is ocean water.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nThe average depth is about two miles.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nPart of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nor we see images like this of the ocean,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nand it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nbut you have no idea for what lies in there.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:02.958\nAnd in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nMost of the animals are in the oceans.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nMost of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nat the bottom of the sea.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nThe biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.958\nthan it is in the rainforests.\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nIt's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nthat captivate us and make us become familiar with it.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nBut when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nthat you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nWe have to have a very special technology\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nto get into that unfamiliar world.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nand the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nMarcel Proust said, \"The true voyage of discovery\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:40.958\nis not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.\"\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nPeople that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nnot only on what exists --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthe new landscapes at the bottom of the sea --\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nbut also how we think about life on the planet itself.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nHere's a jelly.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nIt's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nThis turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nIt gets up to about 150 feet long.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nBut see all those different working things?\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nI love that kind of stuff.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nIt's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nIt's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIt's a colonial animal.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThese are all individual animals\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nbanding together to make this one creature.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd it's got these jet thrusters up in front\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nthat it'll use in a moment, and a little light.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nIf you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nput them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:25.958\non the other side, those guys win hands down.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nMost of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nHere's the X-wing death jelly.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:33.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThe bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand attracting prey and communicating.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nWe couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThey come in all different sizes and shapes.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nBill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\non average, and that we're real familiar with the animals\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nthat are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nwith what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd these are the types of animals\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nthat live in that three-dimensional space,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.958\nthat micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nYou hear about giant squid and things like that,\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nbut some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nThey're very little understood.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nDG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nYou can actually see through his head.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nAnd here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nWe see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nThey go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nThey come right up to the submarine --\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nthey'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nThis is really a world within a world,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nand we're going to show you two.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nIn this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nThis is kind of like an undersea rooster.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThis guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd then one of my favorites. What a face!\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThis is basically scientific data that you're looking at.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nIt's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nAnd that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nis providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nin the world where they belong.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nThey don't catch them in a net.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThey're actually looking at them down in that world.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nWe're going to take a joystick,\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nsit in front of our computer, on the Earth,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nand press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nWe're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\na 40,000-mile long mountain range.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nThe average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nAnd we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbut we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nand end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nWe make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nand this is one of those mountain ranges.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nWe're coming around a cliff here on the right.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nThe height of these mountains on either side of this valley\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nis greater than the Alps in most cases.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nThis is a volcanic ridge.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nWe're getting down further and further in scale.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nAnd eventually, we can come up with something like this.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThis is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nAnd you can sit in a room like this,\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nwith a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\naround the bottom of the ocean in real time.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nOne of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nis to bring this virtual world --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nthis world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nBecause we see it in bits and pieces right now.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nWe see it either as sound, or we see it as video,\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nor we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nbut we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nHere's where Bill's cameras really do shine.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nThis is what's called a hydrothermal vent.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nAnd what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nhydrogen-sulfide-rich water\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\ncoming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nGets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nSo that's all water under the sea --\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.958\na mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nAnd we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nAnd then we had some hint that these things existed\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nall along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nwater's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\ncome in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nWe weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nWe didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThis is one of these hydrothermal vents.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nSix hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nOn either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nso the setting here is very dramatic.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nBL: The white material is a type of bacteria\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nthat thrives at 180 degrees C.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nDG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nthat we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nis that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nafter a volcanic eruption is bacteria.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nAnd we started to wonder for a long time,\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nhow did it all get down there?\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWhat we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.958\nNot only is it coming out of the Earth --\n\n00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nso, biogenesis made from volcanic activity --\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbut that bacteria supports these colonies of life.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThe pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nA mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles --\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nno sun has ever gotten down here.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAll the energy to support these life forms\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nis coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd you can see how dense the population is.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nThese are called tube worms.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nBL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nBut they have two types of gill structures.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOne for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nanother one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nwhich takes the hydrothermal fluid --\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nthat hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom --\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nand converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nDG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nHe's managed to grab a tip of these worms.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nNow, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nOh! Good going.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nSo, as soon as a crab touches them,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nthey retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nThere's a whole story being played out here\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nthat we're just now beginning to have some idea of\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nbecause of this new camera technology.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nBL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nTheir foot is at about 200 degrees C\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nand their head is out at three degrees C,\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nso it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThat's how they like to live.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nDG: This is a female of this kind of worm.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nAnd here's a male.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nYou watch.

Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts. You still with me? (Laughter) I called her up. \"Hello, how're you doing, baby?\" \"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you.\" \"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?\" I said, \"I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.\" \"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went to the White House.\" \"Ma, don't start!\" And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said, \"What's the problem?\" And I said, \"Well, I'm not sure.\" I said, \"I have to talk to them about stories. It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'\" And she said, \"Well, you design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're going to use a microphone.\" (Laughter) I said, \"You're a peach, ma. Pop there?\" \"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?\" (Laughter) Then my pop got on there. My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know \u2014 old Cuban man from Camaguey. Camaguey is a province in Cuba. He's from Florida. He was born there in 1924. He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors, and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos, our old Arawak ancestors. My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny, and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless. \"Papi, help.\" \"I already heard your mother. I think she's right.\" (Laughter) \"After what I just told you?\" My whole life, my father's been there. So we talked for a few minutes, and he said, \"Why don't you tell them what you believe?\" I love that, but we don't have the time. Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to. Great story is the art of letting go. So I'm going to tell you a little story. Remember, this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still, before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus, or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves. Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story. When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story. Have you been watching the commercials? Because every one of us has this desire, for once \u2014 just once \u2014 to tell our story and have it heard. There are stories you tell from stages. There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine. And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend, maybe once in your life. And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness. I'm not telling you that story. I'm telling you this one. It's called, \"You're Going to Miss Me.\" It's about human connection. My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch, came to the United States one thousand years ago. I was born in 19 \u2014 I forget, and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution. We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia. And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town. And in that little Southern town, I grew up, and grew up hearing these stories. But this story only happened a few years ago. I called my mom. It was a Saturday morning. And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal. It's delicious. It's savory. It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth \u2014 is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know? That kind of food, yeah. This is the sensory part of the program, people. I called my mother, and she said, \"Carmen, I need you to come, please. I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now, he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go. I got an errand to run.\" Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you \u2014 Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago, to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta. Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child, guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights. But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue, and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport. \"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?\" (Spanish) \"You don't speak English?\" \"No.\" (Laughter) But eventually, every dog has its day, and she ended up in traffic court, where she bartered with the judge for a discount. There's a historical marker. But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving. And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed, you know, that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit, you know, same color as the Buick. Anybody? All right. Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops. Rockports \u2014 they're for this. That's why they call them that. (Laughter) This is her ensemble. And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing. I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's. I show up. She's in the carport. Of course, they have a carport. The kind with the corrugated roof, you know. The Buick's parked outside, and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys. \"I got a surprise for you, baby!\" \"We taking your car?\" \"Not we, I.\" And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe. Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me. Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license. Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett. Blithering fucking idiots. (Laughter) I said, \"Is that thing real?\" \"I think so.\" \"Can you even see?\" \"I guess I must.\" \"Oh, Jesus.\" She gets into the car \u2014 she's sitting on two phone books. I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny. She's engineered an umbrella so she can \u2014 bam! \u2014 slam the door. Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed. \"You coming? You no coming?\" \"Oh, my God.\" I said, \"OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?\" \"Are you kidding me?\" \"How are you doing it?\" \"He's got to sleep sometime.\" And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car. Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse. I am buckling in seatbelts from the front. I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots. I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert. I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about? And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of birth breathing \u2014 you know, that one? Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right. And I said, \"Ma, would you slow down?\" Because now she's picked up the Highway 285, the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now \u2014 there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all. I said, \"Ma, pick a lane!\" \"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them.\" And there she goes, right. I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped. So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion. It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe. \"Mommy, I know you have been stopped.\" \"No, no, what you talking about?\" \"You have a license. How long have you been driving?\" \"Four or five days.\" \"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?\" \"I did not get a ticket.\" I said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on.\" \"OK, so I stopped at a light and there's a guy, you know, in the back.\" \"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face?\" \"You weren't there, don't start.\" \"Come on. You got a ticket?\" \"No.\" She explained, \"The man\" \u2014 I have to tell you as she did, because it loses something if I don't, you know \u2014 \"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this, which tells me he's pretty old, you know. So I look up and I'm thinking, maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.\" \"Ma, are you still doing that?\" \"If it works, it works, baby. So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.' Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps.\" (Laughter) So he's talking to her, and at some point she says, \"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done.\" \"Yeah? What? He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?\" \"No, I look up, and the light, she change.\" (Laughter) You should be terrified. Now, I don't know if she's toying with me, kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse \u2014 left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw \u2014 but by now, we've reached the mall. Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes? Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes. Audience: Yes. Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory, praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along, some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. But that doesn't happen most of the time, right? So, first I say, \"Ma, why are we here?\" \"You mean, like, in the car?\" \"No, don't \u2014 why are we here today? It's Saturday. It's the holidays.\" \"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear.\" Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking, that you really have to \u2014 you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren, this woman's mind. Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor \u2014 enough metaphors for you? \u2014 somewhere, I may not get out. But you know. (Laughter) \"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now? And why? What is wrong with his underwear?\" \"It will upset you.\" \"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?\" \"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot. I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake, and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers, and he's supposed to buy the boxers.\" \"Why?\" \"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children.\" \"Oh, my God!\" (Laughter) Olivia? Huh? Huh? By now, we have now crawled another four feet, and my mother finally says to me, \"I knew it, I knew it. I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there.\" And she points out the passenger window, and I look out, and three \u2014 three \u2014 aisles down, \"Look, the Chevy.\" You want to laugh, but you don't know \u2014 you're that politically corrected, have you noticed? Correct the other direction now, it's OK. \"Look, the Chevy \u2014 he's coming this way.\" \"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away.\" She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child, the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly. \"I know that, honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there.\" OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no. How many of you once in your \u2014 you were a kid, you were an adult \u2014 you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone? See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake. (Laughter) And years of therapy later, we're doing great. We're doing great. We're doing fine. Well, I stood up to her. This is \u2014 you know, you'd think by now I'm \u2014 and still holding? I said, \"No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life.\" Of course, her comeback is, \"When have I embarrassed you?\" (Spanish) And she's still talking while she puts the car in park, hits the emergency brake, opens the door, and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age, she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books, and then she walks around \u2014 she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her \u2014 around the front of the car. She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too. Before I know it, she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars, and people behind me, with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah. \"I'm coming.\" Italian hand signals follow. I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books. This is new and fast, just so you \u2014 are you still with us? We'll wait for the slow ones. OK. I start, and this is where a child says to me \u2014 and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before, because this is my laconic child. A brevity, brevity of everything with this child. You know, she eats small portions. Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes, you know \u2014 just little hmm, hmm-hmm. She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen. She wields great power. She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first. But she pauses occasionally and says, \"How do you spell that? What year? OK.\" When she writes the expose in about 20 years, don't believe a word of it. But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter, my borderline Asperger's kid. Bless you, Dr. Watson. She says, \"Ma, you got to look!\" Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know. But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before. I grew up with this woman. I said, \"Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't.\" \"No, mama, you got to look.\" I got to look. You got to look. Don't you want to look? There she is. I look in bewildered awe: she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded. She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it. She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like, \"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!\" (Laughter) Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes. \"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick. Honey, sit up so they can see you.\" Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. I finally come \u2014 and now, it's the South. I don't know what part of the country you live in. I think we all secretly love stories. We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear. We want to curl up and say, \"Tell it to me, tell it to me. Come on, honey, tell it to me.\" But in the South, we love a good story. People have pulled aside, I mean, they've come out of that queue line, they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. Bets are placed. \"I'm with the little lady. Damn!\" (Laughter) And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement. She is, after all, Cuban. I'm thinking, \"Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break.\" Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah. I pull in. I put the car in park. Engine's still running \u2014 mine, not the car. I jump out next to her going, \"Don't you move!\" \"I'm not going anywhere.\" She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy. I come out, and there's Esther. She's hugging the purse. \"Que?\" Which means \"what,\" and so much more. (Laughter) \"Ma, have you no shame? People are watching us all around,\" right? Now, some of them you've got to make up, people. Secret of the trade. Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there. Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there. She says this to me. After I say \u2014 let me refresh you \u2014 \"have you no shame?\" \"No. I gave it up with pantyhose \u2014 they're both too binding.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end. I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder. Intrepid soul. I'm thinking, \"This is my kid. How dare she? She jumped out of that car.\" That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her. It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works. (Laughter) I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman, a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes. With her is a young man \u2014 husband, brother, lover, it's not my job. And she says, \"Pardon me, ma'am\" \u2014 that's how we talk down there \u2014 \"is that your mother?\" I said, \"No, I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!\" The boy, now, he says. \"Well, what my sister meant\" \u2014 they look at each other, it's a knowing glance \u2014 \"God, she's crazy!\" I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say, \"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing.\" I said, \"Look, please, let me take care of her, OK, because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon, you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly.\" And the girl goes, \"I know, but, I mean, I swear to God, she reminds us of our mother.\" I almost miss it. He turns to her on the heel of his shoe. It's a half-whisper, \"God, I miss her.\" They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away, lost in their own reverie. Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw. And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says, \"You know what, honey?\" \"What, ma?\" \"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years, if you're lucky, but after that, honey, you're going to miss me.\" (Applause)", "id": 347, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nWhen I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.958\n\"I gotta call my mother.\"\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.958\nFour feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.\n\n00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nYou still with me? (Laughter)\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:28.958\nI called her up.\n\n00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:30.958\n\"Hello, how're you doing, baby?\"\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.958\n\"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you.\"\n\n00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:34.958\n\"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?\"\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nI said, \"I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.\"\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.958\n\"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nto the White House.\"\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.958\n\"Ma, don't start!\"\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nAnd I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:47.958\n\"What's the problem?\"\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd I said, \"Well, I'm not sure.\"\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nI said, \"I have to talk to them about stories.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nIt's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'\"\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd she said, \"Well, you design a story when you make it up,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nit's entertainment when you tell it,\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nand you're going to use a microphone.\"\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nI said, \"You're a peach, ma. Pop there?\"\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958\n\"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nleaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?\"\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThen my pop got on there.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nMy pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nold Cuban man from Camaguey.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nCamaguey is a province in Cuba.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nHe's from Florida.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nHe was born there in 1924.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nHe grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nour old Arawak ancestors.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nMy father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\n\"Papi, help.\"\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.958\n\"I already heard your mother. I think she's right.\"\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\n\"After what I just told you?\"\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nMy whole life, my father's been there.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nSo we talked for a few minutes, and he said,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:15.958\n\"Why don't you tell them what you believe?\"\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI love that, but we don't have the time.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nGood storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nGreat story is the art of letting go.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nSo I'm going to tell you a little story.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nRemember, this tradition comes to us\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nnot from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nbefore we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nor we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nBack then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nWhen Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nHave you been watching the commercials?\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nBecause every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto tell our story and have it heard.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nThere are stories you tell from stages.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nThere's stories that you may tell\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nin a small group of people with some good wine.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nAnd there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nmaybe once in your life.\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nAnd then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI'm not telling you that story.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI'm telling you this one.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.958\nIt's called, \"You're Going to Miss Me.\"\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nIt's about human connection.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nMy Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nin that short character sketch,\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:51.958\ncame to the United States one thousand years ago.\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nI was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nwith them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nWe went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nAnd Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nAnd in that little Southern town, I grew up,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand grew up hearing these stories.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nBut this story only happened a few years ago.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nI called my mom.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nIt was a Saturday morning.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nAnd I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nIt's delicious.

It turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity, to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard, and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years, the blackboards were fine, but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them.And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth, because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now, the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.(Laughter)That's not what I'm here to talk about, but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about, I had recently come back from Jordan, where I had an amazing experience with a camel.(Laughter)And we were in the desert.Richard Wurman: That's the end! Keith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.We were in the desert, in Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep. There were four of us, two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand, 105 degrees, one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert, the Jeep broke down. The guys got out, they put the hood up, they started working under the hood, got it going again. About a hundred yards, it broke down. This went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed, we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.And eventually, our worst nightmare happened: they flooded the engine. And they said, \"Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk.\" And we said, \"We get out and walk?\" One water bottle, remember, guys, four people. And they said, \"Yeah, yeah, we'll walk. We'll find some camels.\" We got out and walked, and sure enough, about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill, and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering, and 10 dollars later, we had four camels. They went down like elevators; we got on them. They went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them, got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels, and they started galloping. And if you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride. There's also one other aspect about these camels. About every 10 steps, they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg.(Laughter)So we kept on going, and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination, where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators, we sort of clumsily get off, and they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point, and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the States.So as we talked, Richard and I, I said, \"You know, maybe I should bring a camel. It's the best designed animal in the world.\" He went, \"Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel.\" And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said, \"I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up; take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.\"So, I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there, and I took one look at this camel. It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.(Laughter)Now, if you've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in rut, it is a scary, scary thing to behold. And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel, someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.(Laughter)So we got as close to it as possible, and I'm going to share this. Chris, if you want to roll this film. Then I'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels.Do you want to roll the film?(Adventure music)(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit. I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine.(Music continues)Keith Bellows: And you'll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel all day.(Video) That's it, OK. No! See, now he's getting a little overexcited. So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you. Now, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there. I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose, you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut, they're similar to seals in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose.KB: Ears?SK: They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear that's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes, but there's the secondary \u2014 I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer.Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand. Hooves? They don't have traditional hooves, but they do have one, like, big nail.(Audience laughter)You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over. But they use their tails a lot, especially in rut. He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive. I don't know why that would be, but it works for them. So, what the hell.(Audience laughter)Now, they will also defecate in certain areas. Generally, they poop wherever they want to, but during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas. I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants, you know what I mean, like, \"Br-r-r!\" These big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing. You can actually see, right here, it will vibrate. We weigh our animals. Unfortunately, he's a very aggressive animal, so he's actually destroyed some of the scales. We had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance. I'm guessing that he's at least 1,600 pounds. But I would put him closer to 2,000. He's basically a walking mulch pile. We're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well.KB: He sees you as competition? Senior Keeper: Yeah, exactly. And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year. Don't even think about it. Don't think about it!But now, we're going to meet. Out! Out! Out! No. Out!(Music)(Applause)KB: What I didn't show you was, you got that swinging thing going? Well, and you're glad I didn't show you this. One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream, and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now, what you also didn't see was that \u2014 and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?I'm going to show you another film. But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee, it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it, please?Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate. I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs \u2014 and I'm very well ... hung. I'm TED Camel. The perfect desert machine. I'm smartly designed. Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose \u2014 with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips \u2014 that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump? Ogden Nash once wrote: \"The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two, or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?\" Here's a hint: Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn't store H2O. I'm built to last. I'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won't sweat until my body reaches 105 \u00baF, enough to fry an egg. I'm able to lose 40% of my weight without dying. (Most animals would if they lost half that much.) I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I'm powerful. Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse \u2014 And cover 26 miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand. (Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?) I'm a good provider, too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese. \"Camels are like angels,\" a Bedouin once said.(Applause)Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought, which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large, we really don't have to adapt to our environment; we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference, not just this year, but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom, that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it; it has to adapt to the environment.Ricky, thank you very much for having me.RW: That's terrific. Thank you.", "id": 345, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:18.934\n[SHIT]\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:21.934\nThis is arguably the back end\nof the design of animals.\n\n00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:28.378\nBut the reason\nI put this up here is because\n\n00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:32.513\nwhen I was in Africa last year,\nmy wife and I were driving around,\n\n00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:34.759\nwe had this wonderful guide,\n\n00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:37.934\nwho showed us something\nthat surprised both of us,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.934\nand it was very revealing\nin terms of the fascination\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.934\nthat comes with the design of animals.\n\n00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:46.934\nIt turns out that in about the 1880s,\nthe missionaries came to Africa\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.934\nto spread the word of Christianity,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.935\nto teach English to the natives.\n\n00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:53.852\nAnd they brought blackboards and chalk.\n\n00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.429\nAnd I'd like you to imagine\nthat that's a blackboard,\n\n00:00:56.453 --> 00:00:58.275\nand I just used some chalk on there.\n\n00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.700\nAnd they brought\nquite a bit of this stuff.\n\n00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:03.361\nBut over the years,\nthe blackboards were fine,\n\n00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:05.362\nbut they ran out of chalk.\n\n00:01:05.386 --> 00:01:07.386\nAnd this is a real crisis for them.\n\n00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.259\nAnd that's where the hyena comes in.\n\n00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:13.034\nThe hyena is probably\nthe most perfectly designed\n\n00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:14.935\nscavenging animal in the world.\n\n00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.934\nIt strip-mines carcasses,\nand it has amazing teeth,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.751\nbecause it enables the hyena\nto essentially eat bones.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nNow, the end product of that action\nis up on the board here.\n\n00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.623\nWhat the missionaries would do is,\nthey'd walk around\n\n00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.711\nand they'd pick up hyena shit.\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:40.434\nAnd the incredible thing\nabout hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.\n\n00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.013\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:42.037 --> 00:01:43.934\nThat's not what I'm here to talk about,\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.569\nbut it is a fascinating aspect\nof animal design.\n\n00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:50.934\nWhat I'm here to talk about is the camel.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.934\nWhen I started talking to Richard\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.934\nabout what I was going to speak about,\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.582\nI had recently come back from Jordan,\n\n00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.828\nwhere I had an amazing\nexperience with a camel.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.379\nAnd we were in the desert.\n\n00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:08.220\nRichard Wurman: That's the end!\nKeith Bellows: Yeah, yeah.\n\n00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.489\nWe were in the desert,\nin Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.\n\n00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:13.513\nThere were four of us,\ntwo Bedouin drivers.\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:17.845\nYou can just imagine,\nthis expanse is an ocean of sand,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\n105 degrees, one water bottle.\n\n00:02:20.656 --> 00:02:25.918\nAnd we were driving in what they told us\nwas their very, very best Jeep.\n\n00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.560\nDidn't look like it to me.\n\n00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:31.486\nAnd as we started to go\nthrough the desert,\n\n00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:33.934\nthe Jeep broke down.\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.934\nThe guys got out, they put the hood up,\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.633\nthey started working\nunder the hood, got it going again.\n\n00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:40.427\nAbout a hundred yards, it broke down.\n\n00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.728\nThis went on about 6-7 times,\nwe were getting more and more alarmed,\n\n00:02:43.752 --> 00:02:46.410\nwe were also getting deeper\nand deeper into the desert.\n\n00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:48.934\nAnd eventually,\nour worst nightmare happened:\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:50.934\nthey flooded the engine.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.682\nAnd they said, \"Ah, no problem!\nWe just get out and walk.\"\n\n00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:56.935\nAnd we said, \"We get out and walk?\"\n\n00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.211\nOne water bottle, remember,\nguys, four people.\n\n00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:02.592\nAnd they said, \"Yeah, yeah, we'll walk.\nWe'll find some camels.\"\n\n00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:04.855\nWe got out and walked, and sure enough,\n\n00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.489\nabout half a mile, we came\nover the crest of this hill,\n\n00:03:07.513 --> 00:03:10.411\nand there was a huge gathering\nof Bedouin with their camels.\n\n00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:12.330\nThe guy went up and started dickering,\n\n00:03:12.354 --> 00:03:14.934\nand 10 dollars later, we had four camels.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.476\nThey went down like elevators;\nwe got on them.\n\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.934\nThey went back up, and the Bedouin,\neach Bedouin, four of them,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.934\ngot behind each of the camels\nwith a little whip.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.934\nAnd they started slashing away\nat the back of the camels,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.250\nand they started galloping.\n\n00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:31.751\nAnd if you've ever been on a camel,\nit is a very, very uncomfortable ride.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.934\nThere's also one other aspect\nabout these camels.\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.934\nAbout every 10 steps, they lean back\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.934\nand try to take a chunk out of your leg.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.037\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.934\nSo we kept on going,\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.934\nand this camel kept on trying\nto take a chunk out of my leg.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.092\nAnd eventually, three miles later,\nwe arrived at our destination,\n\n00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.934\nwhere a Jeep was supposed to meet us.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.275\nAnd the camels come down\nagain like elevators,\n\n00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:53.934\nwe sort of clumsily get off,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.934\nand they, obviously, try to take\nanother chunk out of my leg.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.934\nAnd I've developed\na very wonderful relationship\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.934\nwith this creature by this point,\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nand I've realized\nthat this is a mean son of a bitch.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.934\nAnd much meaner, by the way,\nthan the Bedouin who greeted me\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.498\nand tried to sell me\none of his 26 daughters\n\n00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.498\nto take back to the States.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.832\nSo as we talked, Richard and I,\n\n00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.117\nI said, \"You know, maybe\nI should bring a camel.\n\n00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:20.374\nIt's the best designed\nanimal in the world.\"\n\n00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:23.282\nHe went, \"Nah. I don't think\nwe want to be bringing a camel.\"\n\n00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:26.443\nAnd you should be really glad\nwe decided not to bring the camel.\n\n00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:27.958\nSo I did the next best thing.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.919\nI went to the Washington Zoo.\n\n00:04:30.943 --> 00:04:35.296\nRichard said, \"I want you to get up\nclose and personal with this camel.\n\n00:04:35.527 --> 00:04:38.471\nI want you to inspect its mouth,\nlook at its teeth.\n\n00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.934\nGo underneath it.\nGo above it. Go around it.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.491\nPull its tail up; take a look in there.\n\n00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:46.934\nI want you to get as close\nto that camel as you possibly can.\"\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.204\nSo, I got a National Geographic film crew.\n\n00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:55.130\nWe went down there,\nand I took one look at this camel.\n\n00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.934\nIt is a 2,000 pound creature\nwho is in rut.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.752\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:06.633\nNow, if you've ever seen\na 2,000 pound camel in rut,\n\n00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:08.894\nit is a scary, scary thing to behold.\n\n00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:13.481\nAnd if Richard thought I was getting\nin the ring with that camel,\n\n00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.934\nsomeone was smoking Bedouin high grade.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.140\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:17.164 --> 00:05:20.934\nSo we got as close to it as possible,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.300\nand I'm going to share this.\n\n00:05:22.324 --> 00:05:24.093\nChris, if you want to roll this film.\n\n00:05:24.117 --> 00:05:25.371\nThen I'm going to show you\n\n00:05:25.395 --> 00:05:27.491\na little bit more\nabout the design of camels.\n\n00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:28.896\nDo you want to roll the film?\n\n00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:31.300\n(Adventure music)\n\n00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:05.899\n(Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows\n\n00:06:05.923 --> 00:06:09.417\nwith the TED National Geographic\nCamel Investigation Unit.\n\n00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.441\nI'm here to look\nat the ultimate desert machine.\n\n00:06:12.874 --> 00:06:15.255\n(Music continues)\n\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.363\nKeith Bellows: And you'll note\nI started chewing gum\n\n00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:24.363\nbecause I was around this camel all day.\n\n00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:26.501\n(Video) That's it, OK. No!\n\n00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.615\nSee, now he's getting\na little overexcited.\n\n00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.214\nSo we'll need to be very careful\naround him.

I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees and 17 locations, 9,600 kids. I'm doing 7,100 meals a day and I've been doing it for two years, trying to change how we feed kids in America. And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today. These are some of my kids with a salad bar. I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there. Everyone says it couldn't be done. Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar, big kids would spit in it \u2014 neither happened.When I took over this, I tried to really figure out, like, what my vision would be. How do we really change children's relationship to food? And I'll tell you why we need to change it, but we absolutely have to change it. And what I came to understand is, we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids. And that if we don't do that, the antithesis, although we've heard otherwise, is we're really going to become extinct, because we're feeding our children to death. That's my premise.We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker. And the reason this is happening, by and large, is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food, the way the government oversees our food, the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools. And by \u2014 tacitly, all of us send our kids, or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school and tell them to learn, you know, learn what's in those schools. And when you feed these kids bad food, that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.The way we got here is because of big agribusiness. We now live in a country where most of us don't decide, by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont, who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet. They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country. These are \u2014 10 companies control much of what's in our grocery stores, much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate, I really started focusing on what we would teach them. And the very first thing was about regional food \u2014 trying to eat food from within our region. And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage, or when \u2014 as the fossil fuel is going away, as oil hits its peak oil, you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should, or could, be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it. So we talked to kids about that, and we really start to feed kids regional food.And then we talk about organic food. Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food, but we, as a nation, have to start thinking about consuming, growing and feeding our children food that's not chock-full of chemicals. We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones. We can't keep doing that. You know, it doesn't work. And the results of that are kids getting sick.One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics. Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry. We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day. Seventy percent \u2014 it's unbelievable. And the result of it is, we have diseases. We have things like E. coli that we can't fix, that we can't make kids better when they get sick. And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed, but it's an issue in the food supply. One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year. That means every one of us, and our children, consumes what would equal a five-pound bag \u2014 those bags you have at home. If I had one here and ripped it open, and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply, because of the way we consume produce in America.The USDA allows these antibiotics, these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply, and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine. Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT, but we know it wasn't good for you and me. And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply. And that has to change, you know. The USDA cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed. We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food. That's what I really try and get people to understand. I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important. It's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet, in which kids will grow up to be healthy, and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing. It really is just a new idea. I mean, people toss around sustainability, but we have to figure out what sustainability is.In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations, we've gone from being 200 \u2014 being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers. We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers \u2014 2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers. And we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison, and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child. It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.(Laughter)And what's happening is, we're getting sick. We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick. It is about what we feed them. What goes in is what we are. We really are what we eat. And if we continue down this path, if we continue to feed kids bad food, if we continue not to teach them what good food is, what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen? What's going to happen to our whole medical system? What's going to happen is, we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own. The CDC, the Center for Disease Control, has said, of the children born in the year 2000 \u2014 those seven- and eight-year-olds today \u2014 one out of every three Caucasians, one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime. And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say, most before they graduate high school. This means that 40 or 45 percent of all school-aged children could be insulin-dependent within a decade. Within a decade.What's going to happen? Well, the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents. And it's because of what we feed them. Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide \u2014 and if they do, you should be in therapy. You know, we are responsible for what kids eat. But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat. Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids. 20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see. They spend 500 dollars for every one dollar \u2014 500 dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy, nutritious food. The result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets.You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more. This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing. And the one over there, that's bigger than my head, is what McDonald's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat. And why can they serve that much? Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers? It's because of the way the government commodifies food, and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really, really cheap. Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think, \"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley.\" Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago. This is not even food. This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos, corn dogs, pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches. Everything came in plastic, in cardboard. The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter. The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can, it came frozen in a box. The USDA allows this. The USDA allows all of this stuff. In case you can't tell, that's, like, pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes. Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose, canned fruit cocktail \u2014 a reimbursable meal.That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids. It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay. And we, all of us, have to understand that this is about us, that we can make a difference here. Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets, but I'm sure you're rich if you did. But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart, a giraffe, a star? Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken. And that they could figure it out, that we could sell this stuff to kids. You know, what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken? But this is what most schools serve. In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve, as opposed to \u2014 this is what we try and serve.We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food. We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe. You know, that vegetables are actually colorful, that they have flavor, that carrots grow in the ground, that strawberries grow in the ground. There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush. You know, we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools.Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh. We have no high-fructose corn syrup, no trans fats, no processed foods. We're cooking from scratch every day. We have 25 percent of our \u2014 (Applause) thank you \u2014 25 percent of our stuff is organic and local. We cook. Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids, because this is what we need to do. We can't keep serving kids processed crap, full of chemicals, and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. You're not going to get the next generation, or the generation after, to be able to think like this if they're not nourished. If they're eating chemicals all the time, they're not going to be able to think. They're not going to be smart. You know what? They're just going to be sick.Now one of the things that \u2014 what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people, very, very different, and I needed to market it. I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent. And these calendars really started to lay out my program. Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. So this is a typical menu. This is what we're serving this week at the schools. And you see these recipes on the side? Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes. They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes. They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. If we're going to change children's relationship to food, it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias, hands-on experience \u2014 you're looking in cooking and gardening classes \u2014 and academic curriculum to tie it all together.Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA, and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid, this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know. You know, run up into the end of the rainbow, I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own. This is available on my website in English and Spanish, and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food. The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables. We have to start changing this. We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference. We have cooking classes \u2014 we have cooking classrooms in our schools. And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation, maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer. What are kids learning? Where is the family time? Where is socialization? Where is discussion? Where is learning to talk? You know, we have to change it.I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem. EATWISE \u2014 Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating. We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast. We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar, they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack. And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools. We have recycling in all of our schools. You know, the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important, we have to teach kids about in school. It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it. Because, you know what, many of us are sort of at the end of our careers, and we need to be giving these kids \u2014 these young kids, the next generation \u2014 the tools to save themselves and save the planet.One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships. I work with private companies who are willing to do R & D with me, who are willing to do distribution for me, who are really willing to work to go into schools. Schools are underfunded. Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child. That comes down to under five dollars an hour. Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them. So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system. And if we're going to change it, and change how we feed kids, we really have to rethink that. So, public and private partnerships, advocacy groups, working with foundations. In our school district, the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent, we could start to really fix this program.We really need to change it. It's going to take more money. Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about kids getting exercise. And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch. It's sort of this \"duh\" thing. You know, if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess, you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing. These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch. So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class, believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.We need to \u2014 we need to educate. We need to educate the kids. We need to educate the staff. I had 90 employees. Two were supposed to be cooks \u2014 none could. And, you know, I'm not that better off now. But we really have to educate. We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again, because, of course, they don't \u2014 because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long. We need 40-minute lunches \u2014 most schools have 20-minute lunches \u2014 and lunches that are time-appropriate. There was just a big study done, and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning. That is not lunchtime.You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing. And just remember, at very least tacitly, this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing. I think if we're going to fix this, one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA, I think it should be under CDC. If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative, and we started thinking about food as health, then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch.Okay, Finance 101 on this, and this \u2014 I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece, because I think this is something we all have to understand. The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year. That number probably needs to double. People say, \"Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?\" In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food. We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids. We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables, which is why we need all the diet aids. We spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today, with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes. 200 billion.So you know what, when we talk about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot. That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents \u2014 that's what the government allocates for lunch. Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools \u2014 most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents. So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch. Now I don't know about you, but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that, and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars. One gourmet coffee, one, is more \u2014 we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools.You know what? We should be ashamed. We, as a country, should be ashamed at that. The richest country. In our country, it's the kids that need it the most, who get this really, really lousy food. It's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food. And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick. Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.We can all make a difference. That every single one of us, whether we have children, whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews, or anything \u2014 that we can make a difference. Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids, whether you take your kids, or grandchildren, or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them. Sit down and care. And on the macro level, we're in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign, and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders, what about asking for the health of our children?

So that's really what this is all about.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nThe way we got here is because of big agribusiness.\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nWe now live in a country where most of us don't decide,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nby and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nwho brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nThey control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nThese are -- 10 companies\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\ncontrol much of what's in our grocery stores,\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nmuch of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nSo when I started thinking about these issues\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand how I was going to change what kids ate,\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nI really started focusing on what we would teach them.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nAnd the very first thing\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nwas about regional food -- trying to eat food\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nfrom within our region.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nAnd clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nor when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nas oil hits its peak oil,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:34.958\nyou know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not\n\n00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nwe should, or could, be moving food\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\n1,500 miles before we eat it.\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nSo we talked to kids about that,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand we really start to feed kids regional food.\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nAnd then we talk about organic food.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow, most school districts can't really afford organic food,\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nbut we, as a nation,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nhave to start thinking about\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nconsuming, growing and feeding our children\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nfood that's not chock-full of chemicals.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nWe can't keep feeding our kids pesticides\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nand herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nWe can't keep doing that.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nYou know, it doesn't work.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nAnd the results of that are kids getting sick.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nOne of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nSeventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nis consumed in animal husbandry.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWe are feeding our kids antibiotics\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nin beef and other animal protein every day.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nSeventy percent -- it's unbelievable.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nAnd the result of it is, we have diseases.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nWe have things like E. coli that we can't fix,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthat we can't make kids better when they get sick.\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nAnd, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nbut it's an issue in the food supply.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nOne of my favorite facts is that\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nU.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThat means every one of us, and our children,\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nconsumes what would equal a five-pound bag --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nthose bags you have at home. If I had one here\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nand ripped it open,\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nand that pile I would have on the floor\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nis what we consume and feed our children every year\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nbecause of what goes into our food supply,\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nbecause of the way we consume\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nproduce in America.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nThe USDA allows these antibiotics,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nthese hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nand the USDA paid for this ad\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nin Time magazine.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOkay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nbut we know it wasn't good for you and me.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.958\nAnd that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.\n\n00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nAnd that has to change, you know.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nThe USDA cannot be seen as\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nthe be-all and end-all of what we feed\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nour kids and what's allowed.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nWe cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThe antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nThat's what I really try and get people to understand.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nI really try and teach it to kids.

They go to see Michelangelo's \"David,\" and when they finally come face to face with the statue, they both freeze dead in their tracks. The first guy \u2014 we'll call him Adam \u2014 is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form. The second guy \u2014 we'll call him Bill \u2014 is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring at the thing there in the center. So here's my question for you: which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush, which for Al Gore?I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. We all know that it's Bill. And in this case, the stereotype corresponds to reality. It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel. People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.If you know about this trait, you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read, what kinds of places they like to travel to, and what kinds of food they like to eat. Once you understand this trait, you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's, but not anybody that you know. (Laughter) This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait, Robert McCrae says that, \"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views\" \u2014 they like a society which is open and changing \u2014 \"whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views.\"This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture, who seek a deeper understanding of the world, and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all? This is from some guy named Ted. (Laughter) Well, let's see now, if openness predicts who becomes liberal, and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster, then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal? Let's find out. I'm going to ask you to raise your hand, whether you are liberal, left of center \u2014 on social issues, we're talking about, primarily \u2014 or conservative, and I'll give a third option, because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. So, right now, please raise your hand \u2014 down in the simulcast rooms, too, let's let everybody see who's here \u2014 please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. Please raise your hand high right now. OK. Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. OK, about a \u2014 two dozen. And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. One, two, three, four, five \u2014 about eight or 10.OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking. When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves. (Laughter) We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity. (Laughter) (Applause) So, if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way, then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix, in a particular moral matrix. And by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie \"The Matrix.\"But I'm here today to give you a choice. You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions, or you can take the red pill, learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix. Now, because I know \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 OK, I assume that answers my question. I was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need. You're all high in openness to experience, and besides, it looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures. So anyway, let's go with the red pill. Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.Let's start at the beginning. What is morality and where does it come from? The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds, and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. The best definition of innateness I've ever seen \u2014 this just clarifies so many things for me \u2014 is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. He says, \"The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises. Built-in doesn't mean unmalleable; it means organized in advance of experience.\" OK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind? To find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I read through the literature on anthropology, on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches. What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines? That you find across cultures and even across species? We found five \u2014 five best matches, which we call the five foundations of morality.The first one is harm/care. We're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others, care for others, feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable. It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. This moral foundation underlies about 70 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals, but the evidence for people could not be clearer. This Norman Rockwell painting is called \"The Golden Rule,\" and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course, as the foundation of so many religions. That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED.The third foundation is in-group/loyalty. You do find groups in the animal kingdom \u2014 you do find cooperative groups \u2014 but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate, join together into groups, but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups. This probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology. And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes, we go ahead and make them, because it's fun. (Laughter) Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.The fourth foundation is authority/respect. Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species. But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality, as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference, and even elements of love, at times.The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity. This painting is called \"The Allegory Of Chastity,\" but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body. And while the political right may moralize sex much more, the political left is really doing a lot of it with food. Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays, and a lot of it is ideas about purity, about what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. I think this is what we come with, at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town, how is this first draft going to get revised? And how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia? To think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor. If there really are five systems at work in the mind \u2014 five sources of intuitions and emotions \u2014 then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels, where you can set it to a different setting on every channel. And my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I, made a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. And so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too. Here are the results. Here are the results from about 23,000 American citizens. On the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals; on the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates. The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions.So, as you see, people care about harm and care issues. They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board, but as you also see, liberals care about it a little more than conservatives \u2014 the line slopes down. Same story for fairness. But look at the other three lines. For liberals, the scores are very low. Liberals are basically saying, \"No, this is not morality. In-group, authority, purity \u2014 this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.\" But as people get more conservative, the values rise. We can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel, or two-foundation morality. Conservatives have more of a five-foundation, or five-channel morality.We find this in every country we look at. Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians. I'll just flip through a few other slides. The U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia. Notice also that on all of these graphs, the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity. Which shows that within any country, the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness. Everybody \u2014 I mean, we debate over what's fair \u2014 but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter. Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. In one recent study, we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. You picked a particular breed, you learned some new information about the breed. Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded, and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal? Well, if you are a liberal, you say, \"Hey, that's great!\" Because liberals like to say, \"Fetch, please.\" (Laughter) But if you're conservative, that's not so attractive. If you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers, for conservatives, well, loyalty is good \u2014 dogs ought to be loyal. But to a liberal, it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination. (Laughter)So, you might say, OK, there are these differences between liberals and conservatives, but what makes those three other foundations moral? Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism? What makes them moral? The answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch, \"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\" In the first panel, we see the moment of creation. All is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be. But then, given the way of the world, things change. We get every person doing whatever he wants, with every aperture of every other person and every other animal. Some of you might recognize this as the '60s. (Laughter) But the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s, where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. Of course, Bosch called this hell.So this triptych, these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. The truth of social entropy. But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure, here's the same story, the same progression, told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago, in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. A game in which you give people money, and then, on each round of the game, they can put money into a common pot, and then the experimenter doubles what's in there, and then it's all divided among the players. So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues, where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. But you really want everybody else to sacrifice, but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. And what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative \u2014 and this is all played anonymously. On the first round, people give about half of the money that they can. But they quickly see, \"You know what, other people aren't doing so much though. I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.\" And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.But then \u2014 and here's the trick \u2014 Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people, \"You know what? New rule. If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that.\" And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on, cooperation shoots up. It shoots up and it keeps going up. There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps. It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip, you need some sort of punishment to bring people, when they're in large groups, to cooperate. There's even some recent research suggesting that religion \u2014 priming God, making people think about God \u2014 often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere, in part for the purpose of trusting each other, and then being more effective at competing with other groups. I think that's probably right, although this is a controversial issue. But I'm particularly interested in religion, and the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us. Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is really simple. It's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time, and you get the Grand Canyon. It's not that complicated. This is what's really complicated, that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon, cooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa, or on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan. How did this happen? This is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.The answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes, you do need to be concerned about harm, you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups, and if those sub-groups have some internal structure, and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say \"No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership.\" They say, \"Let's question authority.\" And they say, \"Keep your laws off my body.\"Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive, and restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says, \"Stop bitching, start a revolution.\" If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good, it's change, it's fun. Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions. They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said, \"The restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.\" This was after the chaos of the French Revolution. So once you see this \u2014 once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute, that they form a balance on change versus stability \u2014 then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained. Think about yin and yang. Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. Yin and yang are both necessary, like night and day, for the functioning of the world. You find the same thing in Hinduism. There are many high gods in Hinduism. Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. You have the markings of Vishnu on the left, so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva on the right, Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together. You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. From the Zen master Seng-ts'an: \"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.\" Now unfortunately, it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. But before you feel superior to George Bush, before you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this? Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil? Can you be not for or against anything?So, what's the point? What should you do? Well, if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions, and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology, I think you come to these conclusions: that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. So what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive? Am I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop, stop with this struggle of for and against? No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much, using so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money, to make the world a better place, to fight \u2014 to fight wrongs, to solve problems.But as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in, saying, \"You're wrong, and I'm right.\" Because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are \u2014 understand our moral psychology, understand that we all think we're right \u2014 and then step out, even if it's just for a moment, step out \u2014 check in with Seng-ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix, just try to see it as a struggle playing out, in which everybody does think they're right, and everybody, at least, has some reasons \u2014 even if you disagree with them \u2014 everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility, to get yourself out of this self-righteousness, which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama \u2014 and it comes from his moral humility.So I think the point \u2014 the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED \u2014 is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you.

OK.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nPlease raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nOK, about a -- two dozen.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nAnd please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nOne, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nOK. This is a bit of a problem.\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nBecause if our goal is to understand the world,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nto seek a deeper understanding of the world,\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nour general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nBecause when people all share values, when people all share morals,\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nthey become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nit shuts down open-minded thinking.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nWhen the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nand as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWe try to explain why half of America voted for the other team.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nWe think they must be blinded by religion, or by simple stupidity.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:48.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nSo, if you think that half of America votes Republican\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nbecause they are blinded in this way,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nthen my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nin a particular moral matrix.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nAnd by the matrix, I mean literally the matrix, like the movie \"The Matrix.\"\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nBut I'm here today to give you a choice.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nYou can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nor you can take the red pill,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nlearn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, because I know --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\n(Applause) --\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nOK, I assume that answers my question.\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nI was going to ask you which one you picked, but no need.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nYou're all high in openness to experience, and besides,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nit looks like it might even taste good, and you're all epicures.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nSo anyway, let's go with the red pill.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nLet's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nLet's start at the beginning.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nWhat is morality and where does it come from?\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nThe worst idea in all of psychology\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nis the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nDevelopmental psychology has shown\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nthat kids come into the world already knowing so much\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nabout the physical and social worlds,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nand programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nand hard to learn others.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThe best definition of innateness I've ever seen --\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nthis just clarifies so many things for me --\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nis from the brain scientist Gary Marcus.\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nHe says, \"The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nNature provides a first draft, which experience then revises.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nBuilt-in doesn't mean unmalleable;\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nit means organized in advance of experience.\"\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nOK, so what's on the first draft of the moral mind?\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nTo find out, my colleague, Craig Joseph, and I\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nread through the literature on anthropology,\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.958\non culture variation in morality\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand also on evolutionary psychology, looking for matches.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nWhat are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines?\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThat you find across cultures and even across species?\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nWe found five -- five best matches,\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nwhich we call the five foundations of morality.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.958\nThe first one is harm/care.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nWe're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nthat makes us really bond with others, care for others,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nfeel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nIt gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nThis moral foundation underlies about 70 percent\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThe second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nThere's actually ambiguous evidence\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nas to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nbut the evidence for people could not be clearer.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThis Norman Rockwell painting is called \"The Golden Rule,\"\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nand we heard about this from Karen Armstrong, of course,\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nas the foundation of so many religions.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nThat second foundation underlies the other 30 percent\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nof the moral statements I've heard here at TED.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThe third foundation is in-group/loyalty.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nYou do find groups in the animal kingdom --\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nyou do find cooperative groups --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nbut these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nIt's only among humans that you find very large groups of people\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nwho are able to cooperate, join together into groups,\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nbut in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nThis probably comes from our long history of tribal living, of tribal psychology.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nthat even when we don't have tribes,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nwe go ahead and make them, because it's fun.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSports is to war as pornography is to sex.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nWe get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nThe fourth foundation is authority/respect.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nHere you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:01.958\nBut authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality,\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nas it is in other primates.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nIt's based on more voluntary deference,\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand even elements of love, at times.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nThe fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis painting is called \"The Allegory Of Chastity,\"\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nbut purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nIt's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthat tells you that you can attain virtue\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nby controlling what you do with your body,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nby controlling what you put into your body.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nAnd while the political right may moralize sex much more,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nthe political left is really doing a lot of it with food.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nFood is becoming extremely moralized nowadays,\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nand a lot of it is ideas about purity,\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nabout what you're willing to touch, or put into your body.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nI believe these are the five best candidates\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nfor what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI think this is what we come with, at least\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\na preparedness to learn all of these things.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nBut as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town,\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nhow is this first draft going to get revised?\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nAnd how will it end up being different\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nfrom a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nTo think about culture variation, let's try a different metaphor.\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nIf there really are five systems at work in the mind --\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nfive sources of intuitions and emotions --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthen we can think of the moral mind\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nas being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nwhere you can set it to a different setting on every channel.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nAnd my colleagues, Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham, and I,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nmade a questionnaire, which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nAnd so far, 30,000 people have taken this questionnaire, and you can too.\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nHere are the results.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nHere are the results from about 23,000 American citizens.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nOn the left, I've plotted the scores for liberals;\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\non the right, those for conservatives; in the middle, the moderates.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nThe blue line shows you people's responses\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\non the average of all the harm questions.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nSo, as you see, people care about harm and care issues.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nThey give high endorsement of these sorts of statements\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nall across the board, but as you also see,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nliberals care about it a little more than conservatives -- the line slopes down.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nSame story for fairness.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nBut look at the other three lines.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nFor liberals, the scores are very low.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nLiberals are basically saying, \"No, this is not morality.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nIn-group, authority, purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.\"\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nBut as people get more conservative, the values rise.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nWe can say that liberals have a kind of a two-channel,\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nor two-foundation morality.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nConservatives have more of a five-foundation,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nor five-channel morality.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nWe find this in every country we look at.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nHere's the data for 1,100 Canadians.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nI'll just flip through a few other slides.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nLatin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nNotice also that on all of these graphs,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nthe slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nWhich shows that within any country,\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthe disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nEverybody -- I mean, we debate over what's fair --\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nbut everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nMoral arguments within cultures\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nare especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nThis effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nIn one recent study,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nwe asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nYou picked a particular breed,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nyou learned some new information about the breed.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nSuppose you learn that this particular breed is independent-minded,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nand relates to its owner as a friend and an equal?\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nWell, if you are a liberal, you say, \"Hey, that's great!\"\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nBecause liberals like to say, \"Fetch, please.\"\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:00.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut if you're conservative, that's not so attractive.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nIf you're conservative, and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nto its home and family, and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers,\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nfor conservatives, well, loyalty is good -- dogs ought to be loyal.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nBut to a liberal, it sounds like this dog\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nis running for the Republican nomination.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:17.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nSo, you might say, OK,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthere are these differences between liberals and conservatives,\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nbut what makes those three other foundations moral?\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nAren't those just the foundations of xenophobia\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand authoritarianism and Puritanism?\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nWhat makes them moral?\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThe answer, I think, is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch,\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\n\"The Garden of Earthly Delights.\"\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nIn the first panel, we see the moment of creation.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAll is ordered, all is beautiful, all the people and animals\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nare doing what they're supposed to be doing, where they're supposed to be.\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nBut then, given the way of the world, things change.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWe get every person doing whatever he wants,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nwith every aperture of every other person and every other animal.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nSome of you might recognize this as the '60s.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:54.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nBut the '60s inevitably gives way to the '70s,\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nwhere the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nOf course, Bosch called this hell.\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nSo this triptych, these three panels\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nportray the timeless truth that order tends to decay.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nThe truth of social entropy.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nBut lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nwhere Christians have this weird problem with pleasure,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nhere's the same story, the same progression,\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\ntold in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nin which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nA game in which you give people money,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nand then, on each round of the game,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nthey can put money into a common pot,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand then the experimenter doubles what's in there,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nand then it's all divided among the players.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nwhere we're asking people to make a sacrifice\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nand they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nBut you really want everybody else to sacrifice,\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nbut everybody has a temptation to a free ride.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd what happens is that, at first, people start off reasonably cooperative --\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nand this is all played anonymously.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nOn the first round, people give about half of the money that they can.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nBut they quickly see, \"You know what, other people aren't doing so much though.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nI don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.\"\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nAnd so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good, down to close to zero.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nBut then -- and here's the trick --\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nFehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\n\"You know what? New rule.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nIf you want to give some of your own money\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:20.958\nto punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that.\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nAnd as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on,\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\ncooperation shoots up.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nIt shoots up and it keeps going up.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nThere's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nIt's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nIt really helps to have some sort of punishment.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nEven if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nyou need some sort of punishment to bring people,\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nwhen they're in large groups, to cooperate.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThere's even some recent research suggesting that religion --\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:46.958\npriming God, making people think about God --\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:51.958\noften, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nSome people think that religion is an adaptation\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nevolved both by cultural and biological evolution\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\nto make groups to cohere,\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nin part for the purpose of trusting each other,\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nand then being more effective at competing with other groups.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nI think that's probably right,\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nalthough this is a controversial issue.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nBut I'm particularly interested in religion,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand the origin of religion, and in what it does to us and for us.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBecause I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nThe Grand Canyon is really simple.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nIt's just a lot of rock, and then a lot of water and wind, and a lot of time,\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.958\nand you get the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nIt's not that complicated.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThis is what's really complicated,\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\ncooperating with each other, or on the savannahs of Africa,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.958\nor on the frozen shores of Alaska, and then some of these villages\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:35.958\ngrew into the mighty cities of Babylon, and Rome, and Tenochtitlan.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nHow did this happen?\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nThis is an absolute miracle, much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nThe answer, I think, is that they used every tool in the toolbox.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nIt took all of our moral psychology\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nto create these cooperative groups.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nYes, you do need to be concerned about harm,\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nyou do need a psychology of justice.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nBut it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nand if those sub-groups have some internal structure,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand if you have some ideology that tells people\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nto suppress their carnality, to pursue higher, nobler ends.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nAnd now we get to the crux of the disagreement\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nbetween liberals and conservatives.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nBecause liberals reject three of these foundations.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThey say \"No, let's celebrate diversity, not common in-group membership.\"\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nThey say, \"Let's question authority.\"\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd they say, \"Keep your laws off my body.\"\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nLiberals have very noble motives for doing this.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nTraditional authority, traditional morality can be quite repressive,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.958\nand restrictive to those at the bottom, to women, to people that don't fit in.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nSo liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nThey want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nThis guy's shirt says, \"Stop bitching, start a revolution.\"\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIf you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nit's change, it's fun.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nConservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nThey want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThe great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nIt's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nSo as Edmund Burke said, \"The restraints on men,\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nas well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights.\"\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThis was after the chaos of the French Revolution.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nSo once you see this -- once you see\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nthat liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nthat they form a balance on change versus stability --\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthen I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nThis is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nThink about yin and yang.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nYin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nYin and yang are both necessary, like night and day,\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nfor the functioning of the world.\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nYou find the same thing in Hinduism.\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThere are many high gods in Hinduism.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nTwo of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nThis image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body.\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nYou have the markings of Vishnu on the left,\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nso we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nYou have the markings of Shiva on the right,\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nShiva's the liberal god. And they work together.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nYou find the same thing in Buddhism.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nThese two stanzas contain, I think, the deepest insights\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nthat have ever been attained into moral psychology.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nFrom the Zen master Seng-ts'an:\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:49.958\n\"If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nThe struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.\"\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nNow unfortunately, it's a disease\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nthat has been caught by many of the world's leaders.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nBut before you feel superior to George Bush,\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nbefore you throw a stone, ask yourself, do you accept this?\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nDo you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nCan you be not for or against anything?\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nSo, what's the point? What should you do?\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nWell, if you take the greatest insights\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nfrom ancient Asian philosophies and religions,\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nand you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology,\n\n00:16:20.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nI think you come to these conclusions:\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nthat our righteous minds were designed by evolution\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nto unite us into teams, to divide us against other teams\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:31.958\nand then to blind us to the truth.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nSo what should you do? Am I telling you to not strive?\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nAm I telling you to embrace Seng-ts'an and stop,\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nstop with this struggle of for and against?\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nNo, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:47.958\nThis is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nusing so much of their talent, their brilliance, their energy, their money,\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nto make the world a better place, to fight --\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nto fight wrongs, to solve problems.\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nBut as we learned from Samantha Power, in her story\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nabout Sergio Vieira de Mello, you can't just go charging in,\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nsaying, \"You're wrong, and I'm right.\"\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nBecause, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nA lot of the problems we have to solve\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nare problems that require us to change other people.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nAnd if you want to change other people, a much better way to do it\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nis to first understand who we are -- understand our moral psychology,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nunderstand that we all think we're right -- and then step out,\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:31.958\neven if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Seng-ts'an.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nStep out of the moral matrix,\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\njust try to see it as a struggle playing out,\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nin which everybody does think they're right,\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:39.958\nand everybody, at least, has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them --\n\n00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.958\neverybody has some reasons for what they're doing.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:42.958\nStep out.\n\n00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nto get yourself out of this self-righteousness,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nwhich is the normal human condition.\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nThink about the Dalai Lama.\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nThink about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama --\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nand it comes from his moral humility.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nSo I think the point -- the point of my talk,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.958\nand I think the point of TED --\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:06.958\nis that this is a group that is passionately engaged\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nin the pursuit of changing the world for the better.\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nPeople here are passionately engaged\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nin trying to make the world a better place.\n\n00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nBut there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nAnd so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nto the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:25.958\nThank you.\n\n00:18:25.958 --> 00:18:28.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "What security means to me", "duration": "825", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/eve_ensler_on_security", "transcript": "I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. I began \"The Vagina Monologues\" because I was worried about vaginas. I'm very worried today about this notion, this world, this prevailing kind of force of security. I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere. Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance. Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure? What does anyone mean when they talk about real security? And why have we, as Americans particularly, become a nation that strives for security above all else? In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure. And that's actually the good news.This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure. I think that when that is the focus of your life, these are the things that happen. You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle. You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time, as they might confuse you or challenge you. You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people, new ways of doing things \u2014 they might take you off course. You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity. You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew. You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American. You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex. Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself. You become part of an \"us.\" In order to be secure, you defend against \"them.\" You cling to your land because it is your secure place. You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. You become your nation. You become your religion. You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you and protect you from doubt or change. But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind. In reality, it does not really make you safer.I was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami, and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes, a 30-foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people, a population and lives. All this striving for security, in fact, has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time. There are people not like you \u2014 people who you now call enemies. You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think, worlds that you can no longer inhabit. And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. This becomes your mission. That is all you do. Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us. It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them. It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them, occupy them, invade them and kill them, because they are only obstacles now to your security. In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day, a global movement against [violence against] women, to travel probably to 60 countries, and spend a great deal of time in different portions. I've met women and men all over this planet, who through various circumstances \u2014 war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence \u2014 have never known security, or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban, who were essentially brutalized and censored. I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped, or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world. I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world, we call Vagina Warriors. These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s, or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes, in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss. They have grieved it, they have died into it, and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine. They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory.These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. I venture there are many in this room. They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. Their own personal security is not their end goal, and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security, because the transformation of suffering is their end goal, I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security. I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo, and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized. And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. Women in Uganda this year, who put on \"The Vagina Monologues\" during V-Day, actually evoked the wrath of the government.And, I love this story so much. There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether \"Vaginas\" could come to Uganda. And in this meeting \u2014 it went on for weeks in the press, two weeks where there was huge discussion. The government finally made a decision that \"The Vagina Monologues\" could not be performed in Uganda. But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women, and because they had been willing to risk their security, it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda, but all of Africa. As a result, this production, which had already sold out, every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people, made a decision to keep the money. They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. She's a high school student. She had seen \"The Vagina Monologues\" and she was really moved. And as a result, she wore an \"I heart my vagina\" button to her high school in Minnesota.(Laughter)She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school, that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing, that it was not a good thing. So she really struggled with this, what to do, because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together \u2014 I believe it was 100, 150 students all wore \"I love my vagina\" T-shirts, and the boys wore \"I love her vagina\" T-shirts to school.(Laughter)Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous, but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex, it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.I know I've talked about Agnes here before, but I want to give you an update on Agnes. I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley. When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will. That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating. She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard, but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley. She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso, and she would teach people, everywhere she went, what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers. She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her and she said, \"Well, if you got me a Jeep, I could get around a lot faster.\" So, we bought her a Jeep. In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut. So, we said, what else could we do? She said, \"If you help me get money, I could open a house.\" Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled, she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community. I am proud to tell you that six months ago, she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.(Applause)I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure. Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist. Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow. Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it. Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs. It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended, and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present.Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost. I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa, and I had no idea where I was. I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from, and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack. And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going, or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. All of us are refugees. We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time, moving towards a new place. Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group, but that I can visit and find myself in every group. It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs, but it does mean I am not hardened around them. I do not use them as weapons. In the shared future, it will be just that, shared. The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable, realizing the place of our connection to one another, rather than becoming secure, in control and alone. Thank you very much.(Applause)Chris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted? On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom? Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century, we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time. And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping, and then moving on, I'm fine. When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me, and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble. Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place, country to country, and city to city, the degree to which women, for example, are violated, and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it, is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time, or I have to take the time now, to process that.CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about, you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. Why this one? EE: I think that if you think about women, women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth, we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries, they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime, we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet, we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting. Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future, or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women, it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.", "id": 217, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nI think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nthat I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.\n\n00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nI began \"The Vagina Monologues\" because I was worried about vaginas.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nI'm very worried today about this notion, this world,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nthis prevailing kind of force of security.\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nReal security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nWhy has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nWhat does anyone mean when they talk about real security?\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nAnd why have we, as Americans particularly,\n\n00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nbecome a nation that strives for security above all else?\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nIn fact, I think that security is elusive.

You become your religion.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nYou become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nand protect you from doubt or change.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nBut all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nIn reality, it does not really make you safer.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nI was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nand I was standing on the beaches\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\na 30-foot wave could rise up\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand desecrate a people, a population and lives.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAll this striving for security, in fact,\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nhas made you much more insecure\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nbecause now you have to watch out all the time.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nThere are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nYou have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nworlds that you can no longer inhabit.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nAnd so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nYour days become devoted to protecting yourself.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nThis becomes your mission. That is all you do.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nIdeas get shorter. They become sound bytes.\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nThere are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nThere are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nIt gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nIt gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.958\noccupy them, invade them and kill them,\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nbecause they are only obstacles now to your security.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIn six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:24.958\na global movement against [violence against] women,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.958\nto travel probably to 60 countries,\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nand spend a great deal of time in different portions.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nI've met women and men all over this planet,\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nwho through various circumstances --\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nwar, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence --\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nhave never known security,\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nor have had their illusion of security forever devastated.\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nI've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwho were essentially brutalized and censored.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.958\nI've been in Bosnian refugee camps.\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nI was with women in Pakistan\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nwho have had their faces melted off with acid.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nI've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nor raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nOne of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nis that there is this emerging species.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nI loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nI've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwe call Vagina Warriors.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nThese particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nor weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nin the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nThey have grieved it, they have died into it,\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nand allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nThey have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\ntowards another mission and another trajectory.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nThese warriors now devote themselves and their lives\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nto making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThere are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nI venture there are many in this room.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nThey have a fierceness and a freedom\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nthat I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nThey have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nTheir own personal security is not their end goal,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nand because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nbecause the transformation of suffering is their end goal,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nI actually believe they are creating real safety\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand a whole new idea of security.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nI want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nTomorrow, I am going to Cairo,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nand I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nwho are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nfor battered women in the Middle East.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nThat will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\nand put themselves on the line,\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nand talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nand were willing to be attacked and criticized.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nAnd through their work over the last years,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nthis is not only happening that this house is opening,\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nbut it's being supported by many factions of the society\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nwho never would have supported it.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nWomen in Uganda this year,\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwho put on \"The Vagina Monologues\" during V-Day,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nactually evoked the wrath of the government.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd, I love this story so much.\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nThere was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nto talk about whether \"Vaginas\" could come to Uganda.\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nAnd in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press,\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ntwo weeks where there was huge discussion.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nThe government finally made a decision\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat \"The Vagina Monologues\" could not be performed in Uganda.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nBut the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nand because they had been willing to risk their security,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nit began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nbut all of Africa.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nAs a result, this production, which had already sold out,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nevery single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nmade a decision to keep the money.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nThey raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nThere's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nShe's a high school student.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nShe had seen \"The Vagina Monologues\" and she was really moved. And as a result,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nshe wore an \"I heart my vagina\" button to her high school in Minnesota.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nShe was basically threatened to be expelled from school.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nThey told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nthat it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nthat it was not a good thing.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nSo she really struggled with this, what to do,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nbecause she was a senior and she was doing well in her school\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nand she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together --\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nI believe it was 100, 150 students\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nall wore \"I love my vagina\" T-shirts,\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nand the boys wore \"I love her vagina\" T-shirts to school.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nNow this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nbut what happened as a result of that, is that that school now\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nis forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nit's beginning to look at why it would be wrong\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nfor a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nor to say that she loved her vagina publicly.\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI know I've talked about Agnes here before,\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nbut I want to give you an update on Agnes.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nI met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nWhen she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThat mutilation of her clitoris\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nhad actually obviously impacted her life\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand changed it in a way that was devastating.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nShe made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nbut to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nFor eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nShe had this amazing box that she carried and it had a\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\ntorso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nand she would teach people, everywhere she went,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwhat a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nIn the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nShe saved 1,500 girls from being cut.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWhen V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand she said, \"Well, if you got me a Jeep,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nI could get around a lot faster.\" So, we bought her a Jeep.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nIn the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nSo, we said, what else could we do?\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nShe said, \"If you help me get money, I could open a house.\"\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nThree years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWhen she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nshe was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nI am proud to tell you that six months ago,\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nshe was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:36.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nI think what I'm trying to say here\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nis that if your end goal is security,\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nand if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nis that you create not only more insecurity in other people,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbut you make yourself far more insecure.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nReal security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nNot running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nReal security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nReal security is hungering for connection rather than power.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nIt cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nthat we are all utterly inter-bended,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand one action by one being in one tiny town\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nhas consequences everywhere.\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\nReal security is not only being able\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nto tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand only trusting a situation when they are present.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSomething happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nI remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nand I had no idea where I was.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nI didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nAnd then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nwhere I was going, or where I had come from\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nbecause we are all essentially permanently displaced people.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nAll of us are refugees.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nWe come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nmoving towards a new place.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nFreedom means I may not be identified as any one group,\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nbut that I can visit and find myself in every group.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nIt does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nbut it does mean I am not hardened around them.\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nI do not use them as weapons.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nIn the shared future, it will be just that, shared.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThe end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nrealizing the place of our connection to one another,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nrather than becoming secure, in control and alone.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nChris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nOn a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nEve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nthat in order to survive the twentieth century,\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nwe have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd I think part of what I'm learning in this process\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nis that one must allow oneself to feel grief.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nAnd I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nand then moving on, I'm fine.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nWhen I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nand isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nBecause when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.958\ncountry to country, and city to city,\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nthe degree to which women, for example, are violated,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nand the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nis so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nor I have to take the time now, to process that.\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nCA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nyou know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nWhy this one?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nEE: I think that if you think about women,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwomen are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwe come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthey are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nthat one out of three women on the planet\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nwill be raped or beaten in their lifetime,\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwe're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nwe're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nImagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nHow does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nor thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nif we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nit would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself."}, {"title": "How to pitch to a VC", "duration": "879", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_s_rose_on_pitching_to_vcs", "transcript": "Good morning. My name is David Rose. I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs, I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches. And turning to the other side of the equation, I've personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have pitched me with PowerPoint presentations. So I think it's safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitching.So, the very first question you've got to figure out is: What is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea? There are obviously all kinds of things \u2014 business models and financials and markets and this and that. Overall, of all the things that you have to do, what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in? Somebody? What?Audience: People!David Rose: People! You! That's it \u2014 you are the person. Therefore, the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return.Now, how do you do this? You can't just walk up and say, \"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl, and you should invest in me.\" Right? So in the course of your VC pitch \u2014 you have a very few minutes; most VC pitches, angel pitches, are about 15 minutes, most should be less than half an hour \u2014 people's attention span, after 18 minutes, begins to drop off. Tests have shown. So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes, you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics, about 10 different characteristics, while you're standing up there. What's the single most important thing you've got to convey? What?Audience: Integrity.DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy! That's a straight line, look at that! And I didn't even prompt him. Right, integrity. The key thing. I would much rather invest in, take a chance on, somebody who I know is straight than where there's any possible question of who are they looking out for, and what's going on. So the most important thing is integrity. What's the second most important thing? Let's see if you can get this one.Audience: Self-confidence.DR: Close enough. Passion. Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who are leaving something else, starting a new world, creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing. You've got to convey passion. If you're not passionate, why should anyone else be, or put money into your company if you're not passionate about it? Integrity, passion: the most important things.Then there's a whole panoply of other things you've got to wrap up in this package you're presenting to a VC. Experience: you've got to be able to say, \"Hey, you know, I've done this before.\" \"Done this before\" is starting an enterprise, creating value, and taking something from beginning to end. That's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs \u2014 even if you didn't do it right the first time, you've learned the lessons, which puts you in good stead the next time.Along with the experience of starting an enterprise or running something \u2014 doesn't have to be a business, it can be an organization in a school, a not-for-profit. But experience in creating an organization.Next: knowledge. If you tell me you're going to be the developer of the map of the human genome, you better know what a human genome is; I want you to have expertise. I don't want somebody who says, \"I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. I don't know who the players are, what the market is like.\" You've got to know your market, your area.And you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. Those skills include everything from technical skills if it's a technology business, to marketing and sales and management and so on. But, you know, not everybody has all these skills. Very few people have the full set of skills it takes to run a company.What else do you require? Well, leadership. You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it, or else you can. And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead, to inspire them, to motivate them to be part of your team.Having done all that, what else do I want to know as a VC? I want to know that you have commitment. That you are going to be here to the end. I want you to say \u2014 or I want you to convey \u2014 that you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath, your fingernails scratching as they draw you out. You'll keep my money alive and make more from it. I don't want someone who'll cut and run at the first opportunity. Bad things happen. There's never been a venture-funded company where bad things didn't happen. So know that you're committed to the very end.You've got to have vision to see where this is going. I don't want another \"me too\" product. I want somebody who can change the world out there. But on top of that, I need realism, Because while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen. And before you get to change the world, bad things are going to take place; you have to deal with that. And you have to have rational projections.Finally, you're asking for my money \u2014 not just because it's my money, but because it's me. You need to be coachable. I need to know you have the ability to listen. We've had a lot of experience. People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience, and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience.So how do you convey these 10 things in 10 minutes without saying them? You can't say, \"I've got integrity, invest in me!\" You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it. Think about your pitch as a timeline. It starts off, you walk in the door. They know nothing whatsoever about you. You can take them on an emotional \u2014 all pitches, all sales presentations, are emotional at some level. You can go up, you can go down, right? And it goes from beginning to end.You walk in, the first thing you've got to do, the overall arc of your presentation, it's got to start like a rocket. You've got maybe 10 seconds \u2014 between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on how long the pitch is \u2014 to get their attention. In my case, I've invested. I've gotten millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches. \"I've invested millions.\" That should get you right there. This can be a fact or something counterintuitive. It can be a story or an experience. But you've got to grab their emotional attention, focused on you, within that first few seconds. And then from there, you've got to take them on a very solid, steady, upward path, right from beginning to end. Everything has to reinforce this.And you've got to get better and better and better, revving up to the very end, then you've got to \u2014 boom! \u2014 knock them out of the park. You want to get them to such an emotional high they're ready to write you a check, throw money at you, before you leave.How do you do that? First of all, logical progression. Any time you go backwards, any time you skip a step \u2014 imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing, or the heights are different. You stop, you need to figure out a nice, logical progression. Start with what the market is: Why are you going to do X, Y or Z? And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it, and what you're going to do. And it's got to flow from beginning to end.You've got to let me know there are touchstones, to tie in to the rest of the world out there. For example, reference companies I've heard of, or basic items in your business. I want to know about things that I can relate to: validators, or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this, or there's outside validation. It can be sales; it can be you got an award for something; it can be people have done it before; it can be your beta tests are going great, whatever. I want to know validation \u2014 not just what you're telling me, but that somebody or something else out there says this makes sense. And then, I'm looking for the upside; I need a believable upside. That's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable. The upside means if you tell me that five years out, you're making a million dollars a year, that's not really upside. Telling me you'll be making a billion dollars a year \u2014 that's not believable. So it's got to be both.On the other hand are things that take the emotional level down. You have to recover from those. For example, anything that I know is not true. \"We have no competition. Nobody makes a widget like this.\" Odds are I know somebody who's made a widget, and the minute you tell me that, I discount half of what you're saying from then on. Anything I don't understand, where I have to make the leap myself, in my own head, will stop the flow of the presentation. So you've got to take me through like a sixth-grader \u2014 dub, dub, dub \u2014 but without patronizing me. And it's a very tricky path. But if you can do it, it works really well.Anything that's inconsistent within your concept \u2014 if you tell me sales of X, Y or Z are 10 million dollars, five slides later, they're five million dollars ... One may have been gross sales, one may have been net sales, but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together.And then, finally: anything that's an error or a typo, or a stupid mistake or a line that's in the wrong place \u2014 that shows me that if you can't do a presentation, how can you run a company? So this all feeds in together.The best way to do this is to look at our betters, people who have done this before. Let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business, and see how a presentation goes. Bill Gates's PowerPoint presentation over here. Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows. Is this how to do a PowerPoint presentation? What do you think? No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model?Oh, isn't that funny! There's another great one over here. OK, Steve Jobs. You want absolute \u2014 this is the Zen of presentation, right? Here he is, one little guy, black jeans and stuff, on a totally empty stage. What are you focusing on? You're focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.So are these wonderful long bullet points, whole list of things good? No, they're not. The long bullet points are bad. What's good? Short. Short bullet points. But you know what? Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. Just give me the headline. And you know what? How many bullet points does Steve Jobs use? Basically, none. What do you do? Best of all, images. Just a simple image. I look at the image; a picture's worth a thousand words. You look at the image and you've got the whole thing. Then you come back to me; you're focused on me, why I'm such a great guy, why you want to invest, why this all makes sense.That said, we only have a very short time, so let's run through the things to include in your presentation. First of all, none of these big, long-titled slides with blah, blah, I'm presenting to so-and-so on X date. I know the day, I know who I am \u2014 I don't need all that. Just give me your company logo. I look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain. Then I come back to you. I'm focused on you, OK? You give me your quick, 15-second or 30-second intro, grab my attention. Then you give me a quick business overview. This is not a five-minute pitch. This is, you know, two sentences. \"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market.\" Or, \"We sell services to help do X.\" You know, whatever. And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box. That lets me know the context. It gives me the armature for the whole thing you'll be going through; it lets me put everything in relation to what you've told me.Then you've got to walk me through, show me who your management team is. I want to know the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at? I want to know your product, that's very important. Now, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch. I don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it? If it's a website, show me a screenshot of your website. Don't do a live demo. Never do a live demo. Do a canned demo, or something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is.Now that I know what you're selling, tell me how you make money on it. For every X you sell, you get Y, or services of Z. I want to know what the business model is on a per-unit basis, or for the actual product you're selling. I want to know who you're selling to in terms of customers and if you have any special relationships that will help you, whether it's a distribution relationship or a producing partner. Again, validation. This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here.But everybody has competition. There's never been a company with no competition, even if the competition is the old way of doing something. I want to know exactly what your competition is, and that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation. I want to know how you're special.I know what your competition does \u2014 how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch? All this ties into the financial overview. And you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials. I want to know a year or two back, or as long as you've been in existence. And I want to know four or five years forward. Five is a bit much. Probably four.And I want to know how that business model, on a product basis, will translate into a company model: How many widgets will you sell? You make X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is. We'll have 1,000 customers this year and 10,000 the next, our revenues will do this and that. That gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which I'm investing. And I want to know how the money from me will help you get there. You're going to open an offshore plant in China, you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing, you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.But then comes the ask, where you tell me how much you want. You're looking for 5 million \u2014 at what valuation? Two million? 100,000? What's the money in so far? Who invested? I hope you invested \u2014 if you can't invest in your own thing, why should I? So I like to know if you have friends and family, or angel investors, or more VCs before. What's the capital structure up until this point? Finally, having done all that, you've now told me the whole thing, so now you bring it back to that conclusion. This is that rocket going up. Hopefully everything has been positive. And everything you say clicks, it all makes sense. And I'm thinking, \"This is really great!\"Then you take me back to just your logo on the screen. And I look at the logo \u2014 OK, good. Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at, right? Now you've got to wrap it up to give me the final \u2014 boom! \u2014 the final pitch that's going to send me into space. Now, in the process of doing this, how do you remember the sequences and do it? You've noticed I'm not looking at the screen, right? The screen is in front of me, so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.So how do I know what's going on? Well, I have a laptop in front of me. You're looking at me and at this. What am I looking at? You think that I'm looking at that? No, I'm looking, actually, at a special version of PowerPoint over here, which shows me the slides ahead and behind, my notes, so I can see what's going on. PowerPoint has this built into every copy of it that's shipped. If you use Apple's Keynote, it's got an even better version. There's another program called Ovation you can get from Adobe that they bought last summer, which helps you run the timers and lets you figure out what's going on.So, here's my wrap-up to take you to the moon, right? I usually do a Top 10, but we don't have time, so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips. Number five: always use presenter mode, or Ovation, or presenter tools. It lets you know exactly where you're going, helps you pace yourself, gives you a timer, the whole bit.Number four: always use remote control. Have you seen me touch the computer? No. Why not? Because I'm using remote control. Always use remote control.Number three: the handouts you give are not your presentation. If you follow my suggestions, you'll have a very spare, Zen-like presentation, which is great to convey who you are and get people emotionally involved, but not good as a handout. You want a handout that gives more information; it has to stand without you.Number two: don't read your speech. Can you imagine?(Reading) \"You should invest in my company ... \"It doesn't work. And the number one presentation tip: never, ever look at the screen. You're making a connection with your audience, and you always want a one-on-one connection. The screen should come up behind you and supplement what you're doing, instead of replace you. And that is how to pitch to a VC.", "id": 353, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:13.443\nGood morning.\n\n00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:14.727\nMy name is David Rose.\n\n00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:18.307\nI am a serial entrepreneur\nturned serial investor.\n\n00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.927\nAnd by the use of pitching\nPowerPoints to VCs,\n\n00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.427\nI have personally raised\ntens of millions of dollars\n\n00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.321\nfrom VCs through PowerPoint pitches.\n\n00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:29.523\nAnd turning to the other side\nof the equation,\n\n00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:32.963\nI've personally supervised the investment\nof tens of millions of dollars\n\n00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:36.054\ninto companies who have pitched me\nwith PowerPoint presentations.\n\n00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:37.403\nSo I think it's safe to say\n\n00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:40.079\nI know a little bit\nabout the process of pitching.\n\n00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:42.735\nSo, the very first question\nyou've got to figure out is:\n\n00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.417\nWhat is the single most important\nthing that a VC is looking for\n\n00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:49.559\nwhen you come to them\npitching your new business idea?\n\n00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.588\nThere are obviously all kinds of things --\n\n00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:54.494\nbusiness models and financials\nand markets and this and that.\n\n00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:56.724\nOverall, of all the things\nthat you have to do,\n\n00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:58.655\nwhat is the single most important thing\n\n00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.655\nthe VC is going to be investing in?\n\n00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:02.934\nSomebody? What?\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.112\nAudience: People!\n\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.839\nDavid Rose: People! You!\nThat's it -- you are the person.\n\n00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:11.739\nTherefore, the entire purpose\nof a VC pitch is to convince them\n\n00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:15.357\nthat you are the entrepreneur in whom\nthey are going to invest their money\n\n00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:17.271\nand make a lot of money in return.\n\n00:01:17.295 --> 00:01:18.462\nNow, how do you do this?\n\n00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:19.986\nYou can't just walk up and say,\n\n00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.954\n\"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl,\nand you should invest in me.\" Right?\n\n00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:27.552\nSo in the course of your VC pitch --\nyou have a very few minutes;\n\n00:01:27.576 --> 00:01:30.689\nmost VC pitches, angel pitches,\nare about 15 minutes,\n\n00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:33.133\nmost should be less than half an hour --\n\n00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:36.075\npeople's attention span,\nafter 18 minutes, begins to drop off.\n\n00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.250\nTests have shown.\n\n00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:39.469\nSo in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,\n\n00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:42.429\nyou have to convey a whole bunch\nof different characteristics,\n\n00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:44.515\nabout 10 different characteristics,\n\n00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.032\nwhile you're standing up there.\n\n00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:49.670\nWhat's the single most important thing\nyou've got to convey? What?\n\n00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:50.888\nAudience: Integrity.\n\n00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:52.111\nDR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!\n\n00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:53.921\nThat's a straight line, look at that!\n\n00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:55.342\nAnd I didn't even prompt him.\n\n00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.294\nRight, integrity. The key thing.\n\n00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.326\nI would much rather invest in,\ntake a chance on,\n\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.977\nsomebody who I know is straight\nthan where there's any possible question\n\n00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.499\nof who are they looking out for,\nand what's going on.\n\n00:02:06.523 --> 00:02:08.507\nSo the most important thing is integrity.\n\n00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:10.625\nWhat's the second most important thing?\n\n00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.275\nLet's see if you can get this one.\n\n00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.605\nAudience: Self-confidence.\n\n00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.934\nDR: Close enough. Passion.\n\n00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:19.489\nRight? Entrepreneurs, by definition,\nare people who are leaving something else,\n\n00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:23.195\nstarting a new world, creating and putting\ntheir lifeblood into this thing.\n\n00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.604\nYou've got to convey passion.\n\n00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:25.931\nIf you're not passionate,\n\n00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:29.107\nwhy should anyone else be,\nor put money into your company\n\n00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:30.822\nif you're not passionate about it?\n\n00:02:30.846 --> 00:02:33.154\nIntegrity, passion:\nthe most important things.\n\n00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:36.359\nThen there's a whole panoply\nof other things you've got to wrap up\n\n00:02:36.383 --> 00:02:38.573\nin this package you're presenting to a VC.\n\n00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:40.651\nExperience: you've got to be able to say,\n\n00:02:40.675 --> 00:02:42.833\n\"Hey, you know, I've done this before.\"\n\n00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.893\n\"Done this before\" is starting\nan enterprise, creating value,\n\n00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:47.926\nand taking something\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.465\nThat's why VCs love to fund\nserial entrepreneurs --\n\n00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.641\neven if you didn't do it right\nthe first time,\n\n00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:56.004\nyou've learned the lessons, which puts\nyou in good stead the next time.\n\n00:02:56.028 --> 00:02:59.581\nAlong with the experience of starting\nan enterprise or running something --\n\n00:02:59.605 --> 00:03:01.051\ndoesn't have to be a business,\n\n00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:03.781\nit can be an organization\nin a school, a not-for-profit.\n\n00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:05.859\nBut experience\nin creating an organization.\n\n00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:07.034\nNext: knowledge.\n\n00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:08.209\nIf you tell me\n\n00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:11.264\nyou're going to be the developer\nof the map of the human genome,\n\n00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:14.678\nyou better know what a human genome is;\nI want you to have expertise.\n\n00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.187\nI don't want somebody who says,\n\n00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.934\n\"I've got a great idea\nin a business I know nothing about.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.737\nI don't know who the players are,\nwhat the market is like.\"\n\n00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.777\nYou've got to know your market, your area.\n\n00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.904\nAnd you have to have\nthe skills that it takes\n\n00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.078\nto get a company going.\n\n00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.175\nThose skills include\neverything from technical skills\n\n00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.921\nif it's a technology business,\n\n00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:34.719\nto marketing and sales\nand management and so on.\n\n00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:37.425\nBut, you know, not everybody\nhas all these skills.\n\n00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:41.144\nVery few people have the full set\nof skills it takes to run a company.\n\n00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:43.195\nWhat else do you require?\nWell, leadership.\n\n00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:46.725\nYou've got to be able to convince us\nthat you either have developed a team\n\n00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.573\nthat has all those factors\nin it, or else you can.\n\n00:03:49.597 --> 00:03:52.028\nAnd you have the charisma\nand the management style\n\n00:03:52.052 --> 00:03:54.831\nand the ability to get people\nto follow your lead,\n\n00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:58.143\nto inspire them, to motivate them\nto be part of your team.\n\n00:03:58.167 --> 00:03:59.715\nHaving done all that,\n\n00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.460\nwhat else do I want to know as a VC?\n\n00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.579\nI want to know that you have commitment.\n\n00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:05.564\nThat you are going to be here to the end.\n\n00:04:05.588 --> 00:04:08.210\nI want you to say --\nor I want you to convey --\n\n00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:11.858\nthat you are going to die if you\nhave to, with your very last breath,\n\n00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:14.208\nyour fingernails scratching\nas they draw you out.\n\n00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:16.708\nYou'll keep my money alive\nand make more from it.\n\n00:04:16.732 --> 00:04:19.790\nI don't want someone who'll\ncut and run at the first opportunity.\n\n00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:20.965\nBad things happen.\n\n00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.530\nThere's never been a venture-funded\ncompany where bad things didn't happen.\n\n00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:26.699\nSo know that you're committed\nto the very end.\n\n00:04:26.723 --> 00:04:29.319\nYou've got to have vision\nto see where this is going.\n\n00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:31.156\nI don't want another \"me too\" product.\n\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.606\nI want somebody who can\nchange the world out there.\n\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.302\nBut on top of that, I need realism,\n\n00:04:35.326 --> 00:04:39.483\nBecause while changing the world\nis great, it doesn't always happen.\n\n00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:41.436\nAnd before you get to change the world,\n\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.131\nbad things are going to take place;\n\n00:04:43.155 --> 00:04:44.483\nyou have to deal with that.\n\n00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:46.512\nAnd you have to have rational projections.\n\n00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.455\nFinally, you're asking for my money --\n\n00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.913\nnot just because it's my money,\nbut because it's me.\n\n00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:52.133\nYou need to be coachable.\n\n00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:54.308\nI need to know\nyou have the ability to listen.\n\n00:04:54.332 --> 00:04:55.772\nWe've had a lot of experience.\n\n00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.075\nPeople who are VCs or angels\ninvesting in you have had experience,\n\n00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.099\nand they'd like to know that you\nwant to hear that experience.\n\n00:05:02.123 --> 00:05:05.479\nSo how do you convey these 10 things\nin 10 minutes without saying them?\n\n00:05:05.503 --> 00:05:07.878\nYou can't say, \"I've got\nintegrity, invest in me!\"\n\n00:05:07.902 --> 00:05:11.224\nYou've got to do a whole pitch\nthat conveys this without conveying it.\n\n00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:13.015\nThink about your pitch as a timeline.\n\n00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:14.921\nIt starts off, you walk in the door.\n\n00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:16.824\nThey know nothing whatsoever about you.\n\n00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:20.479\nYou can take them on an emotional --\nall pitches, all sales presentations,\n\n00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:21.869\nare emotional at some level.\n\n00:05:21.893 --> 00:05:23.789\nYou can go up, you can go down, right?\n\n00:05:23.813 --> 00:05:25.437\nAnd it goes from beginning to end.\n\n00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:27.611\nYou walk in, the first thing\nyou've got to do,\n\n00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:31.005\nthe overall arc of your presentation,\nit's got to start like a rocket.\n\n00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.764\nYou've got maybe 10 seconds --\n\n00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:35.948\nbetween 10 and 30 seconds,\ndepending on how long the pitch is --\n\n00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:37.496\nto get their attention.\n\n00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.966\nIn my case, I've invested.\n\n00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.784\nI've gotten millions of dollars\nfrom PowerPoint pitches.\n\n00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.667\n\"I've invested millions.\"\nThat should get you right there.\n\n00:05:44.691 --> 00:05:47.005\nThis can be a fact\nor something counterintuitive.\n\n00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.728\nIt can be a story or an experience.\n\n00:05:48.752 --> 00:05:51.836\nBut you've got to grab\ntheir emotional attention, focused on you,\n\n00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.336\nwithin that first few seconds.\n\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.428\nAnd then from there,\nyou've got to take them\n\n00:05:55.452 --> 00:05:59.316\non a very solid, steady, upward path,\nright from beginning to end.\n\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.933\nEverything has to reinforce this.\n\n00:06:00.957 --> 00:06:03.358\nAnd you've got to get better\nand better and better,\n\n00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:04.754\nrevving up to the very end,\n\n00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:06.285\nthen you've got to -- boom! --\n\n00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:07.611\nknock them out of the park.\n\n00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:09.794\nYou want to get them\nto such an emotional high\n\n00:06:09.818 --> 00:06:12.398\nthey're ready to write you a check,\nthrow money at you,\n\n00:06:12.422 --> 00:06:13.573\nbefore you leave.\n\n00:06:13.597 --> 00:06:14.748\nHow do you do that?\n\n00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:16.586\nFirst of all, logical progression.\n\n00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.969\nAny time you go backwards,\nany time you skip a step --\n\n00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:23.195\nimagine walking up a staircase\nwhere some of the treads are missing,\n\n00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:24.935\nor the heights are different.\n\n00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.852\nYou stop, you need to figure out\na nice, logical progression.\n\n00:06:27.876 --> 00:06:31.100\nStart with what the market is:\nWhy are you going to do X, Y or Z?\n\n00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:33.815\nAnd then you've got to tell me\nhow you're going to do it,\n\n00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.364\nand what you're going to do.\n\n00:06:35.388 --> 00:06:37.553\nAnd it's got to flow\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n00:06:37.577 --> 00:06:39.863\nYou've got to let me know\nthere are touchstones,\n\n00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:42.037\nto tie in to the rest\nof the world out there.\n\n00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:45.359\nFor example, reference\ncompanies I've heard of,\n\n00:06:45.383 --> 00:06:47.915\nor basic items in your business.\n\n00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.692\nI want to know about things\nthat I can relate to:\n\n00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:54.413\nvalidators, or anything that tells me\nsomebody else has approved this,\n\n00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:56.140\nor there's outside validation.\n\n00:06:56.164 --> 00:06:59.188\nIt can be sales; it can be\nyou got an award for something;\n\n00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:01.910\nit can be people have done it before;\n\n00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:04.914\nit can be your beta tests\nare going great, whatever.\n\n00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:07.835\nI want to know validation --\nnot just what you're telling me,\n\n00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut that somebody\nor something else out there\n\n00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:11.216\nsays this makes sense.\n\n00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.307\nAnd then, I'm looking for the upside;\nI need a believable upside.\n\n00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:16.957\nThat's two parts; it's got\nto be upside and believable.\n\n00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:19.461\nThe upside means if you tell me\nthat five years out,\n\n00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:22.544\nyou're making a million dollars a year,\nthat's not really upside.\n\n00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.149\nTelling me you'll be making\na billion dollars a year --\n\n00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:26.324\nthat's not believable.\n\n00:07:26.348 --> 00:07:27.499\nSo it's got to be both.\n\n00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:30.544\nOn the other hand are things\nthat take the emotional level down.\n\n00:07:30.568 --> 00:07:32.047\nYou have to recover from those.\n\n00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:34.218\nFor example, anything\nthat I know is not true.\n\n00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:36.966\n\"We have no competition.\nNobody makes a widget like this.\"\n\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.094\nOdds are I know somebody\nwho's made a widget,\n\n00:07:39.118 --> 00:07:40.726\nand the minute you tell me that,\n\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.378\nI discount half of what\nyou're saying from then on.\n\n00:07:43.402 --> 00:07:46.147\nAnything I don't understand,\n\n00:07:46.171 --> 00:07:48.703\nwhere I have to make the leap\nmyself, in my own head,\n\n00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:50.655\nwill stop the flow of the presentation.\n\n00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:53.260\nSo you've got to take me\nthrough like a sixth-grader --\n\n00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:55.347\ndub, dub, dub --\nbut without patronizing me.\n\n00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:56.934\nAnd it's a very tricky path.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.089\nBut if you can do it,\nit works really well.\n\n00:07:59.113 --> 00:08:02.795\nAnything that's inconsistent\nwithin your concept --\n\n00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.495\nif you tell me sales of X, Y or Z\nare 10 million dollars,\n\n00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.953\nfive slides later,\nthey're five million dollars ...\n\n00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:10.761\nOne may have been gross sales,\none may have been net sales,\n\n00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:13.668\nbut I want to know that all the numbers\nmake sense together.\n\n00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:16.231\nAnd then, finally: anything\nthat's an error or a typo,\n\n00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:19.128\nor a stupid mistake or a line\nthat's in the wrong place --\n\n00:08:19.152 --> 00:08:22.781\nthat shows me that if you can't do\na presentation, how can you run a company?\n\n00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:24.677\nSo this all feeds in together.\n\n00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:27.054\nThe best way to do this\nis to look at our betters,\n\n00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:28.673\npeople who have done this before.\n\n00:08:28.697 --> 00:08:32.075\nLet's look at the most successful\ntechnology executive in the business,\n\n00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:33.911\nand see how a presentation goes.\n\n00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:36.569\nBill Gates's PowerPoint\npresentation over here.\n\n00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:38.641\nHere's Gates doing a thing for Windows.\n\n00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:41.791\nIs this how to do a PowerPoint\npresentation? What do you think?\n\n00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:44.498\nNo. Who do you think we should\nlook at as our role model?\n\n00:08:44.522 --> 00:08:47.322\nOh, isn't that funny!\nThere's another great one over here.\n\n00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:48.527\nOK, Steve Jobs.\n\n00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:52.037\nYou want absolute --\nthis is the Zen of presentation, right?\n\n00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:54.847\nHere he is, one little guy,\nblack jeans and stuff,\n\n00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:56.063\non a totally empty stage.\n\n00:08:56.087 --> 00:08:57.665\nWhat are you focusing on?\n\n00:08:57.689 --> 00:08:59.738\nYou're focusing on him!\nThis is Steve Jobs.\n\n00:08:59.762 --> 00:09:03.722\nSo are these wonderful long bullet points,\nwhole list of things good?\n\n00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:06.277\nNo, they're not. The long\nbullet points are bad.\n\n00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.886\nWhat's good? Short. Short bullet points.\n\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.566\nBut you know what? Even better than short\nbullet points are no bullet points.\n\n00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.835\nJust give me the headline.\n\n00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:15.010\nAnd you know what?\n\n00:09:15.034 --> 00:09:17.058\nHow many bullet points\ndoes Steve Jobs use?\n\n00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:18.453\nBasically, none.\n\n00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:19.629\nWhat do you do?\n\n00:09:19.653 --> 00:09:22.489\nBest of all, images. Just a simple image.\n\n00:09:22.513 --> 00:09:25.144\nI look at the image;\na picture's worth a thousand words.\n\n00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.652\nYou look at the image\nand you've got the whole thing.\n\n00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:31.110\nThen you come back to me; you're focused\non me, why I'm such a great guy,\n\n00:09:31.134 --> 00:09:33.444\nwhy you want to invest,\nwhy this all makes sense.\n\n00:09:33.468 --> 00:09:35.559\nThat said, we only have a very short time,\n\n00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:38.621\nso let's run through the things\nto include in your presentation.\n\n00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:41.126\nFirst of all, none of these big,\nlong-titled slides\n\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.729\nwith blah, blah, I'm presenting\nto so-and-so on X date.\n\n00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:46.475\nI know the day, I know who I am --\nI don't need all that.\n\n00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:47.999\nJust give me your company logo.\n\n00:09:48.023 --> 00:09:50.230\nI look at the logo,\nand it ties it to my brain.\n\n00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:53.650\nThen I come back to you.\nI'm focused on you, OK?\n\n00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:57.599\nYou give me your quick, 15-second\nor 30-second intro, grab my attention.\n\n00:09:57.623 --> 00:09:59.628\nThen you give me\na quick business overview.\n\n00:09:59.652 --> 00:10:02.779\nThis is not a five-minute pitch.\nThis is, you know, two sentences.\n\n00:10:02.803 --> 00:10:04.832\n\"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market.\"\n\n00:10:04.856 --> 00:10:07.518\nOr, \"We sell services to help do X.\"\nYou know, whatever.\n\n00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:10.706\nAnd that is like the picture\non the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.\n\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.187\nThat lets me know the context.\n\n00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.463\nIt gives me the armature for the whole\nthing you'll be going through;\n\n00:10:15.487 --> 00:10:18.349\nit lets me put everything\nin relation to what you've told me.\n\n00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:22.655\nThen you've got to walk me through,\nshow me who your management team is.\n\n00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:26.228\nI want to know the size of the market.\nWhy is this market worth getting at?\n\n00:10:26.252 --> 00:10:28.662\nI want to know your product,\nthat's very important.\n\n00:10:28.686 --> 00:10:30.937\nNow, this is not\na product pitch or sales pitch.\n\n00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.154\nI don't want to know all the ins and outs,\njust what the heck is it?\n\n00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:37.240\nIf it's a website, show me\na screenshot of your website.\n\n00:10:37.264 --> 00:10:39.276\nDon't do a live demo.\nNever do a live demo.\n\n00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.550\nDo a canned demo,\nor something that lets me know\n\n00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.732\nwhy people are going\nto buy whatever it is.\n\n00:10:43.756 --> 00:10:45.996\nNow that I know what you're selling,\n\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.595\ntell me how you make money on it.\n\n00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:52.101\nFor every X you sell, you get Y,\nor services of Z.\n\n00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:55.071\nI want to know what the business model\nis on a per-unit basis,\n\n00:10:55.095 --> 00:10:57.055\nor for the actual product you're selling.\n\n00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:59.799\nI want to know who you're selling to\nin terms of customers\n\n00:10:59.823 --> 00:11:02.709\nand if you have any special\nrelationships that will help you,\n\n00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:05.743\nwhether it's a distribution relationship\nor a producing partner.\n\n00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:06.918\nAgain, validation.\n\n00:11:06.942 --> 00:11:10.193\nThis helps to say you're bigger\nthan just one little thing over here.\n\n00:11:10.217 --> 00:11:11.653\nBut everybody has competition.\n\n00:11:11.677 --> 00:11:13.987\nThere's never been a company\nwith no competition,\n\n00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.740\neven if the competition\nis the old way of doing something.\n\n00:11:16.764 --> 00:11:19.044\nI want to know exactly\nwhat your competition is,\n\n00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:22.135\nand that will help me judge\nhow you fit into the whole operation.\n\n00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:23.822\nI want to know how you're special.\n\n00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:25.568\nI know what your competition does --\n\n00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:28.267\nhow are you going to prevent\nthem from eating your lunch?\n\n00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:30.299\nAll this ties into the financial overview.\n\n00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:33.251\nAnd you can't do a VC pitch\nwithout giving me your financials.\n\n00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:36.781\nI want to know a year or two back,\nor as long as you've been in existence.\n\n00:11:36.805 --> 00:11:39.050\nAnd I want to know\nfour or five years forward.\n\n00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.703\nFive is a bit much. Probably four.\n\n00:11:40.727 --> 00:11:43.693\nAnd I want to know how that business\nmodel, on a product basis,\n\n00:11:43.717 --> 00:11:46.921\nwill translate into a company model:\nHow many widgets will you sell?\n\n00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:49.948\nYou make X amount per widget.\nI want to know what the driver is.\n\n00:11:49.972 --> 00:11:52.643\nWe'll have 1,000 customers\nthis year and 10,000 the next,\n\n00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:54.338\nour revenues will do this and that.\n\n00:11:54.362 --> 00:11:57.083\nThat gives me the whole picture\nfor the next several years\n\n00:11:57.107 --> 00:11:58.301\ninto which I'm investing.\n\n00:11:58.325 --> 00:12:01.386\nAnd I want to know how the money\nfrom me will help you get there.\n\n00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.651\nYou're going to open\nan offshore plant in China,\n\n00:12:03.675 --> 00:12:06.114\nyou're going to spend it all\non sales and marketing,\n\n00:12:06.138 --> 00:12:08.001\nyou're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.\n\n00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:10.841\nBut then comes the ask,\nwhere you tell me how much you want.\n\n00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:13.336\nYou're looking for 5 million --\nat what valuation?\n\n00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.570\nTwo million? 100,000?\n\n00:12:15.594 --> 00:12:17.569\nWhat's the money in so far?

They're incredibly complex. They can't \u2014 I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward: it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something. But that's not the hard part.\"So here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is, what do we do about health? The other day, I was reading something, and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West. And there was a little study about people who don't handshake, and comparing them with ones who do handshake. And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake, because they must be hiding. And the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something. Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent. So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth, let's start with that. And since I got that idea, I've had to shake hundreds of hands. And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease, and then you don't have to explain.Education: how do we improve education? Well, the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense. And then, of course, you have to do something about how to moderate that, so that anybody can \u2014 so they'll listen to you. Pollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty. How do we make stable societies? Longevity. Okay, there're lots of problems to worry about.Anyway, the question I think people should talk about \u2014 and it's absolutely taboo \u2014 is, how many people should there be? And I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million. And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear. If you had 100 million people properly spread out, then if there's some garbage, you throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot. Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it. The problem is, how many people should there be? And it's a sort of choice we have to make.Most people are about 60 inches high or more, and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big, by using nanotechnology, I suppose \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 then you could have a thousand times as many. That would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller. Now, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children. And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off. You know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23 from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out, but \u2014 so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage and go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people and you give them a scanner, or whatever you need, and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best, or she \u2014 no reason to have just two sexes any more, even. So each child has 46 parents, and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children. Wouldn't that be enough? And then the children would get plenty of support, and nurturing, and mentoring, and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy.Timesharing is a little further off in the future. And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice, called \"Against the Fall of Night\" and \"The City and the Stars.\" They're both wonderful and largely the same, except that computers happened in between. And Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, \"Well, that was wrong. The future must have some computers.\" So in the second version of it, there are 100 billion or 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies, or whatever they have in the future. And you let a few million of them out at a time. A person comes out, they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back for a billion years \u2014 or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter \u2014 but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. And you get to think about yourself and your memories, and before you go back into suspension, you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth. The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity, so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created. And in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says, maybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system.I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough. I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough. Therefore, we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL. As you remember, at some point in the book for \"2001,\" HAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship, you can see what's written between the lines. Well, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter. I think that we're pretty smart, as compared to chimpanzees, but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face, either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies, or balancing the world around. So one thing we can do is live longer. And nobody knows how hard that is, but we'll probably find out in a few years. You see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost, and nobody lives more than 120 years, for reasons that aren't very well understood. But lots of people now live to 90 or 100, unless they shake hands too much or something like that. And so maybe if we lived 200 years, we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems. So that's one way of going about it. And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be \u2014 after all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee, so we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates, we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees, in the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash, maybe by just a few hundred genes.What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet. And whatever you do, don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime, or something. (Laughter) The stuff has a very short half-life, same with brain science. And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes, we can live 200 years. Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40, and I doubt that it's several hundred. So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists \u2014 you know, an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. (Laughter) And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making, because he says, what about the consequences? And, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones. And yet two random people will mate and have this child, and both of them have some pretty rotten genes, and the child is likely to come out to be average. Which, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed.If we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years, then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years. And so there won't be any workforce. And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have, is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse, because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old. And when I'm talking about a long lifetime, of course, I don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image of what a 200-year-old is \u2014 which is dead, actually.You know, there's about 400 different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions. Nobody knows how most of them work in detail, but we do know that there're lots of different things in there. And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out. And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resources, then, when you're afraid, for example, you may discard your long-range goals, but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal. You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac \u2014 all you care about is not stepping out on that platform. And when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth. So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability. Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove 100 or 200 of your normally available resources.So thinking of emotions as the opposite of \u2014 as something less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope, in the next few years, to show that this will lead to smart machines. And I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. This is a problem of such and such a type, and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem. So I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments, types of situations, types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up. So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian \u2014 we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories, where you say, how do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is, after we go through a lot of levels, including designing a huge, messy system with thousands of ports, we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. Saying, not what are the situations, but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them, how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.So, I think in the next 20 years, if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence, like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say, can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets; we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them. Genetic algorithms are great for certain things; I suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you. (Laughter)Thank you.

They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nBut thinking is really very straightforward:\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nit's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.958\nBut that's not the hard part.\"\n\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nSo here's a list of problems that come up.\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nOne nice problem is, what do we do about health?\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.958\nThe other day, I was reading something, and the person said\n\n00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nprobably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West.\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nAnd there was a little study about people who don't handshake,\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.958\nand comparing them with ones who do handshake.\n\n00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nAnd I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake,\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nbecause they must be hiding.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd the people who avoid that\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nhave 30 percent less infectious disease or something.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nOr maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nSo if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth,\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nlet's start with that. And since I got that idea,\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nI've had to shake hundreds of hands.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I think the only way to avoid it\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nis to have some horrible visible disease,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nand then you don't have to explain.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nEducation: how do we improve education?\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nWell, the single best way is to get them to understand\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nthat what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd then, of course, you have to do something\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nabout how to moderate that, so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nPollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.958\nHow do we make stable societies? Longevity.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nOkay, there're lots of problems to worry about.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnyway, the question I think people should talk about --\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nand it's absolutely taboo -- is, how many people should there be?\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nAnd I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million.\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nAnd then notice that a great many of these problems disappear.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nIf you had 100 million people\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nproperly spread out, then if there's some garbage,\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nyou throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nOr you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nThe problem is, how many people should there be?\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nAnd it's a sort of choice we have to make.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nMost people are about 60 inches high or more,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nand there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big,\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nby using nanotechnology, I suppose --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958\n-- then you could have a thousand times as many.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nThat would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:12.958\ndoing any research on making people smaller.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nNow, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd there's one solution that's probably only a few years off.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nYou know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nfrom each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out,\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nbut -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nand you give them a scanner, or whatever you need,\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nand they look at their chromosomes and each of them says\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nwhich one he likes best, or she -- no reason to have just two sexes\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nany more, even. So each child has 46 parents,\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nand I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nWouldn't that be enough? And then the children\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nwould get plenty of support, and nurturing, and mentoring,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nand the world population would decline very rapidly\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nand everybody would be totally happy.\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nTimesharing is a little further off in the future.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nAnd there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.958\ncalled \"Against the Fall of Night\" and \"The City and the Stars.\"\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nThey're both wonderful and largely the same,\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nexcept that computers happened in between.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, \"Well, that was wrong.\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nThe future must have some computers.\"\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nSo in the second version of it, there are 100 billion\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nor 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nor whatever they have in the future.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd you let a few million of them out at a time.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nA person comes out, they live for a thousand years\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.958\ndoing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nfor a billion years -- or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nbut there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nAnd you get to think about yourself and your memories,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand before you go back into suspension, you edit your memories\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nand you change your personality and so forth.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nThe plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity,\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nso that the people who designed the city\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nmake sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nAnd in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says,\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nmaybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nI don't think the solutions that I proposed\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nare good enough or smart enough.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nI think the big problem is that we're not smart enough\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nto understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nTherefore, we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nAs you remember, at some point in the book for \"2001,\"\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nHAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nfor those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nwith the triviality of the people on the spaceship,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nyou can see what's written between the lines.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nWell, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI think that we're pretty smart, as compared to chimpanzees,\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:38.958\nbut we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face,\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\neither in abstract mathematics\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nor in figuring out economies, or balancing the world around.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nSo one thing we can do is live longer.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nAnd nobody knows how hard that is,\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nbut we'll probably find out in a few years.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nYou see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.958\ntwice as long as chimpanzees almost,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand nobody lives more than 120 years,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nfor reasons that aren't very well understood.\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nBut lots of people now live to 90 or 100,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nunless they shake hands too much or something like that.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nAnd so maybe if we lived 200 years, we could accumulate enough skills\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nand knowledge to solve some problems.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.958\nSo that's one way of going about it.\n\n00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nAnd as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be --\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nafter all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee,\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nso we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthe longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates,\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nwe have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees,\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nin the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nmaybe by just a few hundred genes.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nWhat I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd whatever you do, don't read anything about genetics\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat's published within your lifetime, or something.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nThe stuff has a very short half-life, same with brain science.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nAnd so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes,\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nwe can live 200 years.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nOr it might be that it's just 30 or 40,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand I doubt that it's several hundred.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nSo this is something that people will be discussing\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nand lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nwho sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nAnd it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nworth making, because he says, what about the consequences?\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nof what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nAnd yet two random people will mate and have this child,\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nand both of them have some pretty rotten genes,\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nand the child is likely to come out to be average.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nWhich, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nIf we do have longevity, then we'll have to face the population growth\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nproblem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nthen we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nAnd so there won't be any workforce.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have,\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nis that a society that doesn't have people\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.958\nof working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse,\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nbecause there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old.\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nAnd when I'm talking about a long lifetime, of course,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nI don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nof what a 200-year-old is -- which is dead, actually.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nYou know, there's about 400 different parts of the brain\n\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nwhich seem to have different functions.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nNobody knows how most of them work in detail,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nbut we do know that there're lots of different things in there.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nthat most of them are cancelling each other out.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nAnd so if you think of yourself as a sort of city\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwith a hundred resources, then, when you're afraid, for example,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nyou may discard your long-range goals, but you may think deeply\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nand focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nYou throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nall you care about is not stepping out on that platform.\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nAnd when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nSo I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:54.958\nEmotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nis what you get when you remove 100 or 200\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nof your normally available resources.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nSo thinking of emotions as the opposite of -- as something\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nless than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope,\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nin the next few years, to show that this will lead to smart machines.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nAnd I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:20.958\non how we might make those smart machines and --\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:25.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:30.958\n-- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine\n\n00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nis one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you.\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nThis is a problem of such and such a type,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nand therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nthat are good for that problem.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nSo I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classify\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\ntypes of predicaments, types of situations, types of obstacles\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nand also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nSo you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwe lost the first hundred years of psychology\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nby really trivial theories, where you say,\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nhow do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nafter we go through a lot of levels, including designing\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.958\na huge, messy system with thousands of ports,\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwe'll end up again with the central problem of psychology.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nSaying, not what are the situations,\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nbut what are the kinds of problems\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nand what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them,\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nhow do you connect them up, how does a really creative person\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958\ninvent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nSo, I think in the next 20 years,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nif we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence,\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nlike neural nets and genetic algorithms\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nand rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say,\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:58.958\ncan we make a system that can use all those things\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nfor the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets;\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nwe know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them.\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nGenetic algorithms are great for certain things;\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nI suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nThank you.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:21.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "The psychology of evil", "duration": "1396", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/philip_zimbardo_on_the_psychology_of_evil", "transcript": "Philosophers, dramatists, theologians have grappled with this question for centuries: what makes people go wrong? Interestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid. I grew up in the South Bronx, inner-city ghetto in New York, and I was surrounded by evil, as all kids are who grew up in an inner city. And I had friends who were really good kids, who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario \u2014 Robert Louis Stevenson. That is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail. Some got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction. The only question is, what was in the juice? And more importantly, that line between good and evil \u2014 which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side, the others on the bad side \u2014 I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable. Good people could be seduced across that line, and under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover with help, with reform, with rehabilitation.So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher. If you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels. But let's look more deeply, and as we do, what appears is the demons, the devils in the world. That tells us several things.One, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil, because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition. It tells me something else. If you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer. Apparently, Lucifer means \"the light.\" It also means \"the morning star,\" in some scripture. And apparently, he disobeyed God, and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority. And when he did, Michael, the archangel, was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels. And so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan, becomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.Paradoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil. He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though. So, this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil, for me, sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good, ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.So the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives \u2014 the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are \u2014 leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power. And that's the key: it's about power. To intentionally harm people psychologically, to hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas, and to commit crimes against humanity. If you Google \"evil,\" a word that should surely have withered by now, you come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.A few years ago \u2014 I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was, with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation. I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised, because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.Immediately the Bush administration military said what? What all administrations say when there's a scandal: \"Don't blame us. It's not the system. It's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers.\" My hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually. Maybe it was the barrel that was bad. But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?I became an expert witness for one of the guards, Sergeant Chip Frederick, and in that position, I had access to the dozen investigative reports. I had access to him. I could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him, do psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple. And thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures that these soldiers took. These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature. All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers. Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera, they took pictures of everything, more than 1,000.And what I've done is I organized them into various categories. But these are by United States military police, army reservists. They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all. And it all happened in a single place, Tier 1-A, on the night shift. Why? Tier 1-A was the center for military intelligence. It was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there. Interrogators from Titan Corporation, all there, and they're getting no information about the insurgency. So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers, military police, to cross the line, give them permission to break the will of the enemy, to prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up, to take the gloves off. Those are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted. Let's go down to that dungeon.(Typewriting)[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008 Military Police Guards' Photos][The following images include nudity and graphic depictions of violence](Camera shutter sounds)(Thuds)(Camera shutter)(Camera shutter)(Breathing)(Bells)(Bells end)So, pretty horrific. That's one of the visual illustrations of evil. And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill. That prisoner covered himself with shit every day, they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink. But the guards ended up calling him \"Shit Boy.\" What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?In any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He comes down and says, \"I want to know, who is responsible? Who are the bad apples?\" Well, that's a bad question. You have to reframe it and ask, \"What is responsible?\" \"What\" could be the who of people, but it could also be the what of the situation, and obviously that's wrongheaded.How do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character, if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon? There are three ways. The main way is called dispositional. We look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples.This is the foundation of all of social science, the foundation of religion, the foundation of war. Social psychologists like me come along and say, \"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage, but you'll have to be aware of the situation. Who are the cast of characters? What's the costume? Is there a stage director?\" And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual \u2014 the bad barrel? Social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib. The power is in the system. The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals, and the system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background. And this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.If you want to change a person, change the situation. And to change it, you've got to know where the power is, in the system. So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors. And it's a dynamic interplay. What do the people bring into the situation? What does the situation bring out of them? And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?My recent book, \"The Lucifer Effect,\" is about, how do you understand how good people turn evil? And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today. So Dr. Z's \"Lucifer Effect,\" although it focuses on evil, really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel, caring or indifferent, creative or destructive, and it makes some of us villains. And the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes. This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk: \"I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome. Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not, depending on the circumstances.\"(Laughter)There's a study some of you think you know about, but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie. This is Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx, and he asked the question, \"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?\" People say, \"No, that's Nazi Germany, Hitler, you know, that's 1939.\" He said, \"Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you, 'Would you electrocute a stranger?' 'No way, I'm a good person.'\" He said, \"Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do?\"And so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people. 500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport. And the ad said, \"Psychologists want to understand memory. We want to improve people's memory, because it is the key to success.\" OK? \"We're going to give you five bucks \u2014 four dollars for your time. We don't want college students. We want men between 20 and 50.\" In the later studies, they ran women. Ordinary people: barbers, clerks, white-collar people.So, you go down, one of you will be a learner, one will be a teacher. The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy. He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room. The learner could be middle-aged, could be as young as 20. And one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat, \"Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn. Gets it right, reward. Gets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box. The first button is 15 volts. He doesn't even feel it.\" That's the key. All evil starts with 15 volts. And then the next step is another 15 volts. The problem is, at the end of the line, it's 450 volts. And as you go along, the guy is screaming, \"I've got a heart condition! I'm out of here!\"You're a good person. You complain. \"Sir, who will be responsible if something happens to him?\" The experimenter says, \"Don't worry, I will be responsible. Continue, teacher.\" And the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts? You should notice here, when it gets up to 375, it says, \"Danger. Severe Shock.\" When it gets up to here, there's \"XXX\" \u2014 the pornography of power.So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists, \"What percent of American citizens would go to the end?\" They said only one percent. Because that's sadistic behavior, and we know, psychiatry knows, only one percent of Americans are sadistic. OK. Here's the data. They could not be more wrong. Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts. This was just one study. Milgram did more than 16 studies. And look at this. In study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way, 90 percent go all the way. In study five, if you see people rebel, 90 percent rebel. What about women? Study 13 \u2014 no different than men. So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts. And it's like a dial on human nature. A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient, down to the majority, down to none.What are the external parallels? For all research is artificial. What's the validity in the real world? 912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978, because they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor \u2014 not their priest \u2014 their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones. He persuaded them to commit mass suicide. And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect, a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death. Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people. Most of the time, we are in institutions, so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior. Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.I did this study with my graduate students, especially Craig Haney \u2014 and it also began work with an ad. We had a cheap, little ad, but we wanted college students for a study of prison life. 75 people volunteered, took personality tests. We did interviews. Picked two dozen: the most normal, the most healthy. Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard. So on day one, we knew we had good apples. I'm going to put them in a bad situation.And secondly, we know there's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners. To the prisoners, we said, \"Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday.\" We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.(Video) (Music)[Day 1]Student: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door, and knocks, and says he's looking for me. So they, right there, you know, they took me out the door, they put my hands against the car. It was a real cop car, it was a real policeman, and there were real neighbors in the street, who didn't know that this was an experiment. And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around. They put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto. They took me to the basement of the police station. Then they put me in a cell. I was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell, which was just like a room with a door with bars on it. You could tell it wasn't a real jail. They locked me in there, in this degrading little outfit. They were taking this experiment too seriously.Here are the prisoners, who are going to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers. Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity. Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands, to do other humiliating tasks. They strip them naked. They sexually taunt them. They begin to do degrading activities, like having them simulate sodomy. You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib. My guards did it in five days. The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within 36 hours. The study ended after six days, because it was out of control. Five kids had emotional breakdowns.Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not? If they're anonymous, how do they treat their victims? In some cultures, they go to war without changing their appearance. In others, they paint themselves like \"Lord of the Flies.\" In some, they wear masks. In many, soldiers are anonymous in uniform. So this anthropologist, John Watson, found 23 cultures that had two bits of data. Do they change their appearance? 15. Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13. If they don't change their appearance, only one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates. The key is in the red zone. If they change their appearance, 12 of 13 \u2014 that's 90 percent \u2014 kill, torture, mutilate. And that's the power of anonymity.So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil? Mindlessly taking the first small step. Dehumanization of others. De-individuation of self. Diffusion of personal responsibility. Blind obedience to authority. Uncritical conformity to group norms. Passive tolerance of evil through inaction, or indifference.And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation. Your habitual response patterns don't work. Your personality and morality are disengaged. \"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing more difficult than understanding him,\" Dostoyevsky. Understanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse-ology.So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary, good people can be transformed without the drugs. You don't need it. You just need the social-psychological processes. Real world parallels? Compare this with this. James Schlesinger \u2014 I'm going to end with this \u2014 says, \"Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances.\" That's the Lucifer effect. And he goes on to say, \"The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations.\" If you give people power without oversight, it's a prescription for abuse. They knew that, and let that happen.So another report, an investigative report by General Fay, says the system is guilty. In this report, he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib, by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse, and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time. Those abuses went on for three months. Who was watching the store? The answer is nobody, I think on purpose. He gave the guards permission to do those things, and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas. The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual. The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease. Bullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease. Violence is a disease. Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing with problems at the individual level. It doesn't work. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, \"The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.\" That means that line is not out there. That's a decision that you have to make, a personal thing.So I want to end very quickly on a positive note. Heroism as the antidote to evil, by promoting the heroic imagination, especially in our kids, in our educational system. We want kids to think, \"I'm a hero in waiting, waiting for the right situation to come along, and I will act heroically. My whole life, I'm now going to focus away from evil \u2014 that I've been in since I was a kid \u2014 to understanding heroes.Banality of heroism. It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds. It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's \"Banality of Evil.\" Our traditional societal heroes are wrong, because they are the exceptions. They organize their life around this. That's why we know their names. Our kids' heroes are also wrong models for them, because they have supernatural talents. We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people, and the heroic act is unusual. This is Joe Darby. He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw, because when he saw those images, he turned them over to a senior investigating officer. He was a low-level private, and that stopped it. Was he a hero? No. They had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him, and then his mother and his wife. For three years, they were in hiding.This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study. When I said it got out of control, I was the prison superintendent. I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent. She saw that madhouse and said, \"You know what, it's terrible what you're doing to those boys. They're not prisoners nor guards, they're boys, and you are responsible.\" And I ended the study the next day. The good news is I married her the next year.(Laughter)(Applause)I just came to my senses, obviously.So situations have the power to do [three things]. But the point is, this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us, that makes us perpetrators of evil, can inspire the heroic imagination in others. It's the same situation and you're on one side or the other. Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction, because your mother said, \"Don't get involved. Mind your own business.\" And you have to say, \"Mama, humanity is my business.\"So the psychology of heroism is \u2014 we're going to end in a moment \u2014 how do we encourage children in new hero courses, that I'm working on with Matt Langdon \u2014 he has a hero workshop \u2014 to develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling, \"I am a hero in waiting,\" and teach them skills. To be a hero, you have to learn to be a deviant, because you're always going against the conformity of the group. Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.The key to heroism is two things. You have to act when other people are passive. B: You have to act socio-centrically, not egocentrically. And I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero. Fifty-year-old African-American construction worker standing on a subway. A white guy falls on the tracks. The subway train is coming. There's 75 people there. You know what? They freeze. He's got a reason not to get involved. He's black, the guy's white, and he's got two kids. Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger, jumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks, lays on him, the subway goes over him. Wesley and the guy \u2014 20 and a half inches height. The train clearance is 21 inches. A half an inch would have taken his head off. And he said, \"I did what anyone could do,\" no big deal to jump on the tracks.And the moral imperative is \"I did what everyone should do.\" And so one day, you will be in a new situation. Take path one, you're going to be a perpetrator of evil. Evil, meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen. You're going to cheat, or you're going to allow bullying. Path two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction. Path three, you become a hero. The point is, are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes, waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action? Because it may only happen once in your life, and when you pass it by, you'll always know, I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by. So the point is thinking it and then doing it.So I want to thank you. Thank you. Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad, and let's focus on the positive. Advocate for respect of personal dignity, for justice and peace, which sadly our administration has not been doing.Thanks so much.(Applause)", "id": 272, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:16.148\nPhilosophers, dramatists, theologians\n\n00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:18.378\nhave grappled with\nthis question for centuries:\n\n00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:19.934\nwhat makes people go wrong?\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.934\nInterestingly, I asked this question\nwhen I was a little kid.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.014\nI grew up in the South Bronx,\ninner-city ghetto in New York,\n\n00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:27.521\nand I was surrounded by evil,\n\n00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.101\nas all kids are who grew up\nin an inner city.\n\n00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.450\nAnd I had friends\nwho were really good kids,\n\n00:00:32.474 --> 00:00:36.766\nwho lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde\nscenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.934\nThat is, they took drugs,\ngot in trouble, went to jail.\n\n00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.817\nSome got killed, and some did it\nwithout drug assistance.\n\n00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:47.040\nSo when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,\nthat wasn't fiction.\n\n00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:49.288\nThe only question is,\nwhat was in the juice?\n\n00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:52.934\nAnd more importantly, that line\nbetween good and evil --\n\n00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.426\nwhich privileged people like to think\nis fixed and impermeable,\n\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.123\nwith them on the good side,\nthe others on the bad side --\n\n00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:02.210\nI knew that line was movable,\nand it was permeable.\n\n00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:04.577\nGood people could be\nseduced across that line,\n\n00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.805\nand under good and some rare\ncircumstances, bad kids could recover\n\n00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.125\nwith help, with reform,\nwith rehabilitation.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.435\nSo I want to begin\nwith this wonderful illusion\n\n00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.733\nby [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.\n\n00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.618\nIf you look at it and focus on the white,\nwhat you see is a world full of angels.\n\n00:01:20.642 --> 00:01:23.210\nBut let's look more deeply, and as we do,\n\n00:01:23.234 --> 00:01:26.255\nwhat appears is the demons,\nthe devils in the world.\n\n00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.171\nThat tells us several things.\n\n00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:31.303\nOne, the world is, was, will always\nbe filled with good and evil,\n\n00:01:31.327 --> 00:01:34.375\nbecause good and evil is the yin and yang\nof the human condition.\n\n00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.685\nIt tells me something else.\n\n00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.737\nIf you remember,\nGod's favorite angel was Lucifer.\n\n00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:41.685\nApparently, Lucifer means \"the light.\"\n\n00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.435\nIt also means \"the morning star,\"\nin some scripture.\n\n00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.664\nAnd apparently, he disobeyed God,\n\n00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:50.180\nand that's the ultimate\ndisobedience to authority.\n\n00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:55.702\nAnd when he did, Michael, the archangel,\nwas sent to kick him out of heaven\n\n00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:57.729\nalong with the other fallen angels.\n\n00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.934\nAnd so Lucifer descends into hell,\nbecomes Satan,\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nbecomes the devil, and the force\nof evil in the universe begins.\n\n00:02:03.982 --> 00:02:08.451\nParadoxically, it was God\nwho created hell as a place to store evil.\n\n00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.315\nHe didn't do a good job\nof keeping it there though.\n\n00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:15.928\nSo, this arc of the cosmic transformation\nof God's favorite angel into the Devil,\n\n00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:19.596\nfor me, sets the context\nfor understanding human beings\n\n00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.934\nwho are transformed from good,\nordinary people into perpetrators of evil.\n\n00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:28.562\nSo the Lucifer effect,\nalthough it focuses on the negatives --\n\n00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.241\nthe negatives that people can become,\n\n00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:33.227\nnot the negatives that people are --\n\n00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.605\nleads me to a psychological definition.\n\n00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.602\nEvil is the exercise of power.\n\n00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:40.865\nAnd that's the key: it's about power.\n\n00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.454\nTo intentionally harm\npeople psychologically,\n\n00:02:43.478 --> 00:02:47.208\nto hurt people physically,\nto destroy people mortally, or ideas,\n\n00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.426\nand to commit crimes against humanity.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:54.244\nIf you Google \"evil,\" a word that should\nsurely have withered by now,\n\n00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:57.934\nyou come up with 136 million hits\nin a third of a second.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.456\nA few years ago -- I am sure\nall of you were shocked, as I was,\n\n00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.934\nwith the revelation of American soldiers\nabusing prisoners in a strange place\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.934\nin a controversial war,\nAbu Ghraib in Iraq.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.965\nAnd these were men and women\n\n00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.276\nwho were putting prisoners\nthrough unbelievable humiliation.\n\n00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.744\nI was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,\n\n00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:21.934\nbecause I had seen\nthose same visual parallels\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.360\nwhen I was the prison superintendent\nof the Stanford Prison Study.\n\n00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:28.099\nImmediately the Bush\nadministration military said what?\n\n00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.979\nWhat all administrations say\nwhen there's a scandal:\n\n00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:32.853\n\"Don't blame us. It's not the system.\n\n00:03:32.877 --> 00:03:35.277\nIt's the few bad apples,\nthe few rogue soldiers.\"\n\n00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:38.332\nMy hypothesis is,\nAmerican soldiers are good, usually.\n\n00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:40.417\nMaybe it was the barrel that was bad.\n\n00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:42.934\nBut how am I going to deal\nwith that hypothesis?\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.478\nI became an expert witness\nfor one of the guards,\n\n00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:47.645\nSergeant Chip Frederick,\nand in that position,\n\n00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.582\nI had access to the dozen\ninvestigative reports.\n\n00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.406\nI had access to him.\n\n00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.731\nI could study him, have him come\nto my home, get to know him,\n\n00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:59.162\ndo psychological analysis to see,\nwas he a good apple or bad apple.\n\n00:03:59.186 --> 00:04:03.097\nAnd thirdly, I had access\nto all of the 1,000 pictures\n\n00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.334\nthat these soldiers took.\n\n00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:07.333\nThese pictures are\nof a violent or sexual nature.\n\n00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.316\nAll of them come from the cameras\nof American soldiers.\n\n00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:13.626\nBecause everybody has\na digital camera or cell phone camera,\n\n00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.984\nthey took pictures of everything,\nmore than 1,000.\n\n00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:18.962\nAnd what I've done is I organized them\ninto various categories.\n\n00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:23.925\nBut these are by United States\nmilitary police, army reservists.\n\n00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:27.917\nThey are not soldiers prepared\nfor this mission at all.\n\n00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:31.614\nAnd it all happened in a single place,\nTier 1-A, on the night shift.\n\n00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:32.839\nWhy?\n\n00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:35.465\nTier 1-A was the center\nfor military intelligence.\n\n00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:37.465\nIt was the interrogation hold.\n\n00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:38.690\nThe CIA was there.\n\n00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:41.872\nInterrogators from\nTitan Corporation, all there,\n\n00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:44.682\nand they're getting no information\nabout the insurgency.\n\n00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:47.176\nSo they're going to put pressure\non these soldiers,\n\n00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.920\nmilitary police, to cross the line,\n\n00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:51.934\ngive them permission to break\nthe will of the enemy,\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.435\nto prepare them for interrogation,\nto soften them up,\n\n00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:55.685\nto take the gloves off.\n\n00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:58.837\nThose are the euphemisms,\nand this is how it was interpreted.\n\n00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:01.362\nLet's go down to that dungeon.\n\n00:05:03.243 --> 00:05:04.552\n(Typewriting)\n\n00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:10.585\n[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008\nMilitary Police Guards' Photos]\n\n00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:17.403\n[The

00:06:56.891\nAnd it should not have escaped you\n\n00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.152\nthat the reason I paired\nthe prisoner with his arms out\n\n00:07:00.176 --> 00:07:02.934\nwith Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.540\nis that that prisoner was mentally ill.\n\n00:07:05.564 --> 00:07:07.917\nThat prisoner covered himself\nwith shit every day,\n\n00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.359\nthey had to roll him in dirt\nso he wouldn't stink.\n\n00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.731\nBut the guards ended up\ncalling him \"Shit Boy.\"\n\n00:07:12.755 --> 00:07:16.934\nWhat was he doing in that prison\nrather than in some mental institution?\n\n00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.170\nIn any event, here's former\nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld.\n\n00:07:20.194 --> 00:07:23.004\nHe comes down and says,\n\"I want to know, who is responsible?\n\n00:07:23.028 --> 00:07:24.407\nWho are the bad apples?\"\n\n00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:25.839\nWell, that's a bad question.\n\n00:07:25.863 --> 00:07:28.484\nYou have to reframe it and ask,\n\"What is responsible?\"\n\n00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.156\n\"What\" could be the who of people,\n\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.717\nbut it could also be\nthe what of the situation,\n\n00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:34.427\nand obviously that's wrongheaded.\n\n00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:38.296\nHow do psychologists try to understand\nsuch transformations of human character,\n\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.320\nif you believe\nthat they were good soldiers\n\n00:07:40.344 --> 00:07:42.154\nbefore they went down to that dungeon?\n\n00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:45.040\nThere are three ways.\nThe main way is called dispositional.\n\n00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:47.934\nWe look at what's inside\nof the person, the bad apples.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.269\nThis is the foundation\nof all of social science,\n\n00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.953\nthe foundation of religion,\nthe foundation of war.\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.197\nSocial psychologists like me\ncome along and say,\n\n00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:59.340\n\"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,\n\n00:07:59.364 --> 00:08:01.714\nbut you'll have to be aware\nof the situation.\n\n00:08:01.738 --> 00:08:04.119\nWho are the cast of characters?\nWhat's the costume?\n\n00:08:04.143 --> 00:08:05.602\nIs there a stage director?\"\n\n00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:08.293\nAnd so we're interested in\nwhat are the external factors\n\n00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:10.293\naround the individual -- the bad barrel?\n\n00:08:10.862 --> 00:08:13.509\nSocial scientists stop there\nand they miss the big point\n\n00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:16.772\nthat I discovered when I became\nan expert witness for Abu Ghraib.\n\n00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.347\nThe power is in the system.\n\n00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:21.612\nThe system creates the situation\nthat corrupts the individuals,\n\n00:08:21.636 --> 00:08:26.420\nand the system is the legal, political,\neconomic, cultural background.\n\n00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:29.738\nAnd this is where the power\nis of the bad-barrel makers.\n\n00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:32.598\nIf you want to change a person,\nchange the situation.\n\n00:08:32.622 --> 00:08:36.011\nAnd to change it, you've got to know\nwhere the power is, in the system.\n\n00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:38.083\nSo the Lucifer effect\ninvolves understanding\n\n00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:42.562\nhuman character transformations\nwith these three factors.\n\n00:08:43.082 --> 00:08:44.471\nAnd it's a dynamic interplay.\n\n00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:46.561\nWhat do the people bring\ninto the situation?\n\n00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:48.593\nWhat does the situation bring out of them?\n\n00:08:48.617 --> 00:08:51.934\nAnd what is the system\nthat creates and maintains that situation?\n\n00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.866\nMy recent book,\n\"The Lucifer Effect,\" is about,\n\n00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.129\nhow do you understand\nhow good people turn evil?\n\n00:08:57.153 --> 00:09:00.416\nAnd it has a lot of detail\nabout what I'm going to talk about today.\n\n00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:03.934\nSo Dr. Z's \"Lucifer Effect,\"\nalthough it focuses on evil,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:08.118\nreally is a celebration of the human\nmind's infinite capacity\n\n00:09:08.142 --> 00:09:10.700\nto make any of us kind or cruel,\n\n00:09:10.724 --> 00:09:13.246\ncaring or indifferent,\ncreative or destructive,\n\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.548\nand it makes some of us villains.\n\n00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:18.669\nAnd the good news that I'm going\nto hopefully come to at the end\n\n00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:20.460\nis that it makes some of us heroes.\n\n00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:25.158\nThis wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker\nsummarizes my whole talk:\n\n00:09:25.182 --> 00:09:27.325\n\"I'm neither a good cop\nnor a bad cop, Jerome.\n\n00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:29.308\nLike yourself, I'm a complex amalgam\n\n00:09:29.332 --> 00:09:31.801\nof positive and negative\npersonality traits\n\n00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:35.315\nthat emerge or not, depending\non the circumstances.\"\n\n00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:37.324\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:37.348 --> 00:09:40.200\nThere's a study some of you\nthink you know about,\n\n00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.411\nbut very few people\nhave ever read the story.\n\n00:09:42.435 --> 00:09:44.360\nYou watched the movie.\n\n00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:47.733\nThis is Stanley Milgram,\nlittle Jewish kid from the Bronx,\n\n00:09:47.757 --> 00:09:50.856\nand he asked the question,\n\"Could the Holocaust happen here, now?\"\n\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.385\nPeople say, \"No, that's Nazi Germany,\nHitler, you know, that's 1939.\"\n\n00:09:54.409 --> 00:09:56.802\nHe said, \"Yeah, but suppose\nHitler asked you,\n\n00:09:56.826 --> 00:09:59.996\n'Would you electrocute a stranger?'\n'No way, I'm a good person.'\"\n\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.116\nHe

You just need\nthe social-psychological processes.\n\n00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:22.484\nReal world parallels?\n\n00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:24.692\nCompare this with this.\n\n00:17:25.934 --> 00:17:28.622\nJames Schlesinger --\nI'm going to end with this -- says,\n\n00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:31.245\n\"Psychologists have attempted\nto understand how and why\n\n00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:33.698\nindividuals and groups\nwho usually act humanely\n\n00:17:33.722 --> 00:17:36.910\ncan sometimes act otherwise\nin certain circumstances.\"\n\n00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:38.173\nThat's the Lucifer effect.\n\n00:17:38.197 --> 00:17:40.626\nAnd he goes on to say,\n\"The landmark Stanford study\n\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:44.570\nprovides a cautionary tale\nfor all military operations.\"\n\n00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:46.934\nIf you give people power\nwithout oversight,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.441\nit's a prescription for abuse.\n\n00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:50.876\nThey knew that, and let that happen.\n\n00:17:51.635 --> 00:17:54.715\nSo another report, an investigative\nreport by General Fay,\n\n00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:56.689\nsays the system is guilty.\n\n00:17:56.713 --> 00:18:00.176\nIn this report, he says it was\nthe environment that created Abu Ghraib,\n\n00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.582\nby leadership failures that contributed\nto the occurrence of such abuse,\n\n00:18:03.606 --> 00:18:05.516\nand because it remained undiscovered\n\n00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.780\nby higher authorities\nfor a long period of time.\n\n00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:09.629\nThose abuses went on for three months.\n\n00:18:09.653 --> 00:18:11.261\nWho was watching the store?\n\n00:18:11.285 --> 00:18:13.532\nThe answer is nobody, I think on purpose.\n\n00:18:13.556 --> 00:18:15.849\nHe gave the guards permission\nto do those things,\n\n00:18:15.873 --> 00:18:18.937\nand they knew nobody was ever going\nto come down to that dungeon.\n\n00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:21.529\nSo you need a paradigm shift\nin all of these areas.\n\n00:18:21.553 --> 00:18:25.230\nThe shift is away from the medical model\nthat focuses only on the individual.\n\n00:18:25.254 --> 00:18:27.934\nThe shift is toward a public health model\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.740\nthat recognizes situational\nand systemic vectors of disease.\n\n00:18:31.764 --> 00:18:34.101\nBullying is a disease.\nPrejudice is a disease.\n\n00:18:34.125 --> 00:18:35.293\nViolence is a disease.\n\n00:18:35.317 --> 00:18:39.085\nSince the Inquisition, we've been dealing\nwith problems at the individual level.\n\n00:18:39.109 --> 00:18:40.550\nIt doesn't work.\n\n00:18:40.574 --> 00:18:43.390\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,\n\"The line between good and evil\n\n00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:45.534\ncuts through the heart\nof every human being.\"\n\n00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:47.370\nThat means that line is not out there.\n\n00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:50.365\nThat's a decision that you have\nto make, a personal thing.\n\n00:18:50.389 --> 00:18:52.934\nSo I want to end very quickly\non a positive note.\n\n00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.910\nHeroism as the antidote to evil,\n\n00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.829\nby promoting the heroic imagination,\n\n00:18:57.853 --> 00:19:00.351\nespecially in our kids,\nin our educational system.\n\n00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:02.839\nWe want kids to think,\n\"I'm a hero in waiting,\n\n00:19:02.863 --> 00:19:05.006\nwaiting for the right\nsituation to come along,\n\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.573\nand I will act heroically.\n\n00:19:06.597 --> 00:19:09.275\nMy whole life, I'm now going\nto focus away from evil --\n\n00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:12.252\nthat I've been in since I was a kid\n-- to understanding heroes.\n\n00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.441\nBanality of heroism.\n\n00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:15.469\nIt's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.\n\n00:19:15.493 --> 00:19:18.439\nIt's the counterpoint\nto Hannah Arendt's \"Banality of Evil.\"\n\n00:19:18.463 --> 00:19:22.424\nOur traditional societal heroes are wrong,\nbecause they are the exceptions.\n\n00:19:22.448 --> 00:19:25.783\nThey organize their life around this.\nThat's why we know their names.\n\n00:19:25.807 --> 00:19:28.085\nOur kids' heroes\nare also wrong models for them,\n\n00:19:28.109 --> 00:19:30.053\nbecause they have supernatural talents.\n\n00:19:30.077 --> 00:19:33.038\nWe want our kids to realize\nmost heroes are everyday people,\n\n00:19:33.062 --> 00:19:35.166\nand the heroic act is unusual.\n\n00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.481\nThis is Joe Darby.\n\n00:19:36.505 --> 00:19:38.791\nHe was the one that stopped\nthose abuses you saw,\n\n00:19:38.815 --> 00:19:40.408\nbecause when he saw those images,\n\n00:19:40.432 --> 00:19:43.003\nhe turned them over\nto a senior investigating officer.\n\n00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:45.755\nHe was a low-level private,\nand that stopped it.\n\n00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:46.957\nWas he a hero? No.\n\n00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:50.131\nThey had to put him in hiding,\nbecause people wanted to kill him,\n\n00:19:50.155 --> 00:19:51.807\nand then his mother and his wife.\n\n00:19:51.831 --> 00:19:53.716\nFor three years, they were in hiding.\n\n00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.426\nThis is the woman who stopped\nthe Stanford Prison Study.\n\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.699\nWhen I said it got out of control,\nI was the prison superintendent.\n\n00:19:59.723 --> 00:20:02.722\nI didn't know it was out of control.\nI was totally indifferent.\n\n00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:04.337\nShe saw that madhouse and said,\n\n00:20:04.361 --> 00:20:07.266\n\"You know what, it's terrible\nwhat you're doing to those boys.\n\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.934\nThey're not prisoners nor guards,\nthey're boys, and you are responsible.\"\n\n00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.934\nAnd I ended the study the next day.\n\n00:20:13.497 --> 00:20:15.607\nThe good news\nis I married her the next year.\n\n00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:17.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:24.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:20:25.403 --> 00:20:27.414\nI just came to my senses, obviously.\n\n00:20:27.438 --> 00:20:30.107\nSo situations have the power\nto do [three things].\n\n00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:32.912\nBut the point is,\nthis is the same situation\n\n00:20:32.936 --> 00:20:36.402\nthat can inflame the hostile\nimagination in some of us,\n\n00:20:36.426 --> 00:20:38.163\nthat makes us perpetrators of evil,\n\n00:20:38.187 --> 00:20:40.380\ncan inspire the heroic\nimagination in others.\n\n00:20:40.404 --> 00:20:43.518\nIt's the same situation\nand you're on one side or the other.\n\n00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.733\nMost people are guilty\nof the evil of inaction,\n\n00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:49.105\nbecause your mother said, \"Don't get\ninvolved.

I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine.And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. And I asked myself, why? I felt shy, I felt embarrassed. And then my question became, am I the only one who does this? So, I decided to investigate.I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them. But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son. It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need? I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, \"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,\" but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this. She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, \"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids.\" And he goes, \"Oh, this is great, this is great.\" And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that. And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores. And she said, \"Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?\"So, the question is, why was I blocking it? Why were other people blocking it? Why can I say, \"I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes,\" but I won't say, \"Would you praise me this way?\" And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy. Because what can you do with that data? You could neglect me. You could abuse it. Or you could actually meet my need.And I took my bike into the bike store\u2014 I love this \u2014 same bike, and they'd do something called \"truing\" the wheels. The guy said, \"You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better.\" I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new. So, I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife \u2014 go ask her, what does she need? Go home to your husband \u2014 what does he need? Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.And it's simple. And why should we care about this? We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages? I think it starts household by household, under the same roof. So, let's make it right in our own backyard. And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons. And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job. And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas.Thank you.

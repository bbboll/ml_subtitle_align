"transcript": "Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today, since many of you are wondering, I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better.Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?Audience: Yes.SB: What is it?Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about 20, 30 searches, or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now, by language.So you can see: here we are in the U.S., and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey \u2014 hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night, right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets. And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day, is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.Now you can also see, if I turn this around here \u2014 hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much. Australia, because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on, which is Africa, which is just a few trickles, basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically, what we've noticed is these queries, which come in at thousands per second, are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica \u2014 well, at least this time of year \u2014 we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly, I think the International Space Station would have it, too.So this is some of the challenge that we have here, is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the \u2014 there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world: through fibers, through satellites, through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also, once again \u2014 so some places are much more wired than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S., going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides \u2014 all right, here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing, is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now, each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean, it could be somebody's health, it could be somebody's career, something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce, or in this case, ketchup.So this is a query that we had \u2014 I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain, it went to Italy, and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally, finally started to like it, too. And I just wanted to play it for you.Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves \u2014 hopefully that search will work. As a part of \u2014 you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals, if they start doing searches as well. But partly, we want to make the world a better place, and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation, and we're in the process of setting that up.We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over 150 different charities around the world, and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact, many of the organizations that are here \u2014 the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet \u2014 and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know.One of the earlier results that we got \u2014 we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education, and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been many, many stories that have come in, because we do have hundreds of charities in there, and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is? A-ha!Audience: Orkut.SB: Yes! Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut? Do we have any? Okay, not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking, \"Yet another social network.\" But it was a dream of his, and we, basically, when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month, and it's been taking off.This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how \u2014 we just deployed it \u2014 we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service, and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over 100,000 members. And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here \u2014 though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic \u2014 but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe, and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And \u2014 well, I'll leave you in suspense. Larry, you can explain this one.Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey. So one of the things \u2014 both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school, and I think, for some reason, this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that, you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time, and we call this \u2014 at Google, we've embodied this as \"the 20 percent time,\" and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time, if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many, many things at Google have come out of that, such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students, actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics \u2014 as a hobby, basically. So many, many useful things come out of this.And News, which I just mentioned, was started by a researcher. And he just \u2014 he \u2014 after 9/11, he got really interested in the news. And he said, \"Why don't I look at the news better?\" And so he started clustering it by category, and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it. And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom, we made it a Googlette, which is basically a small project at Google.So it'd be like three people, or something like that, and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people working on it for a while, and then more and more people started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet, and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running.I think usually, as companies get bigger, they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects. And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said, \"Oh, we really need a new concept.\" You know, the Googlettes \u2014 that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not, but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them, some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects. And I don't know about all of you, but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them \u2014 and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example, the \"Buy Iceland\" was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing, but \u2014 in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them, that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me, but we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head, which you did by writing them down, that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well-organized.The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important, and so naturally, people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new, or you might not know about. And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar. So this is a new \u2014 how many of you use the Google Toolbar? Raise your hands.How many of you use the Deskbar? All right, see? You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for \"Deskbar,\" you'll get this. And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom, and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you, Sergey.This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about, and they just, they got going, and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool, which lets you \u2014 for five to 100 dollars, you can type a question in, and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that, and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself.Froogle lets you search shopping information, and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these \u2014 well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that \u2014 you know, we try many, many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space, and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off, and they're noisy, so people shut them off. And we didn't like that, so we actually, in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result, we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting, so when you walk into a meeting room now, it lists all the meetings that are happening, you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting.And as we become more of a global company, we find these things really affect us \u2014 you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room? And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings, and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ... we also allow dogs and things like that, and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company, which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.This is actually our \"cult picture.\" I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while, but we found that after we put it on our website, we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway, every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work.Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said, \"Well, that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day?\"One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense, and this is a little bit foreshadowing \u2014 this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example, we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read, but this says \"Battle for New Hampshire: Howard Dean for President\" \u2014 articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically \u2014 like in this case, on the Washington Post \u2014 from the content on the site. And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at, much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful, not just annoying, right?And the nice thing about this, we have a self-serve program, and many thousands of websites have signed up, and this let's them really make money. And I \u2014 you know, there's a number of people I met \u2014 I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party, and he said, \"You know, I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month. And, you know, thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.\" And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better, it makes searching work better, when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content.So this session is supposed to be about the future, so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search, you really have to be smart. Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google, and you expect an answer back, right? But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence. And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on, and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now, and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart, but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq, and it's not really what I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this. So we decided \u2014 actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.So, \"related searches,\" right there. You can't see it that well, but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads, called \"related searches.\" And so we'd say, you know, \"Did you mean 'search for'\" \u2014 what is this, in this case, \"Saddam Hussein,\" because this blog is about Iraq \u2014 and you know, in addition to the ads, and we thought this would be a great idea.And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said, \"You know, I'm sleeping a lot.\" He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms \u2014 not a person, of course, but our algorithms, our computers \u2014 read his blog and decided that the related search was, \"I am bored.\" And he read this, and he thought a person had decided that he was boring, and it was very unfortunate, and he said, \"You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing? Why don't they like my blog?\" And so then we read his blog, which was getting \u2014 you know, sort of going from bad to worse, and we said the related search was, \"Retards.\" And then, you know, he got even more mad, and he wrote \u2014 like, started swearing and so on. And then we produced \"You suck.\" And finally, it ended with \"Kiss my ass.\" And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore.So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google, and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold, for example, for less money in places that are poor, and then they get re-imported into the U.S. \u2014 for example, with the drug industry.And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search, and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information, and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine \u2014 that we should provide very objective information.And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising, and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world, and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.

Does anyone know what that is?\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nAudience: Yes.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nSB: What is it?\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nAudience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nSB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:54.958\nBut this is what helped me see it.\n\n00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.958\nThis is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.\n\n00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nHere it's slightly logged.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nBut here you can see around the world\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nhow people are using Google.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nAnd every one of those rising dots\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nrepresents probably about 20, 30 searches,\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nor something like that.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd they're labeled by color right now, by language.\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:17.958\nSo you can see: here we are in the U.S.,\n\n00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nand they're all coming up red.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nThere we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nYou can see that Japan is busy at night,\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nright there.\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nWe have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.958\nThere's a lot of activity in China.\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nThere's a lot of activity in India.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nThere's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nAnd Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:45.958\nis going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nNow you can also see, if I turn this around here --\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nhopefully I won't shake the world too much.\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nBut you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nAustralia, because there just aren't very many people there.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nAnd this is something that we should really work on,\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.958\nwhich is Africa, which is just a few trickles,\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nbasically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nBut basically, what we've noticed is these queries,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nwhich come in at thousands per second,\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nare available everywhere there is power.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nAnd pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:37.958\nAnd even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nwe from time to time will see a query rising up.\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nAnd if we had it plotted correctly,\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nI think the International Space Station would have it, too.\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nSo this is\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nsome of the challenge that we have here,\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nis you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nthere we go.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nThis is how we have to move the bits around\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nto actually get the people the answers to their questions.\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nYou can see that there's a lot of data running around.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nIt has to go all over the world: through fibers,\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nthrough satellites, through all kinds of connections.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:27.958\nAnd it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies\n\n00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nas low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:33.958\nBut you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthan others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.958\ngoing up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nNow what I would like to do is just to show you\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nwhat one second of this activity would look like.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd if we can switch to slides --\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nall right, here we go.\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nSo this is slowed down.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nThis is what one second looks like.\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\nis just making sure that we can keep up\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.958\nwith this kind of traffic load.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nNow, each one of those queries\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nhas an interesting life and tale of its own.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nI mean, it could be somebody's health,\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nit could be somebody's career, something important to them.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd it could potentially be something\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nas important as tomato sauce,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nor in this case, ketchup.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo this is a query that we had --\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nI guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nYou can see that it got started right here.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nIn the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nBut it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nas it did in Spain.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nAnd then from Spain, it went to Italy,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nand then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nAnd so I guess the U.S. finally,\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nfinally started to like it, too.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nAnd I just wanted to play it for you.\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nAnyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nhopefully that search will work.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nAs a part of --\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nyou know, part of what we want to do to grow our company\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nis to have more searches.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nAnd what that means is we want to have\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nmore people who are healthy and educated.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nMore animals, if they start doing searches as well.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nBut partly, we want to make the world a better place,\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nand we're in the process of setting that up.\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nWe also have a program already called Google Grants\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nthat now serves over 150 different charities around the world,\n\n00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand these are some of the charities that are on there.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nAnd it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nIn fact, many of the organizations that are here --\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nthe Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nThey run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nso they can let organizations know.\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nOne of the earlier results that we got --\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nwe have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nof 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nmany, many stories that have come in,\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nbecause we do have hundreds of charities in there,\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nand the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nNow does anybody know who this is?\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nA-ha!\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAudience: Orkut.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nSB: Yes! Somebody got it.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nThis is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nDo we have any?\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nOkay, not very many people know about it.\n\n00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nI'll explain it in a second.\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nThis is one of our engineers.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nWe find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nThat's how we churn those products out.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nOrkut had a vision to create a social network.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nI know all of you are thinking, \"Yet another social network.\"\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut it was a dream of his, and we, basically,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nwhen people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nSo this is what he built.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:28.958\nWe just released it in a test phase last month,\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nand it's been taking off.\n\n00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:32.958\nThis is our VP of Engineering.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nYou can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nAnd these are all of his friends.\n\n00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nSo this is how -- we just deployed it --\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nwe just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nAnd now we've grown to over 100,000 members.\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nAnd they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nYou can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthough, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nbut it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand all the rest of the countries.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo it's a fun little project.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nThere are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nBut it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nand see where it goes.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nAnd --\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nwell, I'll leave you in suspense.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nLarry, you can explain this one.\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nLarry Page: Thank you, Sergey.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSo one of the things -- both Sergey and I\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nwent to a Montessori school,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nand I think, for some reason,\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nthis has been incorporated in Google.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nAnd Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nyou know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nand we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as \"the 20 percent time,\"\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nand the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nif you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nAnd many, many things at Google have come out of that,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:06.958\nsuch as Orkut and also Google News.\n\n00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nMendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nactually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nas a hobby, basically.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo many, many useful things come out of this.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd News, which I just mentioned,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nwas started by a researcher.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd he said, \"Why don't I look at the news better?\"\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nAnd so he started clustering it by category,\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nand then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nAnd then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwe made it a Googlette,\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:52.958\nwhich is basically a small project at Google.\n\n00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nSo it'd be like three people, or something like that,\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nand they would try to make a product.\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nAnd we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nAnd in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nworking on it for a while, and then more and more people\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nstarted using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nand more and more people started using it.\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nAnd now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nAnd this is how we keep our innovation running.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nI think usually, as companies get bigger,\n\n00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nthey find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.958\n\"Oh, we really need a new concept.\"\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nYou know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nbut we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nsome of them will really work and turn out, such as News.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBut then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:43.958\nAnd I don't know about all of you,\n\n00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nbut I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nAnd we found that if we just wrote all of them down\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nDon't really pay attention to them.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.958\nFor example, the \"Buy Iceland\" was from a media article.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nWe would never do such a crazy thing, but --\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nin any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nthat most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd this was kind of a surprise to me, but\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwe found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwhich you did by writing them down,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nthat you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nand where to put your resources.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd so that's basically what we've done\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nsince we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nand still stay reasonably well-organized.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nThe other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nand so naturally,\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:43.958\npeople sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nI just wanted to highlight a couple of things\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nthat are new, or you might not know about.\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nSo this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nRaise your hands.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nHow many of you use the Deskbar?\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nAll right, see? You guys should try it out.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nBut if you go to our site and search\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nfor \"Deskbar,\" you'll get this.\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nAnd the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.958\non your screen on the bottom,\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand you can do searches really easily.\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nAnd it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nThank you, Sergey.\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nThis is another example of a project that somebody at Google\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nwas really passionate about, and they just, they got going,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.958\nand it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nGoogle Answers is something we started, which is really cool,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nwhich lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nyou can type a question in,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nand then there's a pool of researchers\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:43.958\nthat go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,\n\n00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nand you can get actually very good answers to things\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nwithout spending all that time yourself.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nFroogle lets you search shopping information,\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nand Blogger lets you publish things.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nBut all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nyou know, we try many, many different things\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nin our company.\n\n00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nWe also like to innovate in our physical space,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nand we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nfor projectors to turn on and off,\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand they're noisy, so people shut them off.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd we didn't like that, so we actually,\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nin maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:19.958\nthat enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand they're completely silent.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nAnd as a result, we were able to build some software\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat also lets us manage a meeting,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nso when you walk into a meeting room now,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nit lists all the meetings that are happening,\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nyou can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nto all the people that were present in the meeting.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAnd as we become more of a global company,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.958\nwe find these things really affect us --\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nyou know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nAnd things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.\n\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nWe also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nand they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nAnd so we found it was pretty helpful\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nto have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nwe also allow dogs and things like that,\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nand we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nwhich helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nThis is actually our \"cult picture.\"\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nI just wanted to show quickly.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWe had this on our website for a while,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nbut we found that after we put it on our website,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nwe didn't get any job applications anymore.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nBut anyway, every year we've taken\n\n00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nthe whole company on a ski trip.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.958\nA lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nAnd I think we've done a good job encouraging that.\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nIt makes it a really fun place to work.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nAlong with our logos, too, which I think really embody\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nour culture when we change things.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nIn the early days, we were actually advised\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nwe should never change our logo because\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nwe should establish our brand, you know,\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nbecause, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nYou want it to be consistent.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nAnd we said, \"Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nWhy don't we try changing it every day?\"\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nOne of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nis we have this thing called AdSense,\n\n00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nand this is a little bit foreshadowing --\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nthis is from before Dean dropped out.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nBut the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nwe show you relevant ads.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nAnd this is hard to read, but this says \"Battle for New Hampshire:\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nHoward Dean for President\" -- articles on Howard Dean.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nAnd these ads are generated automatically --\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nlike in this case, on the Washington Post --\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nfrom the content on the site.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nAnd so we use our over 150,000 advertisers\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand millions of advertisements, so we pick the one\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nthat's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nmuch as we do on search.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nSo the idea is we can make advertising useful,\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nnot just annoying, right?\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nAnd the nice thing about this,\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nwe have a self-serve program,\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand many thousands of websites have signed up,\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nand this let's them really make money. And I --\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nyou know, there's a number of people I met --\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nI met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nand he said, \"You know, I wasn't making any money.\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nI just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nAnd, you know, thank you.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nI don't have to do my other job now.\"\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nIt makes content get better, it makes searching work better,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nwhen people can really make their livelihood\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nfrom producing great content.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nSo this session is supposed to be about the future,\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nso I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nAnd the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nyou really have to be smart.\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nBecause you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nand you expect an answer back, right?\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nBut finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\nIt would be artificial intelligence.\n\n00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nAnd so that's something we work on,\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nand we even have some people who are excited enough\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:04.958\nand crazy enough to work on it now,\n\n00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand that's really their goal.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:08.958\nSo we always hope that Google will be smart,\n\n00:17:08.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nbut we're always surprised when other people think that it is.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:14.958\nAnd so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.\n\n00:17:14.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nThis is a blog from Iraq,\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand it's not really what\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nI'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nMaybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nSo we decided --\n\n00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nactually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nSo, \"related searches,\" right there. You can't see it that well,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nbut we decided we should put in this feature\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\ninto our AdSense ads, called \"related searches.\"\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nAnd so we'd say, you know, \"Did you mean 'search for'\" -- what is this,\n\n00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:49.958\nin this case, \"Saddam Hussein,\" because this blog is about Iraq --\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:51.958\nand you know, in addition to the ads,\n\n00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nand we thought this would be a great idea.\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:56.958\nAnd so there is this blog\n\n00:17:56.958 --> 00:18:01.958\nof a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,\n\n00:18:01.958 --> 00:18:03.958\n\"You know, I'm sleeping a lot.\"\n\n00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nHe was just kind of writing about his life.\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:08.958\nAnd our algorithms -- not a person, of course,\n\n00:18:08.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nbut our algorithms, our computers --\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nread his blog and decided that\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nthe related search was, \"I am bored.\"\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nAnd he read this, and he thought a person had decided\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nthat he was boring,\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.958\nand it was very unfortunate,\n\n00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nand he said, \"You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:28.958\nWhy don't they like my blog?\"\n\n00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nAnd so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,\n\n00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:34.958\nsort of going from bad to worse,\n\n00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:36.958\nand we said the related search was, \"Retards.\"\n\n00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:41.958\nAnd then, you know, he got even more mad,\n\n00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.958\nand he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.\n\n00:18:43.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nAnd then we produced \"You suck.\"\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:49.958\nAnd finally, it ended with \"Kiss my ass.\"\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nAnd so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nand of course, you know,\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nwe just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:00.958\nand it didn't quite work,\n\n00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nand we don't have this feature anymore.\n\n00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nI wanted to end just by saying that\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:11.958\nthere's a couple things that really make me excited\n\n00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nto be involved with Google,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:18.958\nand one of those is that we're able to make money\n\n00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:21.958\nlargely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that\n\n00:19:21.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nwas that we're able to serve everyone in the world\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:29.958\nwithout worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:32.958\nSo we don't have to worry about our products being sold,\n\n00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:35.958\nfor example, for less money in places that are poor,\n\n00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:37.958\nand then they get re-imported into the U.S. --\n\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nfor example, with the drug industry.\n\n00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nAnd I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nbecause everyone in the world has access to our search,\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nand I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:51.958\nThe other thing I wanted to mention just briefly\n\n00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:57.958\nis that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility\n\n00:19:57.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nto provide people the right information,\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:02.958\nand we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --\n\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:05.958\nthat we should provide very objective information.\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.958\nAnd so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.\n\n00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nWe accept payment for advertising,\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nand we mark it as such.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.958\nAnd that's unlike many of our competitors.\n\n00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:18.958\nAnd I think decisions we're able to make like that\n\n00:20:18.958 --> 00:20:20.958\nhave a tremendous impact on the world,\n\n00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:22.958\nand it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.\n\n00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nSo thank you."}, {"title": "\"Black Men Ski\"", "duration": "277", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/stew_says_black_men_ski", "transcript": "Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado?

ghastly tragedy of the suburbs", "duration": "1184", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia", "transcript": "The immersive ugliness of our everyday environments in America is entropy made visible. We can't overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this. And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America. By the way, this doesn't help. Nobody's having a better day down here because of that.There are a lot of ways you can describe this. You know, I like to call it \"the national automobile slum.\" You can call it suburban sprawl. I think it's appropriate to call it the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck. And it's a tremendous problem for us. The outstanding \u2014 the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about. We're going to talk about that some more. A sense of place: your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings, and to employ the vocabularies, grammars, syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are.The public realm in America has two roles: it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life, and it is the physical manifestation of the common good. And when you degrade the public realm, you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there. The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas and market squares of older cultures. And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design. This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it. And consequently, we can see the result all around us. The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically, but it has to inform us where we are in our culture. Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to, by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present. And if there is one tremendous \u2014 if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built, the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years, it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these. You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town. And remember, to create a place of character and quality, you have to be able to define space. So how is that being accomplished here? If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here and try to look at the Target store over here, you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter) That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space. Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in. These will be places that are not worth caring about.We have about, you know, 38,000 places that are not worth caring about in the United States today. When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending. And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq, spilling their blood in the sand, and ask yourself, \"What is their last thought of home?\" I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause) We need better places in this country.Public space. This is a good public space. It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined. It is emphatically an outdoor public room. It has something that is terribly important \u2014 it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge. That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations \u2014 things go in and out of it. It's permeable. The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out, and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in. You know, in these places in other cultures, people just go there voluntarily because they like them. We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter) You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival. People just go because it's pleasurable to be there. But this is how we do it in the United States.Probably the most significant public space failure in America, designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei: Boston City Hall Plaza. A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter) And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive, and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it. And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.This is the other side of the building. This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that. It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this, but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block. This is the back of Boston City Hall, the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany \u2014 excuse me \u2014 in Boston. And what is the message that is coming, what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building and how is it informing us about who we are?This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building, because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us. You know, that it's a despotic building; it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter) This is it on a smaller scale: the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York. By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town, they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter) and they shouted at me and said, \"It was raining that day when you took that picture!\" Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter) Audio jack, power supply \u2014 and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right? You know, we hire firms to design these things. You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting. You know, eight hours before deadline, four architects trying to get this building in on time, right? And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and \u2014 I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter) Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting. It was: \"Fuck it.\" (Laughter) (Applause)That \u2014 that is the message of this form of architecture. The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck. So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to \u2014 you know \u2014 do some reality testing, and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter) it's not interesting enough for his clients, you know, the burglars, the muggers. It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there. OK.The pattern of Main Street USA \u2014 in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal. It's not that complicated: buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge, so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building. Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs, you know, apartments, offices, and so on. You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor. They haven't learned that in Monterey. If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center, you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner. It's really incredible.Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building, and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York, when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right? So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty. OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk, where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter) Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition. Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed, we pop a handicapped ramp on that, and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it. And that's how we do it. I call them \"nature Band-Aids\" because there's a general idea in America that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature. And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings. Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. You know, that's not good enough. We have to do good buildings.The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it: To spatially denote the pedestrian realm, to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway, to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk, and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling \u2014 a vaulted ceiling \u2014 over the street, at its best. And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees. They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods; they're not supposed to be a set for \"The Last of the Mohicans.\"You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural. They're not the same thing. And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city, which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time. Here you see it on a small scale \u2014 the mothership has landed, R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city, city life, and everything connected with it. And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century, is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city, which is going to be life in the country for everybody. And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb: the country villa along the railroad line, which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city, but to return to the countryside every night. And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then, so it really was a form of country living.But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years and it turns into something rather insidious. It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country. And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule. Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know. Basically, a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state, emphatically, \"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me. I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.\" So you have this one last facade of the house, the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house. Because \u2014 notice the porch here. Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that. This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called \"We're Normal.\" We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal. Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.But we know what's going on in these houses, you know. We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here, getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter) We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old, is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit. Because these places, these habitats, are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children, and they don't have a lot of experience with medication. So they take the first one that comes along, often. These are not good enough for Americans. These are the schools we are sending them to: The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada. This is a real school! You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out, that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver. So every effort is made to keep them within the building. Notice that nature is present. (Laughter)We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not. We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and \u2014 certainly in America \u2014 the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era. It is going to change absolutely everything. Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't, except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy. Forget it. It's not going to happen. We're going to have to do something else instead. We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it. We're going to have \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 we're going to have to live closer to where we work. We're going to have to live closer to each other. We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live. The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end. We're going to have to \u2014 we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of! We gotta do better than that!And we should have started two days before yesterday. We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years, excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents' generation after World War II. Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns. We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral, that allow \u2014 that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.So that, you know, the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance. We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are: the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small, the courtyard, the civic square and how to really make use of this property. We can see some of the first ideas for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America. The dead malls: what are we going to do with them? Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it. They're not going to be retro-fitted; they're going to be the salvage yards of the future.Some of them we're going to fix, though. And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development. And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities. And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were because they occupy all the important sites. And most of them are still going to be there, although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.We've got a lot of work to do. We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels. No amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it. We're going to have to do everything very differently. And America's not prepared. We are sleepwalking into the future. We're not ready for what's coming at us. So I urge you all to do what you can. Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally. Be prepared to be good neighbors. Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.One final thing \u2014 I've been very disturbed about this for years, but I think it's particularly important for this audience. Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as \"consumers.\" OK? Consumers are different than citizens. Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties to their fellow human beings. And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion, you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having. And we're going to continue being clueless going into this very difficult future that we face. So thank you very much. Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about and a nation that will be worth defending.

It's permeable.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nThe beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nand that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nYou know, in these places in other cultures,\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\npeople just go there voluntarily because they like them.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nWe don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nYou know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nPeople just go because it's pleasurable to be there.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nBut this is how we do it in the United States.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nProbably the most significant public space failure in America,\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:11.958\ndesigned by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nBoston City Hall Plaza.\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nA public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nAnd we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nThis is the other side of the building.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nThis was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nIt wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbut there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nThis is the back of Boston City Hall,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthe most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd what is the message that is coming,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.958\nwhat are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nand how is it informing us about who we are?\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nThis, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nof Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nand all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nbecause then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nYou know, that it's a despotic building;\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nit wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nThis is it on a smaller scale:\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:40.958\nthe back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nBy the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nthey all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nand they shouted at me and said,\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n\"It was raining that day when you took that picture!\"\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nBecause this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nYou know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nAudio jack, power supply --\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nYou know, we hire firms to design these things.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nYou can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nYou know, eight hours before deadline,\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nfour architects trying to get this building in on time, right?\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nAnd they're sitting there at the long boardroom table\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nwith all the drawings, and the renderings,\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nand all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nI mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nBecause you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nIt was: \"Fuck it.\" (Laughter) (Applause)\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThat -- that is the message of this form of architecture.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nThe message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nSo I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nyou know -- do some reality testing,\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nand in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nit's not interesting enough for his clients,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nyou know, the burglars, the muggers.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nIt's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nOK.\n\n00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nThe pattern of Main Street USA --\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nin fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nIt's not that complicated:\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nbuildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nso that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nOther activities are allowed to occur upstairs,\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nyou know, apartments, offices, and so on.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nYou make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nThey haven't learned that in Monterey.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nIf you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nyou'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nIt's really incredible.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nAnyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nand this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nwhen we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nSo the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nOK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nwhere the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nOf course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nThen because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nwe pop a handicapped ramp on that,\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nand then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAnd that's how we do it.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nI call them \"nature Band-Aids\" because there's a general idea in America\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthat the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nAnd in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:19.958\nNot just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nYou know, that's not good enough.\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nWe have to do good buildings.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nThe street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nTo spatially denote the pedestrian realm,\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nto protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nto filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nand to soften the hardscape of the buildings\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nand to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nAnd that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nThey're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nthey're not supposed to be a set for \"The Last of the Mohicans.\"\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nYou know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nof the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThey're not the same thing.\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nAnd we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,\n\n00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nwhich is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nHere you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed,\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nR2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nto see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nA lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nthat we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.958\ncity life, and everything connected with it.\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nAnd so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nis this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nwhich is going to be life in the country for everybody.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthe country villa along the railroad line,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nwhich allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nbut to return to the countryside every night.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nAnd believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nso it really was a form of country living.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nBut what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nand it turns into something rather insidious.\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nIt becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nand one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nBecause it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:36.958\nAnd these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.\n\n00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nBasically, a house with nothing on the side\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nbecause this house wants to state, emphatically,\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:44.958\n\"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.958\nI don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see.\"\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nSo you have this one last facade of the house,\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthe front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nBecause -- notice the porch here.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nUnless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nThis is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called \"We're Normal.\"\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nWe're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nPlease respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nBut we know what's going on in these houses, you know.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.958\ngetting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nWe know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nis turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nBecause these places, these habitats,\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nare inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nand they don't have a lot of experience with medication.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nSo they take the first one that comes along, often.\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nThese are not good enough for Americans.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nThese are the schools we are sending them to:\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nThe Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nThis is a real school!\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nYou know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nSo every effort is made to keep them within the building.\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nNotice that nature is present. (Laughter)\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nWe're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nWe are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:28.958\n-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nIt is going to change absolutely everything.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nChris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nexcept to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nForget it. It's not going to happen.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nWe're going to have to do something else instead.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nWe're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nvirtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:55.958\nWe're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.\n\n00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nWe're going to have to live closer to each other.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nWe're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:06.958\nThe age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:11.958\nWe're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!\n\n00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nWe gotta do better than that!\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nAnd we should have started two days before yesterday.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nWe are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nexcavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nby our parents' generation after World War II.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nBecause we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nWe're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nin order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:49.958\nthat allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life\n\n00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nand our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nSo that, you know, the residences make sense\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:02.958\ndeployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nWe're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:12.958\nthe street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,\n\n00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nthe courtyard, the civic square\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nand how to really make use of this property.\n\n00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.958\nWe can see some of the first ideas\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nfor retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nThe dead malls: what are we going to do with them?\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nWell, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:33.958\nThey're not going to be retro-fitted;\n\n00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nthey're going to be the salvage yards of the future.\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.958\nSome of them we're going to fix, though.\n\n00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nAnd we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:46.958\nand returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nAnd if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nin our existing towns and cities.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nAnd by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nbecause they occupy all the important sites.\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:05.958\nAnd most of them are still going to be there,\n\n00:18:05.958 --> 00:18:10.958\nalthough the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.958\nWe've got a lot of work to do.\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:17.958\nWe're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.\n\n00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:20.958\nNo amount or combination of alternative fuels\n\n00:18:20.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nis going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:27.958\nWe're going to have to do everything very differently.\n\n00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:29.958\nAnd America's not prepared.\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nWe are sleepwalking into the future.\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nWe're not ready for what's coming at us.\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:38.958\nSo I urge you all to do what you can.\n\n00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:45.958\nLife in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.958\nBe prepared to be good neighbors.\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nBe prepared to find vocations that make you useful\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:55.958\nto your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.\n\n00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.958\nOne final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years,\n\n00:18:58.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nbut I think it's particularly important for this audience.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nPlease, please, stop referring to yourselves as \"consumers.\" OK?\n\n00:19:07.958 --> 00:19:09.958\nConsumers are different than citizens.\n\n00:19:09.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nConsumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.958\nto their fellow human beings.\n\n00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.958\nAnd as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,\n\n00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nyou will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:26.958\nAnd we're going to continue being clueless\n\n00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:29.958\ngoing into this very difficult future that we face.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:30.958\nSo thank you very much.\n\n00:19:30.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nPlease go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:39.958\nand a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)"}, {"title": "Human-centered design", "duration": "1020", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_kelley_on_human_centered_design", "transcript": "There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world and at IDEO this past year, and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984 but I've been to a lot of them since that time. I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard; it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.And so thinking back, I was thinking those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects \u2014 certainly technological objects. And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you who are in the audience were my clients. We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth and we'd put it on the conference table, and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would \"ooh\" and \"ah.\" That was a really good time.And so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have. And if you were here last year, I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2, which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring. And I took a lot of pictures last year; very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures. This year \u2014 maybe you could show the slides \u2014 this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with and helped Handspring design it. Also, though we designed it a few years ago \u2014 it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so \u2014 this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives. Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now. Lots of lives are being saved by those. And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read. So, we really will continue to focus on products.But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED, and that's that people like us \u2014 I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time, but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit \u2014 and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design, human-centeredness in an approach to design. That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products. And I think you're starting to see that, and it's making our job even more enjoyable.Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models \u2014 you know, you've seen some today \u2014 and 3-D renderings. Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas. But firms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion, showing how they'll be used. And so in order to do that we've been forming internal video-production groups in order to make these kind of experience prototypes that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship. And it's a much better way to see. It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses, as opposed to them being empty.So I thought that I would show you a few videos to show off this new, broader definition of design in products and services and environments. I have a few of them \u2014 they're no more than a minute or a minute-and-a-half apiece \u2014 but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year, and how it responds in video.So, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas and OMA to help us conceive the technology that's in their retail store in New York. He wanted a new kind of store \u2014 a new one \u2014 a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one. And that meant actually designing custom technology as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags: there's RF tags on the user, on the cards, there's the staff devices that are all around the store. You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in, the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store. You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever. And so then the object \u2014 the merchandise that you're interested in \u2014 can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room, and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room. We can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that, and get more information about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on. It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here of liquid crystal displays in the changing room.The last time I went to see this store, there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering, \"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?\" But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark. So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing. And then one of my favorite features of the technology is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes. There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around \u2014 but there's a three second delay. So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look. (Applause)About a year and a half ago we were asked to design an installation in the museum \u2014 this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London, and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues. And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO, designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall. I don't know if anybody's seen this \u2014 it's pretty spectacular in the room.Anyway, it's based on the London subway system. And so you can see that the goal is to bring some of the feedback that the people who had gone to the museum were giving, and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see. So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system, the little trains go around with what you're thinking about. And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor \u2014 mostly teenagers coming out of there \u2014 there's this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun, also designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch. And the topics include things that the museum is about: male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby or what a driverless car might be like. There's lots of room, so people can come up and understand what it is before they get involved.And also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful. They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top, after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits and go off into the atmosphere.The next video is not done by us. This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago. Scott Adams ran into us and asked us if we wouldn't help to design the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert, which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up. He's always been interested in technology in the future.(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles. So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together with some of the smartest design guys in the world and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge, the team built their own little cubicles to fully experience the problems.Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.Narrator: They took pictures.Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over and you're sort of held captive there for a minute.SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good. We'll see what happens.Narrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens for the computer and for family photos. In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive and actually give Dilbert a group hug. (Laughter) Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting that follows the sun across \u2014 that follows the tracks of the sun \u2014 across the sky. So you feel that in your cubicle. And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase that wilts when you leave in disappointment, and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls, or something to be aggressive with to release tension.(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle.(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London. The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it, as well as wastewater. So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time.The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful. In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's kind of wild and crazy and everybody's learning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing. But it was intended to be quite quiet. And then you would wander around and gather information, in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water once it comes through the plant. And then, if you saw, the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water. You can see: there's the plant. These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.And we're announcing a new product here tonight, which is the first time this has ever been shown in public. It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye, started by Nigel Jagger in London. And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience \u2014 many people have boats, or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there, and enjoying what scuba divers do. This product, it has two cameras. You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.For us \u2014 there's the object \u2014 for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface so that the interface doesn't get in your way. You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater \u2014 of feeling like you're underwater \u2014 seeing what's going on. And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool. And so we spent a lot of time \u2014 this has been going on for about seven or eight years, this project \u2014 and [we're] just ready to start building them.(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera. It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate, and is equipped with powerful lights. It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep. The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together. Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control. You watch the video with superimposed graphics that indicate your depth and compass heading. The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself underwater.) (Applause)DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC, which is a project that I'm very excited about. ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher, who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford. He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright and he had a very interesting insight, which is that he said, \"There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya; there must be entrepreneurs everywhere.\" And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there they could find enough money to put something together. So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya with Kenyan manufacturers \u2014 designed by people like us, but taken there. And to this date \u2014 he's been gone for only a few years \u2014 he's started 19,000 companies. He's made 30,000 new jobs. And just the sales of the products \u2014 this is a non-profit \u2014 the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya. This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.So we're in the process of helping them design deep-well, low-cost manual pumps in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land to be able to grow crops in the off-season. What they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season but they can't grow them in the off-season. And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing \u2014 she's a school teacher \u2014 always wanted to send her kids to college and she's going to be able to do it because of these things. So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and very straightforward things that we're designing \u2014 my students are doing this as class projects and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work \u2014 it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.We also were thinking about the experience of Richard, and so \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say. (Laughter) Can you read it? (Laughter) Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers. You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty, and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here. (Laughter) (Applause)So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session, and from all the different presenters. And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC, it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design, that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do, and I think this is great. Designers are more trusted and more integrated into the business strategy of companies, and I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design has made since the first TED.

Thank you very much, Richard;\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nit's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:40.958\nAnd so thinking back, I was thinking\n\n00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nthose of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.958\ncertainly technological objects.\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nAnd so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nwho are in the audience were my clients.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nWe'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nand we'd put it on the conference table,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:05.958\nand we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would \"ooh\" and \"ah.\"\n\n00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nThat was a really good time.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:11.958\nAnd so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.\n\n00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.958\nAnd if you were here last year,\n\n00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nI probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:24.958\nwhich was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nAnd I took a lot of pictures last year;\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nvery few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nThis year -- maybe you could show the slides --\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthis year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nand helped Handspring design it.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nAlso, though we designed it a few years ago --\n\n00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nit's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nthis Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nMaybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nLots of lives are being saved by those.\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:57.958\nAnd, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nthat I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.958\nSo, we really will continue to focus on products.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nBut something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nand that's that people like us --\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nI know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,\n\n00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nbut for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nclimbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit --\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:26.958\nand so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,\n\n00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nhuman-centeredness in an approach to design.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nThat really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nAnd I think you're starting to see that,\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nand it's making our job even more enjoyable.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nInterestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models --\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nyou know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.958\nThen we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nBut firms like ours are having to move to a point where\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nwe get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nshowing how they'll be used.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nAnd so in order to do that we've been forming\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\ninternal video-production groups\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nin order to make these kind of experience prototypes\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd it's a much better way to see.\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nIt's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nas opposed to them being empty.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nSo I thought that I would show you a few videos\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nto show off this new, broader definition\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nof design in products and services and environments.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nor a minute-and-a-half apiece --\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nbut I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nwork over the last year, and how it responds in video.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nSo, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nand OMA to help us conceive the technology\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nthat's in their retail store in New York.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nHe wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.958\na store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd that meant actually designing custom technology\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nas opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nSo, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nthere's RF tags on the user, on the cards,\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthere's the staff devices that are all around the store.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nYou pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nthe staff person can scan them in\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nand then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.\n\n00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nYou can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nAnd so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\ncan be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand in the dressing room there are scanners\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nso that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nWe can put that up on a touch screen\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nand you can play with that, and get more information\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nabout the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nIt's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.958\nof liquid crystal displays in the changing room.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nThe last time I went to see this store,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nthere was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.958\n\"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?\"\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nBut if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nSo you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nAnd then one of my favorite features of the technology\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nis the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nThere's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nbut there's a three second delay.\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nSo you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:54.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nAbout a year and a half ago we were asked to design\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nan installation in the museum --\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nthis is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nAnd a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,\n\n00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:32.958\ndesigned this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nI don't know if anybody's seen this --\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nit's pretty spectacular in the room.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnyway, it's based on the London subway system.\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nAnd so you can see that\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nthe goal is to bring some of the feedback\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nthat the people who had gone to the museum were giving,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nand get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nSo you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthe little trains go around with what you're thinking about.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThen when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor --\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nmostly teenagers coming out of there --\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nthere's this big open space that has these tables in it\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat have interactive games which are quite fun,\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nalso designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nAnd the topics include things that the museum is about:\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nmale fertility, choosing the sex of your baby\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nor what a driverless car might be like.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nThere's lots of room, so people can come up\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.958\nand understand what it is before they get involved.\n\n00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nAnd also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nThey go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nafter they've bounced around, they disperse into bits\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nand go off into the atmosphere.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nThe next video is not done by us.\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nThis is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nScott Adams ran into us\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nand asked us if we wouldn't help to design\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:02.958\nthe ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,\n\n00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.958\nwhich sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nHe's always been interested in technology in the future.\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.958\n(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nthe world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nSo we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwith some of the smartest design guys in the world\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:21.958\nand try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNarrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nspectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nthe team built their own little cubicles\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nto fully experience the problems.\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nWoman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nNarrator: They took pictures.\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nWoman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nand you're sort of held captive there for a minute.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nSA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nWe'll see what happens.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nNarrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nfor the computer and for family photos.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nIn the second group's scenario, the walls are alive\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nand actually give Dilbert a group hug.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nBehind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nDavid Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nSo you feel that in your cubicle.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nAnd my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nthat wilts when you leave in disappointment,\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nand then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\n(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:38.958\nDK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,\n\n00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nor something to be aggressive with to release tension.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.958\n(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nDK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nthat stretches across your cubicle.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958\n(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nDK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthe recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nThe dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nas well as wastewater.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nSo this building actually celebrates the water\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nas it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nso that it can be filtered for the final time.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThe pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nIn contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nkind of wild and crazy and everybody's\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nlearning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nBut it was intended to be quite quiet.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nAnd then you would wander around and gather information,\n\n00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nin a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nand what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nonce it comes through the plant.\n\n00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nAnd then, if you saw,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nthe panels actually rotate. So you can get the information\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.958\non the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nrecycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nYou can see: there's the plant.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nThese are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nAnd we're announcing a new product here tonight,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nwhich is the first time this has ever been shown in public.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nIt's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nstarted by Nigel Jagger in London.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nAnd it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nor enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nactually have the capability or the interest in going under the water\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.958\nand actually seeing what's there,\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nand enjoying what scuba divers do.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nThis product, it has two cameras.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nYou throw it over the side of your boat\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nand you basically scuba dive without getting wet.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nFor us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nso that the interface doesn't get in your way.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nYou could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nof feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nAnd the other one was to design the object\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:39.958\nAnd so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about\n\n00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nseven or eight years, this project --\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nand [we're] just ready to start building them.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.958\n(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:54.958\nIt can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,\n\n00:12:54.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nand is equipped with powerful lights.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nIt becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nThe battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nDK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nand it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\n(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nManeuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nYou watch the video with superimposed graphics\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nthat indicate your depth and compass heading.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThe fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:29.958\nto help you completely lose yourself underwater.)\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:56.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nDK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nwhich is a project that I'm very excited about.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nwho's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nHe found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nand he had a very interesting insight, which is that\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nhe said, \"There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nthere must be entrepreneurs everywhere.\"\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nAnd he noticed that for weddings and funerals there\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.958\nthey could find enough money to put something together.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nSo he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:34.958\nwith Kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us, but taken there.\n\n00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nAnd to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nhe's started 19,000 companies.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nHe's made 30,000 new jobs.\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nAnd just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nthe sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nThis is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nSo we're in the process of helping them design\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\ndeep-well, low-cost manual pumps\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nin order for these people who have a quarter acre of land\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nto be able to grow crops in the off-season.\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nWhat they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nbut they can't grow them in the off-season.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nshe's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.958\nand she's going to be able to do it because of these things.\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.958\nSo with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and\n\n00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:31.958\nvery straightforward things that we're designing --\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.958\nmy students are doing this as class projects\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nit's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:45.958\nWe also were thinking about the experience of Richard,\n\n00:15:45.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nand so --\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:52.958\n-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nand I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:59.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nCan you read it?\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:02.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nWell, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nYou know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nand so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:13.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:21.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nSo we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nand from all the different presenters.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nAnd in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nit's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nthat we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nand I think this is great.\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nDesigners are more trusted and more integrated\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\ninto the business strategy of companies,\n\n00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nand I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nhas made since the first TED.

And here's the unromantic truth \u2014 and the city air makes you free, they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule. And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty. They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can. They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers. They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai. They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps. Education is the main event that can happen in cities. What's going on in the street in Mumbai? Al Gore knows. It's basically everything. There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works. One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.So here's the first punch line: cities have defused the population bomb.And here's the second punch line.

Well, villages of the world are emptying out.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nThe question is, why?\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.958\nAnd here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,\n\n00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthey said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nlike Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nAnd these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nThey're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nThey're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThey have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:23.958\nOne-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nThey are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nEducation is the main event that can happen in cities.\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nWhat's going on in the street in Mumbai?\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nAl Gore knows. It's basically everything.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.958\nThere's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nOne-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nSo here's the first punch line:\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:05.958\ncities have defused the population bomb.\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nAnd here's the second punch line.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:13.958\nThat's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nStars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.958\nNow we're shining right back up.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:02:59.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "How brain science will change computing", "duration": "1211", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing", "transcript": "I do two things: I design mobile computers and I study brains. Today's talk is about brains and \u2014 (Audience member cheers) Yay! I have a brain fan out there.(Laughter) If I could have my first slide, you'll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations. So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory, why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it. I'll try to do all that in 20 minutes. I have two affiliations. Most of you know me from my Palm and Handspring days, but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park. We study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works. I'm going to talk all about that.I have one slide on my other life, the computer life, and that's this slide here. These are some of the products I've worked on over the last 20 years, starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet computers and so on, ending up most recently with the Treo, and we're continuing to do this. I've done this because I believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing, and I'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things. But this was, I admit, all an accident. I really didn't want to do any of these products. Very early in my career I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry.Before that, I just have to tell you about this picture of Graffiti I picked off the web the other day. I was looking for a picture for Graffiti that'll text input language. I found a website dedicated to teachers who want to make script-writing things across the top of their blackboard, and they had added Graffiti to it, and I'm sorry about that.(Laughter)So what happened was, when I was young and got out of engineering school at Cornell in '79, I went to work for Intel and was in the computer industry, and three months into that, I fell in love with something else. I said, \"I made the wrong career choice here,\" and I fell in love with brains. This is not a real brain. This is a picture of one, a line drawing. And I don't remember exactly how it happened, but I have one recollection, which was pretty strong in my mind. In September of 1979, Scientific American came out with a single-topic issue about the brain. It was one of their best issues ever. They talked about the neuron, development, disease, vision and all the things you might want to know about brains. It was really quite impressive.One might've had the impression we knew a lot about brains. But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame. Today is, I think, the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And he wrote a story basically saying, this is all well and good, but you know, we don't know diddly squat about brains, and no one has a clue how they work, so don't believe what anyone tells you. This is a quote from that article, he says: \"What is conspicuously lacking\" \u2014 he's a very proper British gentleman \u2014 \"What is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches.\" I thought the word \"framework\" was great. He didn't say we didn't have a theory. He says we don't even know how to begin to think about it. We don't even have a framework. We are in the pre-paradigm days, if you want to use Thomas Kuhn. So I fell in love with this. I said, look: We have all this knowledge about brains \u2014 how hard can it be? It's something we can work on in my lifetime; I could make a difference. So I tried to get out of the computer business, into the brain business.First, I went to MIT, the AI lab was there. I said, I want to build intelligent machines too, but I want to study how brains work first. And they said, \"Oh, you don't need to do that. You're just going to program computers, that's all. I said, you really ought to study brains. They said, \"No, you're wrong.\" I said, \"No, you're wrong,\" and I didn't get in.(Laughter)I was a little disappointed \u2014 pretty young \u2014 but I went back again a few years later, this time in California, and I went to Berkeley. And I said, I'll go in from the biological side. So I got in the PhD program in biophysics. I was like, I'm studying brains now. Well, I want to study theory. They said, \"You can't study theory about brains. You can't get funded for that. And as a graduate student, you can't do that.\" So I said, oh my gosh. I was depressed; I said, but I can make a difference in this field. I went back in the computer industry and said, I'll have to work here for a while. That's when I designed all those computer products.(Laughter)I said, I want to do this for four years, make some money, I was having a family, and I would mature a bit, and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit. Well, it took longer than four years. It's been about 16 years. But I'm doing it now, and I'm going to tell you about it. So why should we have a good brain theory? Well, there's lots of reasons people do science. The most basic one is, people like to know things. We're curious, and we go out and get knowledge. Why do we study ants? It's interesting. Maybe we'll learn something useful, but it's interesting and fascinating. But sometimes a science has other attributes which makes it really interesting.Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves; it'll tell us who we are. Evolution did this and Copernicus did this, where we have a new understanding of who we are. And after all, we are our brains. My brain is talking to your brain. Our bodies are hanging along for the ride, but my brain is talking to your brain. And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive, we need to understand brains. Another thing is sometimes science leads to big societal benefits, technologies, or businesses or whatever. This is one, too, because when we understand how brains work, we'll be able to build intelligent machines. That's a good thing on the whole, with tremendous benefits to society, just like a fundamental technology.So why don't we have a good theory of brains? People have been working on it for 100 years. Let's first take a look at what normal science looks like. This is normal science. Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists. The theorist guy says, \"I think this is what's going on,\" the experimentalist says, \"You're wrong.\" It goes back and forth, this works in physics, this in geology. But if this is normal science, what does neuroscience look like? This is what neuroscience looks like. We have this mountain of data, which is anatomy, physiology and behavior. You can't imagine how much detail we know about brains. There were 28,000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year, and every one of them is doing research in brains. A lot of data, but no theory. There's a little wimpy box on top there.And theory has not played a role in any sort of grand way in the neurosciences. And it's a real shame. Now, why has this come about? If you ask neuroscientists why is this the state of affairs, first, they'll admit it. But if you ask them, they say, there's various reasons we don't have a good brain theory. Some say we still don't have enough data, we need more information, there's all these things we don't know. Well, I just told you there's data coming out of your ears. We have so much information, we don't even know how to organize it. What good is more going to do? Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing, but I don't think so. This is a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory. We don't need more data, we need a good theory.Another one is sometimes people say, \"Brains are so complex, it'll take another 50 years.\" I even think Chris said something like this yesterday, something like, it's one of the most complicated things in the universe. That's not true \u2014 you're more complicated than your brain. You've got a brain. And although the brain looks very complicated, things look complicated until you understand them. That's always been the case. So we can say, my neocortex, the part of the brain I'm interested in, has 30 billion cells. But, you know what? It's very, very regular. In fact, it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over again. It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue.Some people say, brains can't understand brains. Very Zen-like. Woo.(Laughter)You know, it sounds good, but why? I mean, what's the point? It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver. It's got a lot of cells in it too, right? So, you know, I don't think there's anything to that. And finally, some people say, \"I don't feel like a bunch of cells \u2014 I'm conscious. I've got this experience, I'm in the world. I can't be just a bunch of cells.\" Well, people used to believe there was a life force to be living, and we now know that's really not true at all. And there's really no evidence, other than that people just disbelieve that cells can do what they do. So some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism, some really smart people, too, but we can reject all that.(Laughter)No, there's something else, something really fundamental, and it is: another reason why we don't have a good brain theory is because we have an intuitive, strongly held but incorrect assumption that has prevented us from seeing the answer. There's something we believe that just, it's obvious, but it's wrong. Now, there's a history of this in science and before I tell you what it is, I'll tell you about the history of it in science. Look at other scientific revolutions \u2014 the solar system, that's Copernicus, Darwin's evolution, and tectonic plates, that's Wegener. They all have a lot in common with brain science.First, they had a lot of unexplained data. A lot of it. But it got more manageable once they had a theory. The best minds were stumped \u2014 really smart people. We're not smarter now than they were then; it just turns out it's really hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them, it's easy to understand. My daughters understood these three theories, in their basic framework, in kindergarten. It's not that hard \u2014 here's the apple, here's the orange, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.Another thing is the answer was there all along, but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing. It was an intuitive, strongly held belief that was wrong. In the case of the solar system, the idea that the Earth is spinning, the surface is going a thousand miles an hour, and it's going through the solar system at a million miles an hour \u2014 this is lunacy; we all know the Earth isn't moving. Do you feel like you're moving a thousand miles an hour? If you said Earth was spinning around in space and was huge \u2014 they would lock you up, that's what they did back then. So it was intuitive and obvious. Now, what about evolution?Evolution, same thing. We taught our kids the Bible says God created all these species, cats are cats; dogs are dogs; people are people; plants are plants; they don't change. Noah put them on the ark in that order, blah, blah. The fact is, if you believe in evolution, we all have a common ancestor. We all have a common ancestor with the plant in the lobby! This is what evolution tells us. And it's true. It's kind of unbelievable. And the same thing about tectonic plates. All the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top of the Earth. It doesn't make any sense.So what is the intuitive, but incorrect assumption, that's kept us from understanding brains? I'll tell you. It'll seem obvious that it's correct. That's the point. Then I'll make an argument why you're incorrect on the other assumption. The intuitive but obvious thing is: somehow, intelligence is defined by behavior; we're intelligent because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently. And I'm going to tell you that's wrong. Intelligence is defined by prediction.I'm going to work you through this in a few slides, and give you an example of what this means. Here's a system. Engineers and scientists like to look at systems like this. They say, we have a thing in a box. We have its inputs and outputs. The AI people said, the thing in the box is a programmable computer, because it's equivalent to a brain. We'll feed it some inputs and get it to do something, have some behavior. Alan Turing defined the Turing test, which essentially says, we'll know if something's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human \u2014 a behavioral metric of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds for a long time.Reality, though \u2014 I call it real intelligence. Real intelligence is built on something else. We experience the world through a sequence of patterns, and we store them, and we recall them. When we recall them, we match them up against reality, and we're making predictions all the time. It's an internal metric; there's an internal metric about us, saying, do we understand the world, am I making predictions, and so on. You're all being intelligent now, but you're not doing anything. Maybe you're scratching yourself, but you're not doing anything. But you're being intelligent; you're understanding what I'm saying. Because you're intelligent and you speak English, you know the word at the end of this sentence.The word came to you; you make these predictions all the time. What I'm saying is, the internal prediction is the output in the neocortex, and somehow, prediction leads to intelligent behavior. Here's how that happens: Let's start with a non-intelligent brain. I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we'll call it an old brain. And we'll say it's a non-mammal, like a reptile, say, an alligator; we have an alligator. And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses. It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior. It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you. It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff. But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent, not in a human sort of way.But it has all this complex behavior already. Now in evolution, what happened? First thing that happened in evolution with mammals is we started to develop a thing called the neocortex. I'm going to represent the neocortex by this box on top of the old brain. Neocortex means \"new layer.\" It's a new layer on top of your brain. It's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit.(Laughter)Literally, it's about the size of a table napkin and doesn't fit, so it's wrinkly. Now, look at how I've drawn this. The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain. You do. It's your emotional brain. It's all those gut reactions you have. On top of it, we have this memory system called the neocortex. And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain. So as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing. It's sitting there saying, I'm going to memorize all the things going on: where I've been, people I've seen, things I've heard, and so on. And in the future, when it sees something similar to that again, in a similar environment, or the exact same environment, it'll start playing it back: \"Oh, I've been here before,\" and when you were here before, this happened next. It allows you to predict the future. It literally feeds back the signals into your brain; they'll let you see what's going to happen next, will let you hear the word \"sentence\" before I said it. And it's this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions.This is the most important slide of my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little. And all the time you say, \"Oh, I can predict things,\" so if you're a rat and you go through a maze, and you learn the maze, next time you're in one, you have the same behavior. But suddenly, you're smarter; you say, \"I recognize this maze, I know which way to go; I've been here before; I can envision the future.\" That's what it's doing. This is true for all mammals \u2014 in humans, it got a lot worse. Humans actually developed the front of the neocortex, called the anterior part of the neocortex. And nature did a little trick. It copied the posterior, the back part, which is sensory, and put it in the front. Humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front, but we use it for motor control.So we're now able to do very sophisticated motor planning, things like that. I don't have time to explain, but to understand how a brain works, you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works, how it is we store patterns and make predictions. Let me give you a few examples of predictions. I already said the word \"sentence.\" In music, if you've heard a song before, when you hear it, the next note pops into your head already \u2014 you anticipate it. With an album, at the end of a song, the next song pops into your head. It happens all the time, you make predictions.I have this thing called the \"altered door\" thought experiment. It says, you have a door at home; when you're here, I'm changing it \u2014 I've got a guy back at your house right now, moving the door around, moving your doorknob over two inches. When you go home tonight, you'll put your hand out, reach for the doorknob, notice it's in the wrong spot and go, \"Whoa, something happened.\" It may take a second, but something happened. I can change your doorknob in other ways \u2014 make it larger, smaller, change its brass to silver, make it a lever, I can change the door; put colors on, put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door and in the two seconds you take to open it, you'll notice something has changed.Now, the engineering approach, the AI approach to this, is to build a door database with all the door attributes. And as you go up to the door, we check them off one at time: door, door, color ... We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that. Your brain is making constant predictions all the time about what will happen in your environment. As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop. When I walk, every step, if I missed it by an eighth of an inch, I'll know something has changed. You're constantly making predictions about your environment. I'll talk about vision, briefly. This is a picture of a woman. When we look at people, our eyes saccade over two to three times a second. We're not aware of it, but our eyes are always moving. When we look at a face, we typically go from eye to eye to nose to mouth. When your eye moves from eye to eye, if there was something else there like a nose, you'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go, \"Oh, shit!\"(Laughter)\"There's something wrong about this person.\" That's because you're making a prediction. It's not like you just look over and say, \"What am I seeing? A nose? OK.\" No, you have an expectation of what you're going to see.Every single moment. And finally, let's think about how we test intelligence. We test it by prediction: What is the next word in this ...? This is to this as this is to this. What is the next number in this sentence? Here's three visions of an object. What's the fourth one? That's how we test it. It's all about prediction.So what is the recipe for brain theory? First of all, we have to have the right framework. And the framework is a memory framework, not a computational or behavior framework, it's a memory framework. How do you store and recall these sequences of patterns? It's spatiotemporal patterns.Then, if in that framework, you take a bunch of theoreticians \u2014 biologists generally are not good theoreticians. Not always, but generally, there's not a good history of theory in biology. I've found the best people to work with are physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who tend to think algorithmically. Then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology. You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms. Anyone who tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working and how the wiring works \u2014 it's not a theory.And that's what we do at the Redwood Neuroscience Institute. I'd love to tell you we're making fantastic progress in this thing, and I expect to be back on this stage sometime in the not too distant future, to tell you about it. I'm really excited; this is not going to take 50 years.What will brain theory look like? First of all, it's going to be about memory. Not like computer memory \u2014 not at all like computer memory. It's very different. It's a memory of very high-dimensional patterns, like the things that come from your eyes. It's also memory of sequences: you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence. A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time. And these sequences are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it, and it plays back automatically. It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output. And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable and you must be able to build it. If you don't build it, you don't understand it.One more slide. What is this going to result in? Are we going to really build intelligent machines? Absolutely. And it's going to be different than people think. No doubt that it's going to happen, in my mind. First of all, we're going to build this stuff out of silicon. The same techniques we use to build silicon computer memories, we can use here. But they're very different types of memories. And we'll attach these memories to sensors, and the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data, and learn about their environment.Now, it's very unlikely the first things you'll see are like robots. Not that robots aren't useful; people can build robots. But the robotics part is the hardest part. That's old brain. That's really hard. The new brain is easier than the old brain. So first we'll do things that don't require a lot of robotics. So you're not going to see C-3PO. You're going to see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is, what driving is and have learned that cars with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren't going to turn.(Laughter)We can also do intelligent security systems. Anytime we're basically using our brain but not doing a lot of mechanics \u2014 those are the things that will happen first. But ultimately, the world's the limit. I don't know how this will turn out. I know a lot of people who invented the microprocessor. And if you talk to them, they knew what they were doing was really significant, but they didn't really know what was going to happen. They couldn't anticipate cell phones and the Internet and all this kind of stuff. They just knew like, \"We're going to build calculators and traffic-light controllers. But it's going to be big!\" In the same way, brain science and these memories are going to be a very fundamental technology, and it will lead to unbelievable changes in the next 100 years. And I'm most excited about how we're going to use them in science. So I think that's all my time \u2014 I'm over, and I'm going to end my talk right there.", "id": 125, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:13.585\nI do two things:\n\n00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.727\nI design mobile computers\nand I study brains.\n\n00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.681\nToday's talk is about brains\nand -- (Audience member cheers)\n\n00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:20.522\nYay!

very original laptop\n\n00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:02.484\nto some of the first tablet computers\n\n00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:04.806\nand so on, ending up\nmost recently with the Treo,\n\n00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.362\nand we're continuing to do this.\n\n00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:08.687\nI've done this because\nI believe mobile computing\n\n00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.435\nis the future of personal computing,\n\n00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:12.913\nand I'm trying to make\nthe world a little bit better\n\n00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:14.233\nby working on these things.\n\n00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:16.131\nBut this was, I admit, all an accident.\n\n00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:18.463\nI really didn't want to do\nany of these products.\n\n00:01:18.487 --> 00:01:19.869\nVery early in my career\n\n00:01:19.893 --> 00:01:22.583\nI decided I was not going to be\nin the computer industry.\n\n00:01:22.607 --> 00:01:24.328\nBefore that, I just have to tell you\n\n00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.460\nabout this picture of Graffiti\nI picked off the web the other day.\n\n00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:30.737\nI was looking for a picture for Graffiti\nthat'll text input language.\n\n00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:34.450\nI found a website dedicated to teachers\nwho want to make script-writing things\n\n00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:36.148\nacross the top of their blackboard,\n\n00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:39.005\nand they had added Graffiti to it,\nand I'm sorry about that.\n\n00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.276\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.600\nSo what happened was,\n\n00:01:42.624 --> 00:01:47.523\nwhen I was young and got out\nof engineering school at Cornell in '79,\n\n00:01:47.547 --> 00:01:50.734\nI went to work for Intel\nand was in the computer industry,\n\n00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:54.160\nand three months into that,\nI fell in love with something else.\n\n00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:57.228\nI said, \"I made\nthe wrong career choice here,\"\n\n00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.491\nand I fell in love with brains.\n\n00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.048\nThis is not a real brain.\n\n00:02:01.072 --> 00:02:03.791\nThis is a picture of one, a line drawing.\n\n00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:05.934\nAnd I don't remember\nexactly how it happened,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.473\nbut I have one recollection,\nwhich was pretty strong in my mind.\n\n00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:11.107\nIn September of 1979,\n\n00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.495\nScientific American came out\nwith a single-topic issue about the brain.\n\n00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.457\nIt was one of their best issues ever.\n\n00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:19.428\nThey talked about the neuron,\ndevelopment, disease, vision\n\n00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.048\nand all the things you might want\nto know about brains.\n\n00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:23.574\nIt was really quite impressive.\n\n00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:26.370\nOne might've had the impression\nwe knew a lot about brains.\n\n00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:30.589\nBut the last article in that issue\nwas written by Francis Crick of DNA fame.\n\n00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:33.637\nToday is, I think, the 50th anniversary\nof the discovery of DNA.\n\n00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.736\nAnd he wrote a story basically saying,\nthis is all well and good,\n\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.503\nbut you know, we don't know\ndiddly squat about brains,\n\n00:02:39.527 --> 00:02:41.266\nand no one has a clue how they work,\n\n00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.156\nso don't believe what anyone tells you.\n\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.345\nThis is a quote\nfrom that article, he says:\n\n00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.662\n\"What is conspicuously lacking\" --\nhe's a very proper British gentleman --\n\n00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:52.516\n\"What is conspicuously lacking\nis a broad framework of ideas\n\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.892\nin which to interpret\nthese different approaches.\"\n\n00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:56.884\nI thought the word \"framework\" was great.\n\n00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:58.725\nHe didn't say we didn't have a theory.\n\n00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.474\nHe says we don't even know\nhow to begin to think about it.\n\n00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:02.990\nWe don't even have a framework.\n\n00:03:03.014 --> 00:03:06.064\nWe are in the pre-paradigm days,\nif you want to use Thomas Kuhn.\n\n00:03:06.088 --> 00:03:07.427\nSo I fell in love with this.\n\n00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.026\nI said, look: We have all this knowledge\nabout brains -- how hard can it be?\n\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.488\nIt's something we can work on\nin my lifetime; I could make a difference.\n\n00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:18.131\nSo I tried to get out of the computer\nbusiness, into the brain business.\n\n00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:20.159\nFirst, I went to MIT,\nthe AI lab was there.\n\n00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:22.578\nI said, I want to build\nintelligent machines too,\n\n00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.119\nbut I want to study how brains work first.\n\n00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:27.449\nAnd they said, \"Oh, you\ndon't need to do that.\n\n00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.863\nYou're just going to program\ncomputers, that's all.\n\n00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.850\nI said, you really ought to study brains.\n\n00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:33.306\nThey said, \"No, you're wrong.\"\n\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.576\nI said, \"No, you're wrong,\"\nand I didn't get in.\n\n00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.678\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:38.857\nI was a little disappointed --\npretty young --\n\n00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:40.817\nbut I went back again a few years later,\n\n00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.200\nthis time in California,\nand I went to Berkeley.\n\n00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.654\nAnd I said, I'll go\nin from the biological side.\n\n00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:48.767\nSo I got in the PhD program in biophysics.\n\n00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.201\nI was like, I'm studying brains now.\nWell, I want to study theory.\n\n00:03:52.225 --> 00:03:54.494\nThey said, \"You can't\nstudy theory about brains.\n\n00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:56.513\nYou can't get funded for that.\n\n00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.692\nAnd as a graduate student,\nyou can't do that.\"\n\n00:03:58.716 --> 00:03:59.934\nSo I said, oh my gosh.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:03.113\nI was depressed; I said, but I can\nmake a difference in this field.\n\n00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:05.145\nI went back in the computer industry\n\n00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.274\nand said, I'll have to work\nhere for a while.\n\n00:04:07.298 --> 00:04:09.691\nThat's when I designed\nall those computer products.\n\n00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:11.016\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.934\nI said, I want to do this\nfor four years, make some money,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.934\nI was having a family,\nand I would mature a bit,\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.774\nand maybe the business\nof neuroscience would mature a bit.\n\n00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.799\nWell, it took longer than four years.\nIt's been about 16 years.\n\n00:04:23.823 --> 00:04:26.539\nBut I'm doing it now,\nand I'm going to tell you about it.\n\n00:04:26.563 --> 00:04:28.849\nSo why should we have a good brain theory?\n\n00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:31.975\nWell, there's lots of reasons\npeople do science.\n\n00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.916\nThe most basic one is,\npeople like to know things.\n\n00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.135\nWe're curious, and we go out\nand get knowledge.\n\n00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.025\nWhy do we study ants? It's interesting.\n\n00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:42.515\nMaybe we'll learn something useful,\nbut it's interesting and fascinating.\n\n00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.596\nBut sometimes a science\nhas other attributes\n\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.449\nwhich makes it really interesting.\n\n00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:49.100\nSometimes a science will tell\nsomething about ourselves;\n\n00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.348\nit'll tell us who we are.\n\n00:04:50.372 --> 00:04:53.124\nEvolution did this\nand Copernicus did this,\n\n00:04:53.148 --> 00:04:55.482\nwhere we have a new\nunderstanding of who we are.\n\n00:04:55.506 --> 00:04:58.934\nAnd after all, we are our brains.\nMy brain is talking to your brain.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.988\nOur bodies are hanging along for the ride,\n\n00:05:01.012 --> 00:05:02.837\nbut my brain is talking to your brain.\n\n00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.109\nAnd if we want to understand\nwho we are and how we feel and perceive,\n\n00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.524\nwe need to understand brains.\n\n00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:11.332\nAnother thing is sometimes science leads\nto big societal benefits, technologies,\n\n00:05:11.356 --> 00:05:12.647\nor businesses or whatever.\n\n00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:15.549\nThis is one, too, because\nwhen we understand how brains work,\n\n00:05:15.573 --> 00:05:17.637\nwe'll be able to build\nintelligent machines.\n\n00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:19.359\nThat's a good thing on the whole,\n\n00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:21.241\nwith tremendous benefits to society,\n\n00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:22.934\njust like a fundamental technology.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.808\nSo why don't we have\na good theory of brains?\n\n00:05:25.832 --> 00:05:28.000\nPeople have been working\non it for 100 years.\n\n00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:30.743\nLet's first take a look\nat what normal science looks like.\n\n00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:31.954\nThis is normal science.\n\n00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:36.052\nNormal science is a nice balance\nbetween theory and experimentalists.\n\n00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:38.767\nThe theorist guy says,\n\"I think this is what's going on,\"\n\n00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:40.752\nthe experimentalist says, \"You're wrong.\"\n\n00:05:40.776 --> 00:05:43.780\nIt goes back and forth,\nthis works in physics, this in geology.\n\n00:05:43.804 --> 00:05:46.813\nBut if this is normal science,\nwhat does neuroscience look like?\n\n00:05:46.837 --> 00:05:48.632\nThis is what neuroscience looks like.\n\n00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:50.098\nWe have this mountain of data,\n\n00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:52.192\nwhich is anatomy, physiology and behavior.\n\n00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:55.410\nYou can't imagine how much detail\nwe know about brains.\n\n00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:59.026\nThere were 28,000 people who went\nto the neuroscience conference this year,\n\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.413\nand every one of them\nis doing research in brains.\n\n00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:03.131\nA lot of data, but no theory.\n\n00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:05.155\nThere's a little wimpy box on top there.\n\n00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:08.561\nAnd theory has not played a role\nin any sort of grand way\n\n00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:10.014\nin the neurosciences.\n\n00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:11.278\nAnd it's a real shame.\n\n00:06:11.302 --> 00:06:12.693\nNow, why has this come about?\n\n00:06:12.717 --> 00:06:15.705\nIf you ask neuroscientists\nwhy is this the state of affairs,\n\n00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:16.975\nfirst, they'll admit it.\n\n00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:18.484\nBut if you ask them, they say,\n\n00:06:18.508 --> 00:06:21.240\nthere's various reasons\nwe don't have a good brain theory.\n\n00:06:21.264 --> 00:06:23.233\nSome say we still don't have enough data,\n\n00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.316\nwe need more information,\nthere's all these things we don't know.\n\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.181\nWell, I just told you there's data\ncoming out of your ears.\n\n00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:32.369\nWe have so much information,\nwe don't even know how to organize it.\n\n00:06:32.393 --> 00:06:33.831\nWhat good is more going to do?\n\n00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:37.303\nMaybe we'll be lucky and discover\nsome magic thing, but I don't think so.\n\n00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:40.300\nThis is a symptom of the fact\nthat we just don't have a theory.\n\n00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:42.934\nWe don't need more data,\nwe need a good theory.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.756\nAnother one is sometimes people say,\n\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.934\n\"Brains are so complex,\nit'll take another 50 years.\"\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.312\nI even think Chris said something\nlike this yesterday, something like,\n\n00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:53.963\nit's one of the most complicated\nthings in the universe.\n\n00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.777\nThat's not true -- you're more\ncomplicated than your brain.\n\n00:06:56.801 --> 00:06:57.952\nYou've got a brain.\n\n00:06:57.976 --> 00:07:00.126\nAnd although the brain\nlooks very complicated,\n\n00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.486\nthings look complicated\nuntil you understand them.\n\n00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.845\nThat's always been the case.\n\n00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:07.112\nSo we can say, my neocortex,\nthe part of the brain I'm interested in,\n\n00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:08.288\nhas 30 billion cells.\n\n00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:10.744\nBut, you know what?\nIt's very, very regular.\n\n00:07:10.768 --> 00:07:14.162\nIn fact, it looks like it's the same thing\nrepeated over and over again.\n\n00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:16.722\nIt's not as complex as it looks.\nThat's not the issue.\n\n00:07:16.746 --> 00:07:19.033\nSome people say,\nbrains can't understand brains.\n\n00:07:19.057 --> 00:07:21.045\nVery Zen-like.

A lot of it.\n\n00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:40.820\nBut it got more manageable\nonce they had a theory.\n\n00:08:40.844 --> 00:08:43.651\nThe best minds were stumped --\nreally smart people.\n\n00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:45.679\nWe're not smarter now than they were then;\n\n00:08:45.703 --> 00:08:48.230\nit just turns out it's really\nhard to think of things,\n\n00:08:48.254 --> 00:08:50.930\nbut once you've thought of them,\nit's easy to understand.\n\n00:08:50.954 --> 00:08:53.060\nMy daughters understood\nthese three theories,\n\n00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:55.602\nin their basic framework, in kindergarten.\n\n00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:58.892\nIt's not that hard --\nhere's the apple, here's the orange,\n\n00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:00.934\nthe Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.544\nAnother thing is the answer\nwas there all along,\n\n00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:06.347\nbut we kind of ignored it\nbecause of this obvious thing.\n\n00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:09.221\nIt was an intuitive,\nstrongly held belief that was wrong.\n\n00:09:09.245 --> 00:09:10.935\nIn the case of the solar system,\n\n00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.719\nthe idea that the Earth is spinning,\n\n00:09:12.743 --> 00:09:14.934\nthe surface is going\na thousand miles an hour,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.207\nand it's going through the solar system\nat a million miles an hour --\n\n00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:20.707\nthis is lunacy; we all know\nthe Earth isn't moving.\n\n00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:23.608\nDo you feel like you're moving\na thousand miles an hour?\n\n00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:26.551\nIf you said Earth was spinning\naround in space and was huge --\n\n00:09:26.575 --> 00:09:29.166\nthey would lock you up,\nthat's what they did back then.\n\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.465\nSo it was intuitive and obvious.\nNow, what about evolution?\n\n00:09:32.489 --> 00:09:33.643\nEvolution, same thing.\n\n00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:36.747\nWe taught our kids the Bible says\nGod created all these species,\n\n00:09:36.771 --> 00:09:39.914\ncats are cats; dogs are dogs;\npeople are people; plants are plants;\n\n00:09:39.938 --> 00:09:41.179\nthey don't change.\n\n00:09:41.203 --> 00:09:43.852\nNoah put them on the ark\nin that order, blah, blah.\n\n00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:47.271\nThe fact is, if you believe in evolution,\nwe all have a common ancestor.\n\n00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:50.577\nWe all have a common ancestor\nwith the plant in the lobby!\n\n00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:54.287\nThis is what evolution tells us.\nAnd it's true.

It has fears\nand emotions.

It's your emotional brain.\n\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.410\nIt's all those gut reactions you have.\n\n00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:58.704\nOn top of it, we have this memory system\ncalled the neocortex.\n\n00:12:58.728 --> 00:13:03.022\nAnd the memory system is sitting\nover the sensory part of the brain.\n\n00:13:03.046 --> 00:13:06.101\nSo as the sensory input\ncomes in and feeds from the old brain,\n\n00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.279\nit also goes up into the neocortex.\n\n00:13:08.303 --> 00:13:10.216\nAnd the neocortex is just memorizing.\n\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.801\nIt's sitting there saying, I'm going\nto memorize all the things going on:\n\n00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:16.844\nwhere I've been, people I've seen,\nthings I've heard, and so on.\n\n00:13:16.868 --> 00:13:20.230\nAnd in the future, when it sees\nsomething similar to that again,\n\n00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:22.889\nin a similar environment,\nor the exact same environment,\n\n00:13:22.913 --> 00:13:26.468\nit'll start playing it back:\n\"Oh, I've been here before,\"\n\n00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:28.856\nand when you were here before,\nthis happened next.\n\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.606\nIt allows you to predict the future.\n\n00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.026\nIt literally feeds back\nthe signals into your brain;\n\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.315\nthey'll let you see\nwhat's going to happen next,\n\n00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:38.934\nwill let you hear the word\n\"sentence\" before I said it.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.143\nAnd it's this feeding\nback into the old brain\n\n00:13:42.167 --> 00:13:44.744\nthat will allow you to make\nmore intelligent decisions.\n\n00:13:44.768 --> 00:13:48.257\nThis is the most important slide\nof my talk, so I'll dwell on it a little.\n\n00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:51.856\nAnd all the time you say,\n\"Oh, I can predict things,\"\n\n00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.240\nso if you're a rat and you go\nthrough a maze, and you learn the maze,\n\n00:13:55.264 --> 00:13:57.703\nnext time you're in one,\nyou have the same behavior.\n\n00:13:57.727 --> 00:14:00.718\nBut suddenly, you're smarter;\nyou say, \"I recognize this maze,\n\n00:14:00.742 --> 00:14:04.284\nI know which way to go; I've been here\nbefore; I can envision the future.\"\n\n00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:05.476\nThat's what it's doing.\n\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.340\nThis is true for all mammals --\n\n00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:10.395\nin humans, it got a lot worse.\n\n00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:13.006\nHumans actually developed\nthe front of the neocortex,\n\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.251\ncalled the anterior part of the neocortex.\n\n00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:16.713\nAnd nature did a little trick.\n\n00:14:16.737 --> 00:14:19.424\nIt copied the posterior,\nthe back part, which is sensory,\n\n00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:20.599\nand put it in the front.\n\n00:14:20.623 --> 00:14:23.103\nHumans uniquely have\nthe same mechanism on the front,\n\n00:14:23.127 --> 00:14:24.681\nbut we use it for motor control.\n\n00:14:24.705 --> 00:14:28.286\nSo we're now able to do very sophisticated\nmotor planning, things like that.\n\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.436\nI don't have time to explain,\nbut to understand how a brain works,\n\n00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.997\nyou have to understand how the first part\nof the mammalian neocortex works,\n\n00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:37.314\nhow it is we store patterns\nand make predictions.\n\n00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:39.526\nLet me give you\na few examples of predictions.\n\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.226\nI already said the word \"sentence.\"\n\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.456\nIn music, if you've heard a song before,\n\n00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.389\nwhen you hear it, the next note\npops into your head already --\n\n00:14:47.413 --> 00:14:48.564\nyou anticipate it.\n\n00:14:48.588 --> 00:14:51.942\nWith an album, at the end of a song,\nthe next song pops into your head.\n\n00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:54.271\nIt happens all the time,\nyou make predictions.\n\n00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:57.334\nI have this thing called\nthe \"altered door\" thought experiment.\n\n00:14:57.358 --> 00:15:00.187\nIt says, you have a door at home;\n\n00:15:00.211 --> 00:15:01.966\nwhen you're here, I'm changing it --\n\n00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.186\nI've got a guy back at your house\nright now, moving the door around,\n\n00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.979\nmoving your doorknob over two inches.\n\n00:15:07.003 --> 00:15:10.587\nWhen you go home tonight, you'll put\nyour hand out, reach for the doorknob,\n\n00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:12.125\nnotice it's in the wrong spot\n\n00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:13.836\nand go, \"Whoa, something happened.\"\n\n00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.961\nIt may take a second,\nbut something happened.\n\n00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:17.988\nI can change your doorknob\nin other ways --\n\n00:15:18.012 --> 00:15:21.253\nmake it larger, smaller, change\nits brass to silver, make it a lever,\n\n00:15:21.277 --> 00:15:23.853\nI can change the door;\nput colors on, put windows in.\n\n00:15:23.877 --> 00:15:26.028\nI can change a thousand things\nabout your door\n\n00:15:26.052 --> 00:15:28.060\nand in the two seconds\nyou take to open it,\n\n00:15:28.084 --> 00:15:29.806\nyou'll notice something has changed.\n\n00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.414\nNow, the engineering approach,\nthe AI approach to this,\n\n00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:35.113\nis to build a door database\nwith all the door attributes.\n\n00:15:35.137 --> 00:15:37.956\nAnd as you go up to the door,\nwe check them off one at time:\n\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.326\ndoor, door, color ...\n\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.450\nWe don't do that.\nYour brain doesn't do that.\n\n00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:44.014\nYour brain is making\nconstant predictions all the time\n\n00:15:44.038 --> 00:15:46.072\nabout what will happen\nin your environment.\n\n00:15:46.096 --> 00:15:48.842\nAs I put my hand on this table,\nI expect to feel it stop.\n\n00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:51.885\nWhen I walk, every step,\nif I missed it by an eighth of an inch,\n\n00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.442\nI'll know something has changed.\n\n00:15:53.466 --> 00:15:56.286\nYou're constantly making predictions\nabout your environment.\n\n00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.903\nI'll talk about vision, briefly.\n\n00:15:57.927 --> 00:15:59.310\nThis is a picture of a woman.\n\n00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:02.824\nWhen we look at people, our eyes saccade\nover two to three times a second.\n\n00:16:02.848 --> 00:16:05.377\nWe're not aware of it,\nbut our eyes are always moving.\n\n00:16:05.401 --> 00:16:08.836\nWhen we look at a face, we typically\ngo from eye to eye to nose to mouth.\n\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.729\nWhen your eye moves from eye to eye,\n\n00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:12.911\nif there was something\nelse there like a nose,\n\n00:16:12.935 --> 00:16:16.481\nyou'd see a nose where an eye\nis supposed to be and go, \"Oh, shit!\"\n\n00:16:16.505 --> 00:16:17.901\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:17.925 --> 00:16:20.034\n\"There's something wrong\nabout this person.\"\n\n00:16:20.058 --> 00:16:22.063\nThat's because you're making a prediction.\n\n00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:25.526\nIt's not like you just look over and say,\n\"What am I seeing?

And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our \u2014 not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this. Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans, more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria. And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful, and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday, but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi is just not going to fill you up. About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories. So it may be good for the waistline, but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long. And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans, that is, unless you eat jellyfish. And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor. And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.This animal is in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" for being the world's heaviest bony fish. It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds \u2014 on a diet of jellyfish, primarily. And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here that the Mola mola \u2014 its common name is sunfish \u2014 that its favorite food is the moon jelly. So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way, even if one is eating the other. Now this is typically how you see sunfish, this is where they get their common name. They like to sunbathe, can't blame them. They just lay out on the surface of the sea and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior, they lie out and bask on the surface.Their other name, Mola mola, is \u2014 it sounds Hawaiian, but it's actually Latin for millstone, and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape. It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part. And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place, was this terribly bizarre shape. You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek, and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes \u2014 they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength, and then you look at the sunfish.(Laughter)And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just \u2014 it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna. So I was just intrigued with what \u2014 you know, what is this animal's story? Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense except in the light of evolution. The Mola's no exception. They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared, 65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs, and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction \u2014 oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here. Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know, about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs \u2014 we're going to head to the high seas. And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing, and we turn our puffer into the Mola. You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.They look \u2014 maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps, but in fact, in fact they are the \u2014 they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea, right up there with flat fish. They're \u2014 every single thing about that fish has been changed. And in terms of fishes \u2014 fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern, just 50 million years ago, so \u2014 so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop. They start as little eggs, and they're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet. A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs, can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries \u2014 imagine \u2014 and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has. And from that little egg, they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry, and develop \u2014 this is their little adolescent stage. They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults. That's a little diver up there in the corner.They're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world. From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight. 600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby, and you had to feed this thing. That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics. Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but \u2014 we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild, but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium \u2014 one of the first places to have them in captivity \u2014 they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months. I said, now, that's a true American.(Laughter)(Applause)So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas, because schooling used to be salvation for fishes, but it's suicide for fishes now. But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school, they still get caught in nets as by-catch. If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination, then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators \u2014 how they live their lives, like the Mola. And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch \u2014 up to 26 percent of the drift net. And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries, they make up up to 90 percent. So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives. And how do you do that? How do you do that with an animal \u2014 very few places in the world. This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries \u2014 it doesn't go to land.How do you get insight? How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets? Well, there's some great new technology that has just recently become available, and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals. And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there. That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity, which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations. And it can record this data for up to two years, and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time, float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue, to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers, and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have \u2014 we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks. So the great thing about the Mola is that when we put the tag on them \u2014 if you look up here \u2014 that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag. And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites. They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites. I think Donne wrote a poem about that. But they have 40 genera of parasites, and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem. And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment. They don't seem to mind, so far. So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific. We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan. And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents, using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives. We'd love to tag in Monterey. Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers. Not this time of year \u2014 it's more around October.And we'd love to tag here \u2014 this is an aerial shot of Monterey \u2014 but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way. The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay, rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style, and then tosses them back and forth. And I'm not exaggerating, it is just \u2014 and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful. And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior, it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day. The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds, so we head down south, to San Diego. Not so many California sea lions down there. And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily, and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp. And under those kelps \u2014 this is why the Molas come there because it's spa time for the Molas there. As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come. And they come and give the Molas \u2014 you can see they strike this funny little position that says, \"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage.\"(Laughter)And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head, and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean \u2014 because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites. And it's also a great place to go down south because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there. I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right, will say, \"Okay, scratch me right there.\" You truly can swim up to a Mola \u2014 they're very gentle \u2014 and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it. So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific; we've gone over to another part of the Pacific, and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan. And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries. And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten. We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged. Well, not the one we tagged! And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to \u2014 I think that \u00eds pretty much the whole fish \u2014 is eaten.So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months. And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording. The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars, so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay. And so the waiting is really the hardest part. I'm going to show you our latest dataset. And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED. And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data, we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator? Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other? And we found that they kind of are homebodies. They're not big migrators. This is their track: we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there. And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan. And that's kind of their home range. Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure, that population doesn't get replenished. So that's a very important piece of data.But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish. They're super industrious. And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we \u2014 they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up and up and down, up to 40 times a day. As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive. Down \u2014 and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper. They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade, and this is why you see them on the surface \u2014 it's so cold down there. They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power, and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down. And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer \u2014 which a whole variety of food's in that layer. So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker, they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.We see the same pattern \u2014 now with these tags we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas, a real three-dimensional play. This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life, where they're going to be tagging all over the world and the Mola's going to enter into that. And what's exciting \u2014 you all travel, and you know the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals, and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge. Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge. It's never \u2014 it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun. I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish. And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered, and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh. But people would write into the site with all sorts of, all sorts of stories about these animals and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis. And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared \u2014 a shared love and an interest in the oceans. I was getting reports from Catholic nuns, Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians \u2014 everybody writing in, united by their love of life. And to me that \u2014 I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself: \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\" And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping. If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.", "id": 126, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:15.958\nI'd like to start tonight by something completely different,\n\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nasking you to join me by stepping off the land\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nand jumping into the open ocean for a moment.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:29.958\n90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,\n\n00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\nAnd it's a lively and a lovely place,\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.958\nbut we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nnot only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:51.958\nour adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.958\nbut also, most recently, with climate change,\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nand Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nmore and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:09.958\nwill be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.\n\n00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nAnd this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nNow jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:21.958\nand you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.958\nbut they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi\n\n00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nis just not going to fill you up.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:33.958\nAbout 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.958\nSo it may be good for the waistline,\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nbut it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:43.958\nAnd a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish\n\n00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nisn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nthat is, unless you eat jellyfish.\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.958\nAnd this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack\n\n00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.958\non this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nwhose primary prey are jellyfish.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nThis animal is in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\"\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nfor being the world's heaviest bony fish.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nIt reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:21.958\nAnd I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here\n\n00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nthat the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nthat its favorite food is the moon jelly.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.958\neven if one is eating the other.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nNow this is typically how you see sunfish,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthis is where they get their common name.\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nThey like to sunbathe, can't blame them.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nThey just lay out on the surface of the sea\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nand most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.958\nthey lie out and bask on the surface.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:57.958\nTheir other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian,\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nbut it's actually Latin for millstone,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nand that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nIt's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nAnd that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nwas this terribly bizarre shape.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nYou know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nand you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nthey just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand then you look at the sunfish.\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:34.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nAnd this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just --\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nit really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nSo I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?\n\n00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nWell, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense\n\n00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nexcept in the light of evolution.\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nThe Mola's no exception.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThey appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:09.958\n65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nand they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\noblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nOf course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nabout 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nthat said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nwe're going to head to the high seas.\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nAnd lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand we turn our puffer into the Mola.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nYou know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nThey look -- maybe they look\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nkind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nbut in fact, in fact they are the --\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nthey vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nright up there with flat fish.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nThey're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nAnd in terms of fishes --\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nfishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\njust 50 million years ago, so --\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nso interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nThey start as little eggs,\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nand they're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again\n\n00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.958\nfor having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nA single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\ncan carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nand they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nAnd from that little egg,\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthey pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nand develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nThey school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nThat's a little diver up there in the corner.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nThey're in \"The Guinness World Book of Records\" again\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nfor being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nFrom their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:22.958\ntill they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.\n\n00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:28.958\n600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nand you had to feed this thing.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nThat would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nNow I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nwe don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nbut captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\none of the first places to have them in captivity --\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthey had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nI said, now, that's a true American.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.958\nSo being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nbecause schooling used to be salvation for fishes,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nbut it's suicide for fishes now.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nBut unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nthey still get caught in nets as by-catch.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nIf we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nthen we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nhow they live their lives, like the Mola.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nAnd unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nup to 26 percent of the drift net.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nAnd in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nthey make up up to 90 percent.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nSo we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd how do you do that?\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nHow do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.\n\n00:07:53.958 --> 00:07:57.958\nThis is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nHow do you get insight?\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:04.958\nHow do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nWell, there's some great new technology\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nthat has just recently become available,\n\n00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nand it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.958\nAnd it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.\n\n00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThat little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nwhich is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nAnd it can record this data for up to two years,\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nand keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nfloat to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nto satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nand we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nwe just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nSo the great thing about the Mola\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nis that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nthat's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nAnd it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nMolas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThey're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nI think Donne wrote a poem about that.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nBut they have 40 genera of parasites,\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nand so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAnd they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThey don't seem to mind, so far.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nSo what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nWe're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nusing temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nWe'd love to tag in Monterey.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nMonterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nNot this time of year -- it's more around October.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nAnd we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey --\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nbut unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nbecause another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nThe California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nrips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.958\nand then tosses them back and forth.\n\n00:10:13.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nAnd I'm not exaggerating, it is just --\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nand sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nAnd you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nit's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThe poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nso we head down south, to San Diego.\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nNot so many California sea lions down there.\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nAnd the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nand they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.\n\n00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:47.958\nAnd under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nbecause it's spa time for the Molas there.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nAs soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nAnd they come and give the Molas --\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nyou can see they strike this funny little position that says,\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\n\"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage.\"\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.958\nAnd they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nand the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nbecause the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nAnd it's also a great place to go down south\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nbecause the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nI mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nwill say, \"Okay, scratch me right there.\"\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nYou truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nand if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nSo we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nwe've gone over to another part of the Pacific,\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nand we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:51.958\nAnd over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nAnd they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nWe were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nWell, not the one we tagged!\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nAnd everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:12.958\nto the fin muscle to -- I think that \u00eds pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSo the hardest part of tagging, now, is\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nafter you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nAnd you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nI hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.958\nduring the course that the tag is recording.\n\n00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nThe tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nso you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nAnd so the waiting is really the hardest part.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nI'm going to show you our latest dataset.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nAnd it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nAnd in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nwe're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.958\nDo they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nAnd we found that they kind of are homebodies.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.958\nThey're not big migrators. This is their track:\n\n00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nwe deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nkind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nAnd after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nAnd that's kind of their home range.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nNow that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nthat population doesn't get replenished.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo that's a very important piece of data.\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nBut also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nThey're super industrious.\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nAnd this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthey're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nand up and down, up to 40 times a day.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAs the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:03.958\nDown -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.\n\n00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nThey plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nand this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nThey've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nand then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nAnd they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nwhich a whole variety of food's in that layer.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nSo rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nthey're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.958\nbetween the surface and the bottom and through temperature.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nWe see the same pattern -- now with these tags\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nwe're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.958\na real three-dimensional play.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nThis is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nwhere they're going to be tagging all over the world\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nand the Mola's going to enter into that.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nAnd what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthe best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nand to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nWell now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nand explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nIt's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nWhich brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nI set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:38.958\nAnd so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,\n\n00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:42.958\nand I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.\n\n00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nBut people would write into the site with all sorts of,\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nall sorts of stories about these animals\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.958\nand wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nAnd what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\na shared love and an interest in the oceans.\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nI was getting reports from Catholic nuns,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nJewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nunited by their love of life.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nAnd to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:\n\n00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:26.958\n\"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\"\n\n00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nAnd sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nIf it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future."}, {"title": "How PhotoSynth can connect the world's images", "duration": "450", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth", "transcript": "What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data.We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want. And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range. It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data. This is \"Bleak House\" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture. Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book. I wouldn't recommend it.This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian. Every large image is the beginning of a section. And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium. We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution \u2014 much higher than in an ordinary ad \u2014 and we've embedded extra content. If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. Or other models, or even technical specifications. And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that \u2014 shouldn't be necessary.Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. But those are all the roads in the U.S. superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. So let's pull up, now, something else. This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out.This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies. One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. You can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience.But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots \u2014 all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies \u2014 all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially. I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. Some are much more spatial. I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets \u2014 this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer \u2014 to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology, It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. We can just navigate in this very simple way.(Applause)(Applause ends)You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here.(Laughter)I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. If I can find some of the sort of weird ones \u2014 So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on. Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs \u2014 here we go. This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment.What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody \u2014 from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like \u2014 and link all of that together. Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way. And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory.Thank you so much.(Applause)(Applause ends)Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together?BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering, creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images. It's doing that based on the content inside the images. And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. What if that picture links to all of your pictures? The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect.CA: Truly incredible.

--> 00:02:47.350\ndone by Noah Snavely, a graduate student\nat the University of Washington,\n\n00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.203\nco-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.\n\n00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:51.205\nand Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.\n\n00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.962\nA very nice collaboration.\n\n00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.478\nAnd so this is live on the Web.\nIt's powered by Seadragon.\n\n00:02:56.502 --> 00:02:59.006\nYou can see that\nwhen we do these sorts of views,\n\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.753\nwhere we can dive through images\n\n00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:03.111\nand have this kind\nof multi-resolution experience.\n\n00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:06.934\nBut the spatial arrangement of the images\nhere is actually meaningful.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.149\nThe computer vision algorithms\nhave registered these images together\n\n00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.934\nso that they correspond to the real\nspace in which these shots --\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.258\nall taken near Grassi Lakes\nin the Canadian Rockies --\n\n00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:18.945\nall these shots were taken.\n\n00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.436\nSo you see elements here\n\n00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.473\nof stabilized slide-show\nor panoramic imaging,\n\n00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.934\nand these things have\nall been related spatially.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nI'm not sure if I have time\nto show you any other environments.\n\n00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:33.413\nSome are much more spatial.\n\n00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:37.382\nI would like to jump straight\nto one of Noah's original data-sets --\n\n00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:40.958\nthis is from an early prototype\nthat we first got working this summer --\n\n00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.876\nto show you what I think\n\n00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.738\nis really the punch line\nbehind the Photosynth technology,\n\n00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:48.323\nIt's not necessarily so apparent\n\n00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:51.242\nfrom looking at the environments\nwe've put up on the website.\n\n00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:53.443\nWe had to worry\nabout the lawyers and so on.\n\n00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.768\nThis is a reconstruction\nof Notre Dame Cathedral\n\n00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:59.249\nthat was done entirely computationally\nfrom images scraped from Flickr.\n\n00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:01.292\nYou just type Notre Dame into Flickr,\n\n00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:05.170\nand you get some pictures of guys\nin T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.\n\n00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:08.340\nAnd each of these orange cones\nrepresents an image\n\n00:04:08.364 --> 00:04:11.598\nthat was discovered\nto belong to this model.\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:14.934\nAnd so these are all Flickr images,\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.934\nand they've all been related\nspatially in this way.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.292\nWe can just navigate\nin this very simple way.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.878\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:30.529\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.507\nYou know, I never thought\nthat I'd end up working at Microsoft.\n\n00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:36.531\nIt's very gratifying to have\nthis kind of reception here.\n\n00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:39.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:45.006\nI guess you can see this is\nlots of different types of cameras:\n\n00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.191\nit's everything from cell-phone cameras\nto professional SLRs,\n\n00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:51.406\nquite a large number of them,\nstitched together in this environment.\n\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.062\nIf I can find some\nof the sort of weird ones --\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.280\nSo many of them are occluded\nby faces, and so on.\n\n00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:03.830\nSomewhere in here there is actually\na series of photographs -- here we go.\n\n00:05:03.854 --> 00:05:07.155\nThis is actually a poster of Notre Dame\nthat registered correctly.\n\n00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:10.395\nWe can dive in from the poster\n\n00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.229\nto a physical view of this environment.\n\n00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:20.245\nWhat the point here really is\n\n00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:22.860\nis that we can do things\nwith the social environment.\n\n00:05:22.884 --> 00:05:25.886\nThis is now taking data from everybody --\n\n00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.781\nfrom the entire collective memory,\nvisually, of what the Earth looks like --\n\n00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:31.554\nand link all of that together.\n\n00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:34.417\nThose photos become linked,\nand they make something emergent\n\n00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:36.394\nthat's greater than the sum of the parts.\n\n00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:38.774\nYou have a model that emerges\nof the entire Earth.\n\n00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:42.875\nThink of this as the long tail\nto Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.\n\n00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.099\nAnd this is something that grows\nin complexity as people use it,\n\n00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:49.934\nand whose benefits become greater\nto the users as they use it.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:53.650\nTheir own photos are getting tagged\nwith meta-data that somebody else entered.\n\n00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:57.034\nIf somebody bothered\nto tag all of these saints\n\n00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:00.011\nand say who they all are,\nthen my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral\n\n00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:02.133\nsuddenly gets enriched\nwith all of that data,\n\n00:06:02.157 --> 00:06:04.934\nand I can use it as an entry point\nto dive into that space,\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.639\ninto that meta-verse,\nusing everybody else's photos,\n\n00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:10.964\nand do a kind of a cross-modal\n\n00:06:10.988 --> 00:06:14.739\nand cross-user social experience that way.\n\n00:06:14.763 --> 00:06:18.934\nAnd of course, a by-product of all of that\nis immensely rich virtual models\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.926\nof every interesting part of the Earth,\n\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.437\ncollected not just from overhead flights\nand from satellite images\n\n00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.513\nand so on, but from the collective memory.\n\n00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:28.631\nThank you so much.\n\n00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:35.518\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:38.925 --> 00:06:39.926\n(Applause ends)\n\n00:06:39.950 -->

I don't think we're going to make it. Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk. Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner with the family. The conversation turned to global warming, and everybody agreed, there's a real problem. We've got a climate crisis. So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do. The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary. She said, \"I agree with everything that's been said. I'm scared and I'm angry.\" And then she turned to me and said, \"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it.\" Wow. All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me. (Laughter) I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is, \"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\" (Laughter) And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences, we must act, and we must act decisively. I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more, to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes. We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India, to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento. And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you about what we've learned in those journeys. Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew. You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers, and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like avian flu or personalized medicine, we just get together the smartest people we know. For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really, of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders. Fifty or so of them. And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that and four lessons I've learned in the last year.The first lesson is that companies are really powerful, and that matters a lot. This is a story about how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means. Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority. They committed that they're going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent, and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years. The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration. So, look what they did. They painted the roofs of all their stores white. They put smart skylights through their stores so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands. And, third, they put the refrigerated goods behind closed doors with LED lighting. I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store? These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive. They're the largest private employer in America. They're the largest private user of electricity. They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road. And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains, 60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country, it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China. And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable, it has a powerful impact on other great institutions. So, let me tell you this: when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions, that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough. We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter, and they matter enormously. I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK? Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers. That's a third of the U.S. population. 65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year. And Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy. Consumers don't really like these light bulbs. The light's kind of funny, they won't dim, takes a while for them to start up. But the pay-off is really enormous. 100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills, and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out. It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing. It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall. It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles in Fiji and ship it here. (Laughter)It's hard to change consumer behavior because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know? Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here? I don't know, and I should. Those of us who care about all this would act better if we knew what the real costs were. But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free, as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change? I'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes we can reasonably expect from individuals are going to be clearly not enough.The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters. In fact, policy is paramount. I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green tech network I described. At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about what the action items would be, how we'd follow up. And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up. You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase. Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California. It's necessary and, just as important, it's good for the California economy.So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32. You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill, so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32. (Applause) Please. Thank you. I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why? Because California was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020. And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs, four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions by 174 million tons a year. California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions. It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start, but I've got to tell you \u2014 where I started \u2014 I'm really afraid. In fact, I'm certain California's not enough.Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from. You know Tom Friedman says, \"If you don't go, you don't know\"? Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg. He's the father of the ethanol revolution. He told us that Brazil's government mandated that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol. And they mandated that their new vehicles would be flex-fuel compatible, right? They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline. And so, here's what's happened in Brazil. They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps \u2014 this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California \u2014 and in three years their new car fleet has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel. Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel. And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it. So, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced 40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol. That's 59 billion dollars since 1975 that they didn't ship to the Middle East. It's created a million jobs inside that country, and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial. That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country. But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission. So, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough. In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have are not going to be enough.The fourth and final lesson we've learned is about the potential of radical innovation. So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem and a breakthrough technology. Every year a million and a half people die of a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day. All for want of two dollars' worth of medications that we can buy at the corner drugstore. Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa. So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin, and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper. And in doing so, they'll save a million lives \u2014 at least a million lives a year. A million lives. Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology. This leverages millions of years of evolution by redesigning bugs to make really useful products. Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe, you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.Now, you may ask, John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis? Well, I'll tell you \u2014 a lot. We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology that they're using can be used to make better biofuels. Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal. That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way. So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels. I guess that's better living through bugs. Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it. And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say the second best way is to finance it. And that's why we're investing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies for innovation in green technologies. And we're encouraging others to do it as well. We're talking a lot about this.In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars. But I'm really afraid we need much, much more. For reference, fact one: Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day. Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D? Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy is barely a billion dollars in total. Less than one day of Exxon's revenues. Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs for the next thousand years. And the federal budget calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy. It is almost criminal that we are not investing more in energy research in this country. And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises. Who would have thought that a mass retailer could make money by going green? Who would have thought that a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation? Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle would come from a developing country in South America? And who would have thought that scientists trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels? And who would have thought that all that is not enough? Not enough to stabilize the climate. Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean. The scientists tell us \u2014 and they're only guessing \u2014 that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half, and do it as fast as possible. Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S., but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere, and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons; the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050. That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world. And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business. When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following, \"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.\" Then he asked, \"Why should China sacrifice our growth so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?\" Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't. We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome. Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide. It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies \u2014 going green \u2014 is bigger than the Internet. It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century. Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be the most important transformation for life on the planet since, as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere. Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's companies and individuals and policies and innovation is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know. Everyone here cares about changing the world and has made a difference in that one way or another.So, our call to action \u2014 my call to you \u2014 is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig. What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral. Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating, lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions. There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.And the most important thing you can do, I think, is to use your personal power and your Rolodex to lead your business, your institution, in going green. Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green for its customers and its suppliers and for itself. Really think outside the box. Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen? It could be bigger than Wal-Mart. I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis. And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy, all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem. Because if we do, I can look forward to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.

I don't think we're going to make it.\n\n00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.958\nProbably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.\n\n00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nShortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.958\nwith the family. The conversation turned to global warming,\n\n00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nand everybody agreed, there's a real problem.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.958\nWe've got a climate crisis.\n\n00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.958\nSo, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.\n\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.958\nThe conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:49.958\nShe said, \"I agree with everything that's been said.\n\n00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:56.958\nI'm scared and I'm angry.\" And then she turned to me and said,\n\n00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:03.958\n\"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it.\" Wow.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:07.958\nAll the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nI didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.958\n\"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\"\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:23.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nAnd we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:37.958\nthis problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,\n\n00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:39.958\nwe must act, and we must act decisively.\n\n00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nI've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\nAnd so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.958\nto try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nWe went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nto Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAnd so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nabout what we've learned in those journeys.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nBecause the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nYou know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nand so when we see a big problem or an opportunity\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.958\nlike avian flu or personalized medicine,\n\n00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nwe just get together the smartest people we know.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nFor this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nof superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:31.958\nand business leaders. Fifty or so of them.\n\n00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nAnd so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nand four lessons I've learned in the last year.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nThe first lesson is that companies are really powerful,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.958\nand that matters a lot. This is a story about\n\n00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.958\nhow Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nTwo years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nthe next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.\n\n00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nThey committed that they're going to take their existing stores\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nand reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:09.958\nand their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThe three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nand air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nSo, look what they did.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nThey painted the roofs of all their stores white.\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nThey put smart skylights through their stores\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nso they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.\n\n00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nAnd, third, they put the refrigerated goods\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nbehind closed doors with LED lighting.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nI mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThese are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nWhy does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nThey're the largest private employer in America.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nThey're the largest private user of electricity.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nThey have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nAnd they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.958\n60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nit would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nAnd maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWhen Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nit has a powerful impact on other great institutions.\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nSo, let me tell you this:\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.958\nwhen Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nthat's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:31.958\nWe need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.\n\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nThe second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nand they matter enormously.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nI've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nWal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nThat's a third of the U.S. population.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.958\n65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nAnd Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nanother 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nConsumers don't really like these light bulbs.\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nThe light's kind of funny, they won't dim,\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\ntakes a while for them to start up.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nBut the pay-off is really enormous.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\n100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nthat we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nand 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:25.958\nIt does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:31.958\nIt is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic\n\n00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nto haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.\n\n00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nIt's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nin Fiji and ship it here.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nIt's hard to change consumer behavior\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:50.958\nbecause consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nDo you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nI don't know, and I should.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nThose of us who care about all this would act better\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.958\nif we knew what the real costs were.\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nBut as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nas long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nI'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nwe can reasonably expect from individuals\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.958\nare going to be clearly not enough.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nThe third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:29.958\nIn fact, policy is paramount.\n\n00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nI've got a behind-the-scenes story for you\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:33.958\nabout that green tech network I described.\n\n00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nAt the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nwhat the action items would be, how we'd follow up.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nAnd Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nYou know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nWell, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nis to make it clear in Sacramento, California\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:58.958\nthat we need a market-based system of mandates\n\n00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthat's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nIt's necessary and, just as important,\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nit's good for the California economy.\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nSo, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nwith the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nYou know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nso it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nPlease. Thank you.\n\n00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nI think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nBecause California was the first state in this country\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nto mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nAnd the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nfour billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.958\nby 174 million tons a year.\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nCalifornia emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nIt's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nbut I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIn fact, I'm certain California's not enough.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nHere's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nYou know Tom Friedman says, \"If you don't go, you don't know\"?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nWell, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nHe's the father of the ethanol revolution.\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nHe told us that Brazil's government mandated\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:33.958\nthat every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.\n\n00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nAnd they mandated that their new vehicles\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.958\nwould be flex-fuel compatible, right?\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nThey'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nAnd so, here's what's happened in Brazil.\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:46.958\nThey now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nthis versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nand in three years their new car fleet\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nhas gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nCompare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.958\nAnd you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\n40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.958\nThat's 59 billion dollars since 1975\n\n00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nthat they didn't ship to the Middle East.\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nIt's created a million jobs inside that country,\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.958\nand it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThat's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nBut Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nSo, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.\n\n00:09:40.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nIn fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nare not going to be enough.\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nThe fourth and final lesson we've learned\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nis about the potential of radical innovation.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nSo, I want to tell you about a tragic problem\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nand a breakthrough technology.\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nEvery year a million and a half people die of\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\na completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nAll for want of two dollars' worth of medications\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nthat we can buy at the corner drugstore.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nWell, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nSo, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nfrom the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nto make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nand they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nAnd in doing so, they'll save a million lives --\n\n00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nat least a million lives a year. A million lives.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nTheir breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nThis leverages millions of years of evolution\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nby redesigning bugs to make really useful products.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nNow, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nyou change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:52.958\nNow, you may ask,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.958\nJohn, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?\n\n00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nWell, I'll tell you -- a lot.\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nWe've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:05.958\nthat they're using can be used to make better biofuels.\n\n00:11:05.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nDon't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nThat means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nand optimize them along the way.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nSo, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nthat are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nI guess that's better living through bugs.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAlan Kay is famous for saying\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthe best way to predict the future is to invent it.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.958\nAnd, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nthe second best way is to finance it.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nAnd that's why we're investing 200 million dollars\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:48.958\nin a wide range of really disruptive new technologies\n\n00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nfor innovation in green technologies.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd we're encouraging others to do it as well.\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nWe're talking a lot about this.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:59.958\nIn 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nof the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:09.958\nBut I'm really afraid we need much, much more.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nFor reference, fact one:\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nExxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nDo you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&amp;D?\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nSecond fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nis barely a billion dollars in total.\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nLess than one day of Exxon's revenues.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nThird fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nin hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nfor the next thousand years. And the federal budget\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:45.958\ncalls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&amp;D in geothermal energy.\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nIt is almost criminal that we are not investing more\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.958\nin energy research in this country.\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nAnd I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nSo, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:01.958\nWho would have thought that a mass retailer\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:03.958\ncould make money by going green? Who would have thought that\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:07.958\na database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nWho would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nwould come from a developing country in South America?\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nAnd who would have thought that scientists\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:20.958\ntrying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd who would have thought that all that is not enough?\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nNot enough to stabilize the climate.\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nNot enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nThe scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nthat we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nand do it as fast as possible.\n\n00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nNow, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nbut I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nand so somehow we're going to have to find the political will\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nto do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nTo size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.958\nthe U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nwe'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.\n\n00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nThat's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.\n\n00:14:11.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nAnd if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nWhen I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:20.958\nabout their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:25.958\n\"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.\"\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nThen he asked, \"Why should China sacrifice our growth\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nso that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?\"\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:36.958\nDoes anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.\n\n00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nWe've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nmake the right outcome, the profitable outcome,\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nand therefore the likely outcome.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nEnergy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nIt is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWell, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nis bigger than the Internet.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nIt could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.\n\n00:15:04.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nMoreover, if we succeed, it's going to be\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nthe most important transformation for life on the planet since,\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nas Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nNow, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:23.958\ncompanies and individuals and policies and innovation\n\n00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nis not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.\n\n00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nEveryone here cares about changing the world\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nand has made a difference in that one way or another.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:41.958\nSo, our call to action -- my call to you --\n\n00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:47.958\nis for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nWhat can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nGo to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nand buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,\n\n00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:08.958\nlobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThere's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nAnd the most important thing you can do, I think,\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nis to use your personal power and your Rolodex\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nto lead your business, your institution, in going green.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nDo it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:28.958\nfor its customers and its suppliers and for itself.\n\n00:16:28.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nReally think outside the box.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:35.958\nCan you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google\n\n00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:40.958\nor Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?\n\n00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nIt could be bigger than Wal-Mart.\n\n00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:51.958\nI can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.\n\n00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:55.958\nAnd I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,\n\n00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:59.958\nall of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.\n\n00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nBecause if we do, I can look forward\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nto the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:41.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Want to help Africa? Do business here", "duration": "1213", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/ngozi_okonjo_iweala_on_doing_business_in_africa", "transcript": "Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared, but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this. And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at. There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me. (Laughter)What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories and talk about a different Africa. Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS, the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict, and the Africa of disasters.While it is true that those things are going on, there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much. And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why. This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to. This is the Africa of opportunity. This is the Africa where people want to take charge of their own futures and their own destinies. And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.And I want to start by telling you a story about that change in Africa. On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria, was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London. He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars that went into some dormant accounts that belonged to him and his family. This arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the London Metropolitan Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria \u2014 led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu. Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London. Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from London back to Nigeria where, according to our constitution, those in office as governors, president \u2014 as in many countries \u2014 have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened: people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.Today, Alams \u2014 as we call him for short \u2014 is in jail. This is a story about the fact that people in Africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders. This is a story about the fact that people want their resources managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places where they'll benefit just a few of the elite. And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa \u2014 corruption all the time \u2014 I want you to know that the people and the governments are trying hard to fight this in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no. There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there. And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight. So when you hear about corruption, don't just feel that nothing is being done about this \u2014 that you can't operate in any African country because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case. There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing and is being won. In others, like mine, where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria, the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.But the truth of the matter is that this is going on. The results are showing: independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption, and governance is improving. A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.And let me say just one more thing before I leave this area of governance. That is that people talk about corruption, corruption. All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa. That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London \u2014 if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries \u2014 if they're able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption? In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted? So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe \u2014 where the money's going and what can be done to stop it. I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank, on asset recovery, trying to do what we can to get the monies that have been taken abroad \u2014 developing countries' moneys \u2014 to get that sent back. Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back, it may be far more for some of these countries than all the aid that is being put together. (Applause)The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform. Africans, after \u2014 they're tired, we're tired of being the subject of everybody's charity and care. We are grateful, but we know that we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform. And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization that no one can do it but us. We have to do it. We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start. We have to reform our economies, change our leadership, become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.And this is what we started to do in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria. In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa. I want to tell you that. (Laughter) One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people \u2014 chaotic people \u2014 but very interesting people. You'll never be bored. (Laughter)What we started to do was to realize that we had to take charge and reform ourselves. And with the support of a leader who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program, which we developed ourselves. Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president. No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing \u2014 it had no business being in. The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent. So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises. (Applause) We \u2014 as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets. Can you believe that prior to this reform \u2014 which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister \u2014 we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history? (Laughter)Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury. You couldn't get it. You had to bribe. You had to do everything to get your phone. When President Obasanjo supported and launched the liberalization of the telecommunications sector, we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting. Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world, after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people. (Laughter)The smartest one, first to come in, was the MTN company of South Africa. And in the three years that I was Finance Minister, they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year. 360 million in a market \u2014 in a country that is a poor country, with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita. So the market is there. When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know. Nigerians themselves began to develop some wireless telecommunications companies, and three or four others have come in. But there's a huge market out there, and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know. So privatization is one of the things we've done.The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better. Because nobody's going to help you and support you if you're not managing your own finances well. And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price. Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in, because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil. We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget at a price slightly lower than the oil price and save whatever was above that price. We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial. But what it immediately did was that the volatility that had been present in terms of our economic development \u2014 where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast. When they crashed, we crashed. And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy. That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas \u2014 and this went to our reserves \u2014 when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves. By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances. And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people have a predictability of prices in the economy. We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent. And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now. So all the changes and reforms we were able to make have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil and diversify \u2014 and there are so many opportunities in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa \u2014 what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil. Agriculture grew at better than eight percent. As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction, and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out, the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said. We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized that without the proper legislation to make that possible, that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code that is comparable with some of the best in the world. We have opportunities in housing and real estate. There was nothing in a country of 140 million people \u2014 no shopping malls as you know them here. This was an investment opportunity for someone that excited the imagination of people. And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.So, huge things in construction, real estate, mortgage markets. Financial services: we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business. We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring that they increase their capital \u2014 share capital. And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars. The banks \u2014 these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside. Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million. Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million. And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.We are doing the same with the insurance sector. So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity. In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity. And that's what many people know East Africa for: the wildlife, the elephants, and so on. But managing the tourism market in a way that can really benefit the people is very important.So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000, more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect, or will be, but the trend is very clear. I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years, the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum. This is better than the performance of many OECD countries. So it's clear that things are changing.Conflicts are down on the continent; from about 12 conflicts a decade ago, we are down to three or four conflicts \u2014 one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur. And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where if something is going on in one part of the continent, it looks like the entire continent is affected. But you should know that this continent is not \u2014 is a continent of many countries, not one country. And if we are down to three or four conflicts, it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest in stable, growing, exciting economies where there's plenty of opportunity. And I want to just make one point about this investment.The best way to help Africans today is to help them to stand on their own feet. And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs. There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine. But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school, that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves. If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet, isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go? And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in on the continent are the women. (Applause)I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time. Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this. It says, \"Africa: Open for Business.\" And this is a video that has actually won an award as the best documentary of the year. Understand that the woman who made it is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June. But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi, making children's clothes \u2014 which she started as a hobby and grew into a business. Mixing African materials, such as we have, with materials from elsewhere. So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys, with African material mixed in. Very creative designs, has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart. (Laughter) For 10,000 pieces. So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard. I could go on giving examples: Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her. However, many of these are starved for capital to expand, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market. Nobody thinks there's opportunity. But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever.So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing. Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world, who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed, and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income.So I invite you to explore the opportunities. When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully, because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be for you to get involved in something that will do good for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.Thank you very much.

Everybody who came up here\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.958\nsaid they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,\n\n00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.958\nbut this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.\n\n00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.958\nAnd I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.\n\n00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nThere are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:43.958\nWhat I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories\n\n00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.958\nand talk about a different Africa.\n\n00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nAlready this morning there were some allusions to the Africa\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nthat you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:01:01.958\nthe Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,\n\n00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.958\nand the Africa of disasters.\n\n00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nWhile it is true that those things are going on,\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nthere's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.\n\n00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.958\nAnd sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:20.958\nThis is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.\n\n00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nThis is the Africa of opportunity.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.958\nThis is the Africa where people want to take charge of\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:27.958\ntheir own futures and their own destinies.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.958\nAnd this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships\n\n00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nto do this. That's what I want to talk about today.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.958\nAnd I want to start by telling you\n\n00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.958\na story about that change in Africa.\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:44.958\nOn 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:48.958\na governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,\n\n00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:55.958\nwas arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.\n\n00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:00.958\nHe was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars\n\n00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nthat went into some dormant accounts\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nthat belonged to him and his family.\n\n00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nThis arrest occurred because there was cooperation\n\n00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nbetween the London Metropolitan Police\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nand the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nled by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nAlamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:29.958\nDue to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nand ran from London back to Nigeria where,\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.958\naccording to our constitution, those in office\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nas governors, president -- as in many countries --\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:43.958\nhave immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:\n\n00:02:43.958 --> 00:02:47.958\npeople were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nfor his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.\n\n00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nToday, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:02.958\nThis is a story about the fact that people in Africa\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:07.958\nare no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.958\nThis is a story about the fact that people want their resources\n\n00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nmanaged properly for their good, and not taken out to places\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nwhere they'll benefit just a few of the elite.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\ncorruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nand the governments are trying hard to fight this\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.958\nin some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nDoes it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nThere's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:47.958\nAnd that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.\n\n00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nSo when you hear about corruption,\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.958\ndon't just feel that nothing is being done about this --\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat you can't operate in any African country\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nbecause of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:04.958\nThere's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing\n\n00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nand is being won. In others, like mine,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nwhere there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.958\nthe fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nBut the truth of the matter is that this is going on.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nThe results are showing:\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nindependent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations\n\n00:04:26.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nshow that in many instances the trend is downwards\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nin terms of corruption, and governance is improving.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nA study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:41.958\na clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.\n\n00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd let me say just one more thing\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nbefore I leave this area of governance.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nThat is that people talk about corruption, corruption.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nAll the time when they talk about it\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nyou immediately think about Africa.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:56.958\nThat's the image: African countries. But let me say this:\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nif Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nif the other people who had taken money, estimated at\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\n20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nsitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nwhat is that? Is that not corruption?\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.958\nIn this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nSo when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nabout what is happening on the other side of the globe --\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nwhere the money's going and what can be done to stop it.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nI'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.958\non asset recovery, trying to do what we can\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nto get the monies that have been taken abroad --\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:46.958\ndeveloping countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nBecause if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nit may be far more for some of these countries\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nthan all the aid that is being put together.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:06:02.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nThe second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.958\nAfricans, after -- they're tired, we're tired\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nof being the subject of everybody's charity and care.\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nWe are grateful, but we know that\n\n00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nwe can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nAnd what is happening in many African countries now is a realization\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:32.958\nthat no one can do it but us. We have to do it.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:36.958\nWe can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nWe have to reform our economies, change our leadership,\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nbecome more democratic, be more open to change and to information.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:47.958\nAnd this is what we started to do\n\n00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.958\nin one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.\n\n00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nIn fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nI want to tell you that.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nOne in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,\n\n00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --\n\n00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.958\nbut very interesting people. You'll never be bored.\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nWhat we started to do was to realize\n\n00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nthat we had to take charge and reform ourselves.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd with the support of a leader\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nwho was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nwe put forward a comprehensive reform program,\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.958\nwhich we developed ourselves.\n\n00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nNot the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.958\nwhere I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nNo one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.\n\n00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nWe put together a program that would, one: get the state\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nout of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nThe state should not be in the business\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nof producing goods and services\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nbecause it's inefficient and incompetent.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.958\nSo we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.\n\n00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:55.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nWe -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nCan you believe that prior to this reform --\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nwhich started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.958\nto go and take up the post of Finance Minister --\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nwe had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop\n\n00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.958\n4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nHaving a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nYou couldn't get it. You had to bribe.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nYou had to do everything to get your phone.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nWhen President Obasanjo supported and launched\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nthe liberalization of the telecommunications sector,\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nwe went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nNigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:55.958\nafter China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nin telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThe smartest one, first to come in,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nwas the MTN company of South Africa.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nAnd in the three years that I was Finance Minister,\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nthey made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:25.958\n360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwith an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.\n\n00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nSo the market is there.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:35.958\nWhen they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nNigerians themselves began to develop\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nsome wireless telecommunications companies,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nand three or four others have come in.\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nBut there's a huge market out there,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nand people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nSo privatization is one of the things we've done.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:10:00.958\nThe other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nBecause nobody's going to help you and support you\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:07.958\nif you're not managing your own finances well.\n\n00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nAnd Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nof being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nSo what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nthat de-linked our budget from the oil price.\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nBefore we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nbecause oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:35.958\nin the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.\n\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nWe de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nat a price slightly lower than the oil price\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nand save whatever was above that price.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nWe didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nBut what it immediately did was that the volatility\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nthat had been present in terms of our economic development --\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:00.958\nwhere, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.\n\n00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:02.958\nWhen they crashed, we crashed.\n\n00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nAnd we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nThat smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:17.958\n27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nwhen I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nBy the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nas we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\ndue to proper management of our finances.\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nAnd that shores up our economy, makes it stable.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nOur exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nis now fairly stable and being managed so that business people\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nhave a predictability of prices in the economy.\n\n00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nto about 6.5 percent now.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nSo all the changes and reforms we were able to make\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nhave shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:17.958\nAnd what is more important, because we want to get away from oil\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nand diversify -- and there are so many opportunities\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nin this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nwhat was remarkable is that much of this growth came\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nnot from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.958\nAgriculture grew at better than eight percent.\n\n00:12:33.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nAs telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nand I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nonce you get the macro-economy straightened out,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nthe opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nWe have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nthat no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthat without the proper legislation to make that possible,\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nthat wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nthat is comparable with some of the best in the world.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nWe have opportunities in housing and real estate.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nThere was nothing in a country of 140 million people --\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nno shopping malls as you know them here.\n\n00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThis was an investment opportunity for someone\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nthat excited the imagination of people.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nAnd now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nare doing four times the turnover that they had projected.\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:37.958\nSo, huge things in construction, real estate,\n\n00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.958\nmortgage markets. Financial services:\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:44.958\nwe had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.\n\n00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nWe consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nthat they increase their capital -- share capital.\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nAnd it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nThe banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nof the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nBarclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:14.958\nStandard Chartered has brought in 140 million.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nAnd I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe are doing the same with the insurance sector.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nSo in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nIn tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nAnd that's what many people know East Africa for:\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthe wildlife, the elephants, and so on.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nBut managing the tourism market in a way\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nthat can really benefit the people is very important.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nSo what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you\n\n00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nthat there's a new wave on the continent.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nA new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nmore than two-thirds of African countries have had\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nmulti-party democratic elections.\n\n00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nNot all of them have been perfect, or will be,\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nbut the trend is very clear.\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nI'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nthe average rate of growth on the continent has moved\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:13.958\nfrom about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.\n\n00:15:13.958 --> 00:15:17.958\nThis is better than the performance of many OECD countries.\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nSo it's clear that things are changing.\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nConflicts are down on the continent;\n\n00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.958\nfrom about 12 conflicts a decade ago,\n\n00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nwe are down to three or four conflicts --\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:32.958\none of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:35.958\nAnd, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where\n\n00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nif something is going on in one part of the continent,\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nit looks like the entire continent is affected.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nBut you should know that this continent is not --\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nis a continent of many countries, not one country.\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nAnd if we are down to three or four conflicts,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nit means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:16:01.958\nin stable, growing, exciting economies\n\n00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.958\nwhere there's plenty of opportunity.\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nAnd I want to just make one point about this investment.\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nThe best way to help Africans today\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nis to help them to stand on their own feet.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:20.958\nAnd the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nThere's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nand saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:34.958\nBut imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed\n\n00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nand make sure that their children go to school,\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nthat they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:43.958\nIf we can invest in places where you yourselves make money\n\n00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:48.958\nwhilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,\n\n00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nisn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nAnd I want to say that some of the best people to invest in\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:58.958\non the continent are the women.\n\n00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:06.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nI have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:13.958\nOtherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.\n\n00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.958\nIt says, \"Africa: Open for Business.\"\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nAnd this is a video that has actually won an award\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.958\nas the best documentary of the year.\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nUnderstand that the woman who made it\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nis going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:35.958\nBut it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who\n\n00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:40.958\nagainst all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:43.958\nOne of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,\n\n00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nmaking children's clothes --\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwhich she started as a hobby and grew into a business.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nMixing African materials, such as we have,\n\n00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:55.958\nwith materials from elsewhere.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.958\nSo, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,\n\n00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nwith African material mixed in. Very creative designs,\n\n00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nhas reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.\n\n00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nFor 10,000 pieces.\n\n00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nSo that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:24.958\nAnd the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.\n\n00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nI could go on giving examples:\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nBeatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:35.958\nand is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning\n\n00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.958\nand is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.\n\n00:18:40.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nHowever, many of these are starved for capital to expand,\n\n00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.958\nbecause nobody believes outside of our countries\n\n00:18:48.958 --> 00:18:53.958\nthat we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.\n\n00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:56.958\nNobody thinks there's opportunity.\n\n00:18:56.958 --> 00:18:59.958\nBut I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,\n\n00:18:59.958 --> 00:19:01.958\nwill miss it forever.\n\n00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:07.958\nSo if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:14.958\nThink about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,\n\n00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nwho are doing incredible things, that are bringing them\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\ninto the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:23.958\nthat their fellow men and women are employed,\n\n00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.958\nand that the children in those households get educated\n\n00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nbecause their parents are earning adequate income.\n\n00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.958\nSo I invite you to explore the opportunities.\n\n00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:38.958\nWhen you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,\n\n00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:42.958\nbecause I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be\n\n00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:47.958\nfor you to get involved in something that will do good\n\n00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:52.958\nfor the continent, for the people and for yourselves.\n\n00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:53.958\nThank you very much.\n\n00:19:53.958 --> 00:20:01.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Rethink the desktop with BumpTop", "duration": "279", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/anand_agarawala_demos_his_bumptop_desktop", "transcript": "So, I kind of believe that we're in like the \"cave-painting\" era of computer interfaces. Like, they're very kind of \u2014 they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be and I'd like to change all that. Hit me. OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right? It's very flat, kind of rigid. And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac, you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years. (Laughter) (Applause) Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers. I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk. It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral \u2014 you know, what's visible, what's not. And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop. So I kind of have a \u2014 this is BumpTop. It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing. So you can bump things \u2014 they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff. And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull, things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk, I can \u2014 let me just grab these guys \u2014 I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have. And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid, or you know, flip through them like a book or I can lay them out like a deck of cards. When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right? And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that? I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way. Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought \u2014 I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further? And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right? (Laughter) So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right? This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties. And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system. So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later. Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner. Also just like paper, around our workspace we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later, and I can do the same thing here, and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices. And I can pull them off when I want to work with them.So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, \"Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.\" So one thing we have for that is like a grid align, kind of \u2014 so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned. More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping. And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke. I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software \u2014 I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop \u2014 but browsing photographs. I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing. I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable \u2014 and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it. And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before. So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know \u2014 okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here, and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.And that's BumpTop.

Just like on my real desk,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.958\nI can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:34.958\ninstead of just the folders that we have.\n\n00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.958\nAnd once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,\n\n00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:41.958\nor you know, flip through them like a book\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:46.958\nor I can lay them out like a deck of cards.\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:51.958\nWhen they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nor just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nAnd then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nAlso, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:09.958\nI just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top.

Thanks!"}, {"title": "We can be Buddhas", "duration": "726", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bob_thurman_says_we_can_be_buddhas", "transcript": "Thank you. And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me. I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra, an ancient work from ancient India in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali, and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him. All the young people, actually, from the city. The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha, because when he came to their city he accepted \u2014 he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is, and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person, raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling: \"He's supposed to be religious and all this. What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,\" and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him. They wouldn't go listen to him. But the young people all came. And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground. And as soon as they had laid all these, all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India, he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium, the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it, and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets. So they don't \u2014 when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky \u2014 they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding. They actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.He made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected. And then Leilei \u2014 I know his other name \u2014 told us about interconnection, and how we're all totally interconnected here, and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe, we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past. And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth. And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters, if that's a modern form of enlightenment. I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness, of where everybody can really know everything that's going on everywhere in the planet.And therefore it will become intolerable \u2014 what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us, totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is, and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place, or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth. It just becomes intolerable. With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do. Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do, a little bit tired, we do suffer. We do enjoy our misery in a certain way. We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere, but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there. And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own, and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.Because our egocentric perception \u2014 from the Buddha's point of view, misperception \u2014 is that all we are is what is inside our skin. And it's inside and outside, self and other, and other is all very different. And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception, a little bit, right? You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat \u2014 that's OK because you're in a theater, but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you, you'd freak out. What do they want from me? Like, who's that? And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it's you versus the universe \u2014 that's all Buddha discovered. Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us, and everyone else is different, then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it? Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world? Who's going to get enough out of the world? Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings \u2014 if you're different from all the other beings?So where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way: through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually, knowing that you have no such boundary, knowing your interconnectedness with other beings. You can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them. When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel. Luckily, they say \u2014 I still am not sure \u2014 but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the Buddhist literature, they say, \"Oh who would really want to be compassionate? How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching. My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied. I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough. I need a hundred billion.\" So I'm like that. Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering. It would be terrible.But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life. When you're no longer locked in yourself, and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out, and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing, and realizing that you are the other being, somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can, you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine, like the Beatles used to sing.You know, we really learned everything in the '60s. Too bad nobody ever woke up to it, and they've been trying to suppress it since then. I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching. But when we're relieved from that, we somehow then become interested in all the other beings. And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange. It's totally strange. The Dalai Lama always likes to say \u2014 he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion, it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence. It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know \u2014 and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets. Like, even when you're having a good time, when is the good time over? The good time is over when you think, how good is it? And then it's never good enough.I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time, doing it by having a good time. I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that. He once told me \u2014 he looked kind of sad; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots. He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago, they went and took everything away from the haves. You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth. They took it all away by violence, saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse. They didn't help at all.So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today? And so then he looks at me. So I said, \"Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,\" was all I could think of. What is virtue? But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun. It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key. Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring, and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly. Even though his people are being genocided \u2014 and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head, in every Chinese prison. He feels it. He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays. I won't even say what they do. But he feels it. And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.Because when you open up like that, then you can't just \u2014 what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery? You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is, how it can be changed. Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man. She scared us with the lava man is coming, then the tsunami is coming, but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful. It's really lovely.So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others, and the human being actually is compassion. The human being is almost out of time. The human being is compassion because what is our brain for? Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac. But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did. He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings. And he would have tremendous fun doing that.So the first person who gets happy, when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I, where you're always dissatisfied \u2014 as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way. So then you decide, \"Well, I'm sick of myself. I'm going to think of how other people can be happy. I'm going to get up in the morning and think, what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?\" And the first person who gets happy when you do that, you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself, because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it. And you realize that this \u2014 being with these people \u2014 is the flower garden that Chiho showed us. It is Nirvana. And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.

Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there\n\n00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.958\nthe total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.958\nAnd of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.958\nwith human life on it,\n\n00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.958\nand enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.958\nSo they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nin the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nor rocks or flames or gases exploding.\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nThey actually see landscapes and human beings\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nand gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nHe made that special effect at the beginning\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nto get everyone to think about interconnection\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nand interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nAnd then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.958\nand how we're all totally interconnected here,\n\n00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nand how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nwe've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nAnd I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.958\nAnd we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nif that's a modern form of enlightenment.\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.958\nI guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nof all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nof where everybody can really know everything\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nthat's going on everywhere in the planet.\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.958\nAnd therefore it will become intolerable --\n\n00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nwhat compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:30.958\ntotally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nthe life of the mind or whatever it is,\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nand there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nand they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nor they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nIt just becomes intolerable.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:51.958\nWith all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology\n\n00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nto become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nAnd of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nBecause we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.958\na little bit tired, we do suffer.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe do enjoy our misery in a certain way.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.958\nWe distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,\n\n00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nbut basically we all have this common misery\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nthat we are sort of stuck inside our skins\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nand everyone else is out there.\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nAnd occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.958\nand the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,\n\n00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:36.958\nand ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:42.958\nBecause our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nis that all we are is what is inside our skin.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.958\nAnd it's inside and outside, self and other,\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.958\nand other is all very different.\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nAnd everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.958\na little bit, right?\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nYou know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,\n\n00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nbut if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.958\nyou'd freak out.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nWhat do they want from me? Like, who's that?\n\n00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:10.958\nAnd so you wouldn't sit that close to another person\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nbecause of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:21.958\nBecause that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,\n\n00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nand everyone else is different,\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nthen that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nWho is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?\n\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nWho's going to get enough out of the world?\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nWho's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nif you're different from all the other beings?\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nSo where compassion comes is where you\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:48.958\nsurprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:\n\n00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthrough art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nknowing that you have no such boundary,\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nknowing your interconnectedness with other beings.\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nYou can experience yourself as the other beings\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:06.958\nwhen you see through the delusion of being separated from them.\n\n00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nWhen you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nLuckily, they say -- I still am not sure --\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nbut luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.958\nin the Buddhist literature, they say, \"Oh who would really want to be compassionate?\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nHow awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.\n\n00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.958\nMy bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.\n\n00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nI never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nI need a hundred billion.\" So I'm like that.\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nImagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nIt would be terrible.\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nBut apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.958\nWhen you're no longer locked in yourself,\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:52.958\nand as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge\n\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nof the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.958\nand realizing that you are the other being,\n\n00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nsomehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nyou get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.958\nlike the Beatles used to sing.\n\n00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nYou know, we really learned everything in the '60s.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nToo bad nobody ever woke up to it,\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nand they've been trying to suppress it since then.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nI, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nBut when we're relieved from that,\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nwe somehow then become interested in all the other beings.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nIt's totally strange.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nThe Dalai Lama always likes to say --\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nhe says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.958\nit's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures\n\n00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:03.958\nare finally too small a theater for your intelligence.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nIt's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:14.958\nand the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nLike, even when you're having a good time,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nwhen is the good time over?\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nThe good time is over when you think, how good is it?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nAnd then it's never good enough.\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nI love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\non the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.958\ndoing it by having a good time.\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.958\nI think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.\n\n00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:42.958\nHe once told me -- he looked kind of sad;\n\n00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nhe worries very much about the haves and have-nots.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nHe looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.958\nthey went and took everything away from the haves.\n\n00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nYou know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nThey took it all away by violence,\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nsaying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nThey didn't help at all.\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nSo what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd so then he looks at me.\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nSo I said, \"Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,\"\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nwas all I could think of. What is virtue?\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nBut of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nis that it is more fun.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nIt should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:37.958\nEverybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nand they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.958\nEven though his people are being genocided --\n\n00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nand believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.958\nin every Chinese prison. He feels it.\n\n00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nHe feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nI won't even say what they do. But he feels it.\n\n00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.958\nAnd yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.\n\n00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nBecause when you open up like that,\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:11.958\nthen you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?\n\n00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nYou have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.958\nhow it can be changed.\n\n00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.958\nLook at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.\n\n00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:23.958\nShe scared us with the lava man is coming,\n\n00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nthen the tsunami is coming,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nbut then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nIt's really lovely.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nSo, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nand the human being actually is compassion.\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nThe human being is almost out of time.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.958\nThe human being is compassion because what is our brain for?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nNow, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nBut he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nHe could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nAnd he would have tremendous fun doing that.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nSo the first person who gets happy,\n\n00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nwhen you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nwhere you're always dissatisfied --\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:23.958\nas Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nSo then you decide, \"Well, I'm sick of myself.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nI'm going to think of how other people can be happy.\n\n00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nI'm going to get up in the morning and think,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.958\nwhat can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,\n\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nmy pet, my butterfly?\"\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nAnd the first person who gets happy when you do that,\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nyou don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.958\nbecause your whole perception broadens\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nand you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nAnd you realize that this -- being with these people --\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:54.958\nis the flower garden that Chiho showed us.\n\n00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nIt is Nirvana.\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nAnd my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.958\nThank you."}, {"title": "A memorial at Ground Zero", "duration": "1477", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/david_rockwell_builds_at_ground_zero", "transcript": "Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent \u2014 or at least pretends to be \u2014 that he asked me to question him rather than speaking. In fact what we're going to talk about, I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address. And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center, many people have flocked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground. Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene.Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty. There's a new place in New York where the crowds are thickest \u2014 Ground Zero.Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis. This was \u2014 out of all the tourist sites in New York City \u2014 this was her number-one pick.JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.JA: Even on the coldest winter days. To honor and remember.Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here. This is ours.JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become a bit of a problem.Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on.JA: But that is about to change. In record time, a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer.Man: They'll get an incredible panorama and understand, I think more completely, the sheer totality of the destruction of the place.JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America. Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument, people come here to see what's no longer there.David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground.JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter.Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.JA: The ramps are made of simple material \u2014 the kind of plywood you see at construction sites \u2014 which is really the whole point. In the face of America's worst destruction people are building again. Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment, but certainly David you are known as \u2014 I know, a phrase you hate \u2014 an entertainment architect. Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.DR: I like that word.KA: It's about pleasure \u2014 casinos and hotels and restaurants. How did the shock that all of us \u2014 and especially all of us in New York \u2014 felt on the 11th of September transmute into your desire to do this thing?DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th, I felt myself in the role originally \u2014 first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated, and as someone who works less than a mile from there \u2014 that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating. In fact we're finishing a book which is called \"Pleasure,\" which is about sensual pleasure in spaces.But I've got to tell you \u2014 it became impossible to do that. We were really paralyzed. And I found myself the Friday after September 11th \u2014 two days afterwards \u2014 literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything. We gave the office a few days off.And in discussing this with other architects, we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were \u2014 they should rebuild them 50 stories taller. And I thought it was astonishing to speculate, as if this were a competition, on something that was such a fresh wound. And I had a series of discussions \u2014 first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this, and several other people \u2014 and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something. And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios, but to help right now. So we tried to come up with a way, as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team. And that was the mission that we came up with.KA: Were you conscious of suddenly \u2014 as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants \u2014 suddenly fulfilling needs?DR: Well what I was aware of was, there was this overwhelming need to act now. And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this. There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero. They moved to an abandoned school. We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days \u2014 it was like this urban barn-raising \u2014 to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help. It was just extraordinary. Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us.KA: And that was done, effectively, by October 8 or something?DR: Yeah.KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project \u2014 and this is only one of four that you've designed to surround the site \u2014 you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine, entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics.DR: Well, it's a funny thing. We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group. I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild. And I sat in on several meetings. And there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city. And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled, and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process. And it wasn't an inclusive group. So we said, what is \u2014KA: It was not an inclusive group?DR: It was not an inclusive group. It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group that was not representative of the city.KA: Shocking.DR: Yeah, surprising. So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea. The city actually approached us. We first approached the city about Pier 94. We saw how PS 234 worked. The families \u2014 the victims of the families \u2014 were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.KA: On the Hudson River?DR: Yeah. And the city actually \u2014 through Tim Zagat initially, and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani \u2014 said, \"You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now, but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families, and a way to protect it from the weather.\"So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin, and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life. It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it, where the families of the victims had left notes to them. And there was no mediation between us and the experience. There was no filter.And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street, the roof of our building \u2014 we can see the World Trade Towers prominently \u2014 and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up. And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there. And it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV. There was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience. So seeing this in a very simple, dignified way was a very powerful experience.So we went back to the city and said we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform, but we've spent some time down there. At the same time the city had this need. They were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there, that had nowhere to go. And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site. So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan. There was a way \u2014 there had to be a way \u2014 to get people to move around the site.KA: But then you've got to figure out a way \u2014 we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board \u2014 but simply funding this thing. It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen. And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the \u2014 we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management. This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this, and they sensed that this needed to happen.KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock, because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this \u2014 we had to work with the families of the victims, through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening. Because this didn't want to be a surprise. And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York, because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible.We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation, mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this, he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money. There needed to be a foundation in place. So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was one major developer in New York \u2014KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center, if that helps anyone \u2014 volunteered to help. And we met with him. The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars. And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country, volunteered to do it at cost. So this developer said, \"You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.\" And we said, \"That's incredible!\"And I think this was the 21st, and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th. And we had to start construction the next day. We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice, and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it.KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess? (Laughter)DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding. There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul \u2014 that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified, and a place to reflect and remember. And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul \u2014 which is just to the right \u2014 and moving around the site. And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.And I think people were amazed at two things \u2014 I think they were amazed at the destruction, but I think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving. Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said, \"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.\" And we said, \"Well, this is half the size, it doesn't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone \u2014 everyone in the city. We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.\" And I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed.The next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding. So we didn't know what to do, but we decided to cast a very wide net. We emailed out letters to as many people as we could \u2014 several people in the audience here \u2014 who were very helpful.KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead. He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead. We knew that one way or another this was going to happen. And we just felt it had to happen.KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation. Richard, I think very correctly, made the point at the beginning \u2014 before all the chair designers came out \u2014 about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting. It seems to me with this, that it was the opposite of that. This was an unprecedented, singular design problem.DR: Well here's the issue: we knew that this was not in the sense of \u2014 we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial. It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial. That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember \u2014 a kind of quiet place.So it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer \u2014 as we said about the families' platform \u2014 and the experience as possible. It's all incredibly humble material. It's scaffolding and plywood. And it allows \u2014 by sort of the procession of the movement, up by Saint Paul's and down the other side \u2014 it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view.But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible. One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable. Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site, one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform, we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions, and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.KA: Your work \u2014 I mean, we've talked about this before \u2014 a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things, and a kind of \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\" sort of sense of existence. This is clearly not a work for the ages. You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here. Did that require, as an architect, a new way of thinking about what you were doing? To think of it as this purely temporary installation?DR: No, I don't think so. I think this is, obviously, substantially different from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it. Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is, number one \u2014 the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done. And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller and all the people within the city \u2014 Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding, offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it. So the notion of collaboration \u2014 I think this reinforces how important that is.And in terms of the temporary nature of it, our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be. I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city, about what's really happening there.And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address, where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial. Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people. And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue. And that's what we were interested in. So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure. It enables that conversation to get serious. And six months after the fact \u2014 and only a few months away from the site being cleaned \u2014 we are very quickly, now, getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious. Do you have \u2014 having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project \u2014 have any ideas about what should or shouldn't be done?DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate \u2014 I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan. The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings, which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.KA: But it had some really terrible ideas.DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas, where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses. And I think there should be a broader \u2014 which there's starting to be \u2014 the dialogue is really opening up to, what does this site really want to be? And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out, that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion. There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive, about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over, so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.KA: Well, I think that's interesting. And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now, which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture, as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza. Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining \u2014 a silver lining, here \u2014 to rebuild some more traditional city grid, or not?DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities. And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day? I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces, regardless of what the number is. So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?DR: Right, which the towers fell into. And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city. I think a public dialogue \u2014 I think, you know, I'd like to see an international competition, and a call for ideas for uses.KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing, whether it's what amount of shopping?DR: Right. And we're looking for other things. This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help. Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice in New York to do artist housing. And find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions, and more about a multiplicity of things.KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform?DR: John Kamen \u2014 who's here, actually \u2014 put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use. So I thought that would be good to end with.DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west. One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was. And essentially our structure was designed to be written on.KA: As you say, it's not a memorial. But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial? Those kinds of forms?DR: We certainly did as much research as we could, and we were conscious of other memorials. And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do. It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City, which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already.The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable.What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed, so that what you're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero, but all of the buildings around it \u2014 and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous. This shows Saint Paul's on the left.KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers for making this happen and getting this done. But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection, and its being there, almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished, is part of its extraordinary \u2014 I don't know if beauty is the word \u2014 but presence.DR: It was an honor to do. And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.", "id": 8, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.958\nKurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight\n\n00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.958\nbut is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --\n\n00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.958\nthat he asked me to question him rather than speaking.\n\n00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.958\nIn fact what we're going to talk about,\n\n00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:34.958\nI think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served\n\n00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:35.958\nby a conversation than an address.\n\n00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:42.958\nAnd I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede.\n\n00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:48.958\nDan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,\n\n00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.958\nmany people have flocked to downtown New York to see\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:55.958\nand pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.\n\n00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:59.958\nNow, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.958\non a new way for people to visit and view the scene.\n\n00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:06.958\nJim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.\n\n00:01:06.958 --> 00:01:08.958\nThere's a new place in New York\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:10.958\nwhere the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero.\n\n00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.958\nTourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.\n\n00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.958\nThis was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City --\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:19.958\nthis was her number-one pick.\n\n00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.958\nJA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:27.958\nTourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened.\n\n00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.958\nJA: Even on the coldest winter days.\n\n00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.958\nTo honor and remember.\n\n00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.958\nTourist: It's reality, it's us.

on.\n\n00:01:45.958 --> 00:01:47.958\nJA: But that is about to change.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.958\nIn record time,\n\n00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.958\na team of architects and construction workers\n\n00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:57.958\ndesigned and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:58.958\nand bring people closer.\n\n00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:01.958\nMan: They'll get an incredible panorama\n\n00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.958\nand understand, I think more completely,\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:08.958\nthe sheer totality of the destruction of the place.\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:10.958\nJA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike\n\n00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nmost any other tourist site in America.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nUnlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:19.958\npeople come here to see what's no longer there.\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.958\nDavid Rockwell: The first experience people will have here\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.958\nwhen they see this is not as a construction site\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.958\nbut as this incredibly moving burial ground.\n\n00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.958\nJA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.958\nwith their own memorials the way they already have\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.958\nalong the current perimeter.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:38.958\nTourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much.\n\n00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nJA: The ramps are made of simple material --\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:42.958\nthe kind of plywood you see at construction sites --\n\n00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nwhich is really the whole point.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.958\nIn the face of America's worst destruction\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:50.958\npeople are building again.\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.958\nJim Axelrod, CBS News, New York.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.958\nKA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,\n\n00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:04.958\nbut certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate --\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nan entertainment architect.\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nYour work is highly sensual, even hedonistic.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.958\nDR: I like that word.\n\n00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nKA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.958\nHow did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York --\n\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nfelt on the 11th of September transmute\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.958\ninto your desire to do this thing?\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nDR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.958\nI felt myself in the role originally --\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.958\nfirst of all as someone who lives in Tribeca\n\n00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nand whose neighborhood was devastated,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nand as someone who works less than a mile from there --\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:59.958\nin my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm\n\n00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nabout creating the places we had been creating.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn fact we're finishing a book which is called \"Pleasure,\"\n\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:08.958\nwhich is about sensual pleasure in spaces.\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nBut I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:13.958\nWe were really paralyzed.\n\n00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nAnd I found myself the Friday after September 11th --\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\ntwo days afterwards --\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.958\nliterally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.\n\n00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.958\nWe gave the office a few days off.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nAnd in discussing this with other architects,\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nwe had seen people saying in the press\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nthat they should rebuild the towers as they were --\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nthey should rebuild them 50 stories taller.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.958\nAnd I thought it was astonishing to speculate,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.958\nas if this were a competition,\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:47.958\non something that was such a fresh wound.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nAnd I had a series of discussions --\n\n00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nfirst with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,\n\n00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nand several other people --\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nand really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.\n\n00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nAnd that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nwasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nbut to help right now.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.958\nSo we tried to come up with a way,\n\n00:05:16.958 --> 00:05:18.958\nas a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nAnd that was the mission that we came up with.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nKA: Were you conscious of suddenly --\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nas a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants --\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nsuddenly fulfilling needs?\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.958\nDR: Well what I was aware of was,\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nthere was this overwhelming need to act now.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:46.958\nAnd we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nThere was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nThey moved to an abandoned school.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nWe took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.958\nand over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising --\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nto renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.958\nIt was just extraordinary.\n\n00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nTom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.958\nand it became this cathartic experience for us.\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nKA: And that was done, effectively,\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nby October 8 or something?\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nDR: Yeah.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nKA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nas substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nthat you've designed to surround the site --\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:34.958\nyou must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,\n\n00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nentrenched bureaucracy and powers that be\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.958\nin New York real estate and New York politics.\n\n00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nDR: Well, it's a funny thing.\n\n00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:46.958\nWe finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nI was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nAnd I sat in on several meetings.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nAnd there were the most circuitous grand plans\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nthat had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:08.958\nAnd the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,\n\n00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:11.958\nand there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.\n\n00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd it wasn't an inclusive group.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nSo we said, what is --\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:16.958\nKA: It was not an inclusive group?\n\n00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:18.958\nDR: It was not an inclusive group.\n\n00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:21.958\nIt was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group\n\n00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nthat was not representative of the city.\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nKA: Shocking.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nDR: Yeah, surprising.\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nSo Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThe city actually approached us.\n\n00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nWe first approached the city about Pier 94.\n\n00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.958\nWe saw how PS 234 worked.\n\n00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nThe families -- the victims of the families --\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nwere going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:49.958\nKA: On the Hudson River?\n\n00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nDR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nand then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani --\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nsaid, \"You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nbut we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nthat we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nand a way to protect it from the weather.\"\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nSo I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nand I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nIt was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nwhere the families of the victims had left notes to them.\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd there was no mediation between us and the experience.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nThere was no filter.\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nAnd I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:37.958\nthe roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently --\n\n00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nand I saw the first building collapse from a conference room\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.958\non the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.\n\n00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nAnd then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.\n\n00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.958\nAnd it was amazing how much harder it was\n\n00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.958\nto believe in real life than it was on TV.\n\n00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nThere was something about the comfort of the filter\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:01.958\nand how much information was between us and the experience.\n\n00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:03.958\nSo seeing this in a very simple,\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:07.958\ndignified way was a very powerful experience.\n\n00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.958\nSo we went back to the city and said\n\n00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nwe're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nbut we've spent some time down there.\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:22.958\nAt the same time the city had this need.\n\n00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:24.958\nThey were looking for a solution\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nto deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day\n\n00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.958\nwho were going down there, that had nowhere to go.\n\n00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:32.958\nAnd there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.\n\n00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nSo dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nThere was a way -- there had to be a way --\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\nto get people to move around the site.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nKA: But then you've got to figure out a way --\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:47.958\nwe will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits\n\n00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nand getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\nIt looks like a fairly simple thing,\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.958\nbut this was a half a million dollar project?\n\n00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:57.958\nDR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,\n\n00:09:57.958 --> 00:09:59.958\nit wasn't going to happen.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\nAnd we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nby the end of the Giuliani administration,\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.958\nthen everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT\n\n00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.958\nand the Police Department and all of the --\n\n00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nwe were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.958\nand it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.\n\n00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:19.958\nThis incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nand they sensed that this needed to happen.\n\n00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:24.958\nKA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,\n\n00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbecause Giuliani was obviously out three months after that.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nDR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this --\n\n00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nwe had to work with the families of the victims,\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.958\nthrough the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.\n\n00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nBecause this didn't want to be a surprise.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:45.958\nAnd we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nbecause the key was not raising a lot of objection\n\n00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nand sort of working as quietly as possible.\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nWe came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nmainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nhe would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:08.958\nThere needed to be a foundation in place.\n\n00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nSo we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\none major developer in New York --\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:17.958\nKA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess?\n\n00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:20.958\nDR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,\n\n00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nif that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.958\nAnd we met with him.\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThe prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.958\nAnd Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,\n\n00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nvolunteered to do it at cost.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nSo this developer said, \"You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.\"\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nAnd we said, \"That's incredible!\"\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nAnd I think this was the 21st,\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:49.958\nand we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.958\nAnd we had to start construction the next day.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWe had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nand the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nabout half the size that we had drawn it.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:05.958\nKA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nthe tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:14.958\nDR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.\n\n00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:18.958\nThere was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul --\n\n00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:22.958\nthat this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,\n\n00:12:22.958 --> 00:12:24.958\nand a place to reflect and remember.\n\n00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:27.958\nAnd I've got to say that we spent a lot of time\n\n00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nin putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul --\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nwhich is just to the right -- and moving around the site.\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.958\nAnd I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need.\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:40.958\nAnd I think people were amazed at two things --\n\n00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nI think they were amazed at the destruction,\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nbut I think there was a sense of disbelief\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:49.958\nabout the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.\n\n00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nJust the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nSo we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:12:59.958\n\"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:03.958\nwill not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.\"\n\n00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd we said, \"Well, this is half the size,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nit doesn't have any of the design features\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:11.958\nthat have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city.\n\n00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.958\nWe'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.\"\n\n00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd I convinced him that we should leave the room\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwith the agreement to build it as designed.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nThe next day I got an email from the developer\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nsaying that he was withdrawing all funding.\n\n00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nSo we didn't know what to do,\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nbut we decided to cast a very wide net.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nWe emailed out letters to as many people as we could --\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.958\nseveral people in the audience here -- who were very helpful.\n\n00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nKA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point?\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nDR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.958\nHe had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.958\nWe knew that one way or another this was going to happen.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nAnd we just felt it had to happen.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nKA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nRichard, I think very correctly,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nmade the point at the beginning --\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nbefore all the chair designers came out --\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:21.958\nabout the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions\n\n00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:25.958\non this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.\n\n00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:29.958\nIt seems to me with this,\n\n00:14:29.958 --> 00:14:31.958\nthat it was the opposite of that.\n\n00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nThis was an unprecedented, singular design problem.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nDR: Well here's the issue:\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:40.958\nwe knew that this was not in the sense of --\n\n00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:46.958\nwe think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:49.958\nIt was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.\n\n00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:55.958\nThat this was a place for people to reflect, to remember --\n\n00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:57.958\na kind of quiet place.\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nSo it led us to using design solutions\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nthat created as few filters between the viewer --\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nas we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible.\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nIt's all incredibly humble material.\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nIt's scaffolding and plywood.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nAnd it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:22.958\nup by Saint Paul's and down the other side --\n\n00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nit gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.958\nto where you get the 360 degree view.\n\n00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:37.958\nBut the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.\n\n00:15:37.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nOne of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nBecause when we looked at the four platforms around the site,\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:47.958\none of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,\n\n00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:49.958\nwe knew that these had to be moveable\n\n00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:51.958\nto respond to changing conditions,\n\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nand the changing definition of what Ground Zero is.\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nKA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before --\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:06.958\na lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on\n\n00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:10.958\nthe temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,\n\n00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:14.958\nand a kind of \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,\"\n\n00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.958\nsort of sense of existence.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:22.958\nThis is clearly not a work for the ages.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:26.958\nYou know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nDid that require, as an architect,\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\na new way of thinking about what you were doing?\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nTo think of it as this purely temporary installation?\n\n00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.958\nDR: No, I don't think so.\n\n00:16:38.958 --> 00:16:42.958\nI think this is, obviously, substantially different\n\n00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.958\nfrom anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:52.958\nWhere it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,\n\n00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nnumber one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:01.958\nAnd Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nand all the people within the city --\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nNorman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\noffered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:17.958\nSo the notion of collaboration --\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:20.958\nI think this reinforces how important that is.\n\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.958\nAnd in terms of the temporary nature of it,\n\n00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nour goal was not to create something\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.958\nthat would be there longer than it needed to be.\n\n00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:34.958\nI think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue\n\n00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nthat we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.958\nabout what's really happening there.\n\n00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:47.958\nAnd a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,\n\n00:17:47.958 --> 00:17:50.958\nwhere he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.\n\n00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.958\nWhich was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.\n\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd I think regardless of what the position is about how\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:02.958\nthis sacred piece of land is to be used,\n\n00:18:02.958 --> 00:18:07.958\nhaving it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,\n\n00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nI think makes it a more powerful dialogue.\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:11.958\nAnd that's what we were interested in.\n\n00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:14.958\nSo that, very much, is in the realm of things\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:16.958\nI've been interested in before.\n\n00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:19.958\nKA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.\n\n00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.958\nIt enables that conversation to get serious.\n\n00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:26.958\nAnd six months after the fact --\n\n00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:30.958\nand only a few months away from the site being cleaned --\n\n00:18:30.958 --> 00:18:32.958\nwe are very quickly, now, getting to the point\n\n00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:37.958\nwhere those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.\n\n00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:42.958\nDo you have -- having been as physically involved in the site\n\n00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:44.958\nas you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about\n\n00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:46.958\nwhat should or shouldn't be done?\n\n00:18:46.958 --> 00:18:51.958\nDR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate --\n\n00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:57.958\nI think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.\n\n00:18:57.958 --> 00:19:02.958\nThe Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,\n\n00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.958\nwhich had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings.\n\n00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:08.958\nKA: But it had some really terrible ideas.\n\n00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:12.958\nDR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,\n\n00:19:12.958 --> 00:19:17.958\nwhere I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.\n\n00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.958\nAnd I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be --\n\n00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.958\nthe dialogue is really opening up to,\n\n00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.958\nwhat does this site really want to be?\n\n00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:28.958\nAnd I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,\n\n00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:31.958\nthat it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.\n\n00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:36.958\nThere's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,\n\n00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.958\nabout depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,\n\n00:19:40.958 --> 00:19:43.958\nso that there's one uninterrupted piece of land.\n\n00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.958\nKA: Well, I think that's interesting.\n\n00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.958\nAnd it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate\n\n00:19:48.958 --> 00:19:50.958\nto discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,\n\n00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:56.958\nwhich is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,\n\n00:19:56.958 --> 00:20:00.958\nas what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.\n\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:03.958\nIs this an opportunity, is the silver lining --\n\n00:20:03.958 --> 00:20:05.958\na silver lining, here -- to rebuild\n\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:09.958\nsome more traditional city grid, or not?\n\n00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.958\nDR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage\n\n00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:13.958\nin a discussion of why we live in cities.\n\n00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:17.958\nAnd why do we live in places where such dissimilar people\n\n00:20:17.958 --> 00:20:19.958\ncollide up against us each day?\n\n00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:24.958\nI don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,\n\n00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.958\nregardless of what the number is.\n\n00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:30.958\nSo yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities.\n\n00:20:30.958 --> 00:20:36.958\nAnd in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven.\n\n00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:38.958\nKA: Which was the building just north of the Towers?\n\n00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:40.958\nDR: Right, which the towers fell into.\n\n00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:45.958\nAnd the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage\n\n00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:47.958\nthat they're not re-opening the street\n\n00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:49.958\nto connect that back to the rest of the city.\n\n00:20:49.958 --> 00:20:52.958\nI think a public dialogue -- I think, you know,\n\n00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:56.958\nI'd like to see an international competition,\n\n00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.958\nand a call for ideas for uses.\n\n00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.958\nKA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,\n\n00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:03.958\nwhether it's what amount of shopping?\n\n00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:05.958\nDR: Right. And we're looking for other things.\n\n00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:08.958\nThis small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.\n\n00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:12.958\nIncluding taking a small piece adjacent to the site\n\n00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:16.958\nand inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice\n\n00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:18.958\nin New York to do artist housing.\n\n00:21:18.958 --> 00:21:20.958\nAnd find other ways to encourage the discussion\n\n00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:23.958\nto be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,\n\n00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:27.958\nand more about a multiplicity of things.\n\n00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:34.958\nKA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video\n\n00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:37.958\nof the experience of being on this platform?\n\n00:21:37.958 --> 00:21:40.958\nDR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together\n\n00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:43.958\na two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.\n\n00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:48.958\nSo I thought that would be good to end with.\n\n00:21:58.958 --> 00:22:04.958\nDR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.\n\n00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:08.958\nOne of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration\n\n00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:11.958\nwas I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.\n\n00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:18.958\nAnd essentially our structure was designed to be written on.\n\n00:22:18.958 --> 00:22:20.958\nKA: As you say, it's not a memorial.\n\n00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.958\nBut were you conscious of memorials?

And the answer I like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war. And what I've spent 15 years doing in this business \u2014 and it's taken me almost 14 to figure it out \u2014 is I think about the future of wars in the context of everything else. So I tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace. The material I'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas. It's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit. The material was generated in two years of work I did for the Secretary of Defense, thinking about a new national grand strategy for the United States. I'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer.Here's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the Pentagon: the theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies. Why do we call it that? Because it's got all those A's lined up I guess. This is gobbledygook for if the United States fights somebody we're going to be huge. They're going to be small. And if they try to fight us in the traditional, straight-up manner we're going to kick their ass, which is why people don't try to do that any more. I met the last Air Force General who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat. He's now a one star General. That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours. So that overmatched capability creates problems \u2014 catastrophic successes the White House calls them.(Laughter)And we're trying to figure that out, because it is an amazing capability. The question is, what's the good you can do with it? OK? The theory of anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies \u2014 gobbledygook that we sell to Congress, because if we just told them we can kick anybody's asses they wouldn't buy us all the stuff we want. So we say, area-denial, anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over.(Laughter)And they say, \"Will you build it in my district?\"(Laughter)(Applause)Here's my parody and it ain't much of one. Let's talk about a battle space. I don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025. Let's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space. I don't know, the Million Man Swim.(Laughter)The United States has to access that battle space instantaneously. They throw up anti-access, area-denial asymmetrical strategies. A banana peel on the tarmac.(Laughter)Trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly. We say, \"China, it's yours.\" Prometheus approach, largely a geographic definition, focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict. We field the first-half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game. That's the problem. We can run the score up against anybody, and then get our asses kicked in the second half \u2014 what they call fourth generation warfare.Here's the way I like to describe it instead. There is no battle space the U.S. Military cannot access. They said we couldn't do Afghanistan. We did it with ease. They said we couldn't do Iraq. We did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks. We did it so fast we weren't prepared for their collapse. There is nobody we can't take down. The question is, what do you do with the power?So there's no trouble accessing battle spaces. What we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow, and creating the peace space that allows us to move on. Problem is, the Defense Department over here beats the hell out of you. The State Department over here says, \"Come on boy, I know you can make it.\" And that poor country runs off that ledge, does that cartoon thing and then drops.(Laughter)This is not about overwhelming force, but proportional force. It's about non-lethal technologies, because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you're going to lose friends very quickly. This is not about projecting power, but about staying power, which is about legitimacy with the locals. Who do you access in this transition space?You have to create internal partners. You have to access coalition partners. We asked the Indians for 17,000 peace keepers. I know their senior leadership, they wanted to give it to us. But they said to us, \"You know what? In that transition space you're mostly hat not enough cattle. We don't think you can pull it off, we're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder.\" We asked the Russians for 40,000. They said no. I was in China in August, I said, \"You should have 50,000 peace keepers in Iraq. It's your oil, not ours.\" Which is the truth. It's their oil. And the Chinese said to me, \"Dr. Barnett, you're absolutely right. In a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there. But it's not a perfect world, and your administration isn't getting us any closer.\" But we have trouble accessing our outcomes.We lucked out, frankly, on the selection. We face different opponents across these three. And it's time to start admitting you can't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all, day in and day out. It's just too damn hard. We have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. We don't do the everything else so well. Frankly, we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it. We have a brilliant Secretary of War. We don't have a Secretary of Everything Else. Because if we did, that guy would be in front of the Senate, still testifying over Abu Ghraib. The problem is he doesn't exist. There is no Secretary of Everything Else. I think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war. I call that the Leviathan Force. What we need to build is a force for the Everything Else. I call them the System Administrators.What I think this really represents is lack of an A to Z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states. We have one for processing economically bankrupt states. It's the IMF Sovereign Bankruptcy Plan, OK? We argue about it every time we use it. Argentina just went through it, broke a lot of rules. They got out on the far end, we said, \"Fine, don't worry about it.\" It's transparent. A certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome. We don't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that, frankly, everybody wants gone. Like Saddam, like Mugabe, like Kim Jong-Il \u2014 people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions. Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.What would an A to Z system look like? I'm going to distinguish between what I call front half and back half. And let's call this red line, I don't know, mission accomplished.(Laughter)(Applause)What we have extant right now, at the beginning of this system, is the U.N. Security Council as a grand jury. What can they do? They can indict your ass. They can debate it. They can write it on a piece of paper. They can put it in an envelope and mail it to you, and then say in no uncertain terms, \"Please cut that out.\"(Laughter)That gets you about four million dead in Central Africa over the 1990s. That gets you 250,000 dead in the Sudan in the last 15 months. Everybody's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in Africa, and you better have an answer. We don't have anything to translate that will into action.What we do have is the U.S.-enabled Leviathan Force that says, \"You want me to take that guy down? I'll take that guy down. I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost you 20 billion dollars.\"(Laughter)But here's the deal. As soon as I can't find anybody else to air out, I leave the scene immediately. That's called the Powell Doctrine. Way downstream we have the International Criminal Court. They love to put them on trial. They've got Milosevi\u0107 right now.What are we missing? A functioning executive that will translate will into action, because we don't have it. Every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing. We haven't faced an imminent threat since the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. But we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we're a democracy and that's what it takes. And if that doesn't work we scream, \"He's got a gun!\" just as we rush in.(Laughter)And then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say, \"Jesus, it was dark.\"(Laughter)Do you want to do it, France? France says, \"No, but I do like to criticize you after the fact.\"What we need downstream is a great power enabled \u2014 what I call that Sys Admin Force. We should have had 250,000 troops streaming into Iraq on the heels of that Leviathan sweeping towards Baghdad. What do you get then? No looting, no military disappearing, no arms disappearing, no ammo disappearing, no Muqtada Al-Sadr \u2014 I'm wrecking his bones \u2014 no insurgency. Talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months. We had six months to feel the lob, to get the job done, and we dicked around for six months. And then they turned on us. Why? Because they just got fed up. They saw what we did to Saddam. They said, \"You're that powerful, you can resurrect this country. You're America.\"What we need is an international reconstruction fund \u2014 Sebastian Mallaby, Washington Post, great idea. Model on the IMF. Instead of passing the hat each time, OK? Where are we going to find this guy? G20, that's easy. Check out their agenda since 9/11. All security dominated. They're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the IMF. You vote according to how much money you put in the kitty. Here's my challenge to the Defense Department. You've got to build this force. You've got to seed this force. You've got to track coalition partners. Create a record of success. You will get this model. You tell me it's too hard to do. I'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the Balkans. We did it just like that. I'm talking about regularizing it, making it transparent. Would you like Mugabe gone? Would you like Kim Jong-Il, who's killed about two million people, would you like him gone? Would you like a better system? This is why it matters to the military. They've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War. I'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire, which I can do because I'm not inside the beltway.(Laughter)I'm talking about the 1990s. The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm. The split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with, and those who see a future that starts to scare them, like the U.S. submarine community, which watches the Soviet Navy disappear overnight. Ah!(Laughter)So they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization.(Laughter)The problem is you need a big, sexy opponent to fight against. And if you can't find one you've got to make one up. China, all grown up, going to be a looker!(Laughter)The rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it: military operations other than war. I ask you, who joins the military to do things other than war? Actually, most of them. Jessica Lynch never planned on shooting back. Most of them don't pick up a rifle. I maintain this is code inside the Army for, \"We don't want to do this.\" They spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world What I call the core and the gap. The Clinton administration wasn't interested in running this. For eight years, after screwing up the relationship on day one \u2014 inauguration day with gays in the military \u2014 which was deft.(Laughter)So we were home alone for eight years. And what did we do home alone? We bought one military and we operated another. It's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says, \"Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\"(Laughter)The doctor says, \"Stop doing that you idiot.\"I used to give this brief inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s. I'd say, \"You're buying one military and you're operating another, and eventually it's going to hurt. It's wrong. Bad Pentagon, bad!\"(Laughter)And they'd say, \"Dr. Barnett, you are so right. Can you come back next year and remind us again?\"(Laughter)Some people say 9/11 heals the rift \u2014 jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history, drags them down in to the muck and says, \"You want a networked opponent? I've got one, he's everywhere, go find him.\" It elevates MOOTW \u2014 how we pronounce that acronym \u2014 from crap to grand strategy, because that's how you're going to shrink that gap.Some people put these two things together and they call it empire, which I think is a boneheaded concept. Empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets, which you cannot do, but maximum rule sets which you must do. It's not our system of governance. Never how we've sought to interact with the outside world. I prefer that phrase System Administration. We enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy. Certain bad things you cannot do. How this impacts the way we think about the future of war. This is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the Pentagon. It makes me very popular as well. Everybody's got an opinion.Going back to the beginning of our country \u2014 historically, defenses meant protection of the homeland. Security has meant everything else. Written into our constitution, two different forces, two different functions. Raise an army when you need it, and maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity. A Department of War, a Department of Everything Else. A big stick, a baton stick. Can of whup ass, the networking force. In 1947 we merged these two things together in the Defense Department. Our long-term rationale becomes, we're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the Soviets. To attack America is to risk blowing up the world. We connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay. That's not our problem now. They can kill three million in Chicago tomorrow and we don't go to the mattresses with nukes. That's the scary part.The question is how do we reconnect American national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable, and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet? What's happened since is that bifurcation I described. We talked about this going all the way back to the end of the Cold War. Let's have a Department of War, and a Department of Something Else. Some people say, \"Hell, 9/11 did it for you.\" Now we've got a home game and an away game.(Laughter)The Department of Homeland Security is a strategic feel good measure. It's going to be the Department of Agriculture for the 21st century. TSA \u2014 thousands standing around.(Laughter)I supported the war in Iraq. He was a bad guy with multiple priors. It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him. I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force. I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed. But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure. What do I mean by these two different forces?This is the Hobbesian Force. I love this force. I don't want to see it go. That plus nukes rules out great power war. This is the military the rest of the world wants us to build. It's why I travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries.What does this mean? It means you've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old. Switching back, morning, afternoon, evening, morning, afternoon, evening. Handing out aid, shooting back, handing out aid, shooting back. It's too much. The 19-year-olds get tired from the switching, OK?(Laughter)That force on the left, you can train a 19-year-old to do that. That force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop. You need the experience. What does this mean in terms of operations?The rule is going to be this. That Sys Admin force is the force that never comes home, does most of your work. You break out that Leviathan Force only every so often. But here's the promise you make to the American public, to your own people, to the world. You break out that Leviathan Force, you promise, you guarantee that you're going to mount one hell of a \u2014 immediately \u2014 follow-on Sys Admin effort. Don't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace.(Applause)Other differences. Leviathan traditional partners, they all look like the Brits and their former colonies.(Laughter)Including us, I would remind you. The rest \u2014 wider array of partners. International organizations, non-governmental organizations, private voluntary organizations, contractors. You're not going to get away from that. Leviathan Force, it's all about joint operations between the military services. We're done with that. What we need to do is inter-agency operations, which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of. And I'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed.I call the Leviathan Force your dad's military. I like them young, male, unmarried, slightly pissed off.(Laughter)I call the Sys Admin Force your mom's military. It's everything the man's military hates. Gender balanced much more, older, educated, married with children. The force on the left, up or out. The force on the right, in and out. The force on the left respects Posse Comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the U.S. The force on the right's going to obliterate it. That's where the National Guard's going to be. The force on the left is never coming under the purview of the International Criminal Court. Sys Admin Force has to. Different definitions of network centricity. One takes down networks, one puts them up. And you've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that.Do we need a bigger budget? Do we need a draft to pull this off? Absolutely not. I've been told by the Revolution of Military Affairs crowd for years, we can do it faster, cheaper, smaller, just as lethal. I say, \"Great, I'm going to take the Sys Admin budget out of your hide.\"Here's the larger point. You're going to build the Sys Admin Force inside the U.S. Military first. But ultimately you're going to civilianize it, probably two thirds. Inter agency-ize it, internationalize it. So yes, it begins inside the Pentagon, but over time it's going to cross that river.(Laughter)I have been to the mountain top. I can see the future. I may not live long enough to get you there, but it's going to happen. We're going to have a Department of Something Else between war and peace.Last slide. Who gets custody of the kids? This is where the Marines in the audience get kind of tense. (Laughter) And this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk.(Laughter)Read Max Boon. This is the history of the marines \u2014 small wars, small arms. The Marines are like my West Highland Terrier. They get up every morning, they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something.(Laughter)I don't want my Marines handing out aid. I want them to be Marines. That's what keeps the Sys Admin Force from being a pussy force. It keeps it from being the U.N. You shoot at these people the Marines are going to come over and kill you.(Laughter)(Applause)Department of Navy, strategic subs go this way, surface combatants are over there, and the news is they may actually be that small.(Laughter)I call it the Smart Dust Navy. I tell young officers, \"You may command 500 ships in your career. Bad news is they may not have anybody on them.\" Carriers go both ways because they're a swing asset. You'll see the pattern \u2014 airborne, just like carriers. Armor goes this way. Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force, you can win by bombing. But you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace. Shinseki was right with the argument. Air force, strategic airlift goes both ways. Bombers, fighters go over here. Special Operations Command down at Tampa. Trigger-pullers go this way. Civil Affairs, that bastard child, comes over here. Return to the Army. The point about the trigger-pullers and Special Operations Command. No off season, these guys are always active. They drop in, do their business, disappear. See me now. Don't talk about it later.(Laughter)I was never here.(Laughter)The world is my playground.(Laughter)I want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy. I want the rules to be as loose as possible. Because when the thing gets prevented in Chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition, these are the guys who are going to kill them first. So it's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that.Reserve component \u2014 National Guard reserves overwhelmingly Sys Admin. How are you going to get them to work for this force? Most firemen in this country do it for free. This is not about money. This is about being up front with these guys and gals.Last point, intelligence community \u2014 the muscle and the defense agencies go this way. What should be the CIA, open, analytical, open source should come over here. The information you need to do this is not secret. It's not secret. Read that great piece in the New Yorker about how our echo boomers, 19 to 25, over in Iraq taught each other how to do Sys Admin work, over the Internet in chat rooms. They said, \"Al Qaeda could be listening.\" They said, \"Well, Jesus, they already know this stuff.\"(Laughter)Take a gift in the left hand. These are the sunglasses that don't scare people, simple stuff. Censors and transparency, the overheads go in both directions.Thanks.", "id": 33, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.625\nI get asked a

Secretary of Defense,\n\n00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.934\nthinking about a new\nnational grand strategy\n\n00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:55.108\nfor the United States.\n\n00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.213\nI'm going to present a problem\n\n00:00:57.237 --> 00:00:59.237\nand try to give you an answer.\n\n00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:03.934\nHere's my favorite bonehead concept\nfrom the 1990s in the Pentagon:\n\n00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:07.934\nthe theory of anti-access,\narea-denial asymmetrical strategies.\n\n00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:08.934\nWhy do we call it that?\n\n00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:12.958\nBecause it's got all those\nA's lined up I guess.\n\n00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.934\nThis is gobbledygook for\n\n00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.934\nif the United States fights\nsomebody we're going to be huge.\n\n00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:22.934\nThey're going to be small.\n\n00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.934\nAnd if they try to fight us\nin the traditional, straight-up manner\n\n00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:25.934\nwe're going to kick their ass,\n\n00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:28.934\nwhich is why people don't\ntry to do that any more.\n\n00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.934\nI met the last Air Force\nGeneral who had actually\n\n00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.934\nshot down an enemy plane in combat.\n\n00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:35.934\nHe's now a one star General.\n\n00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.934\nThat's how distant\nwe are from even meeting an air force\n\n00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:41.934\nwilling to fly against ours.\n\n00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:44.934\nSo that overmatched capability\ncreates problems --\n\n00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.934\ncatastrophic successes\nthe White House calls them.\n\n00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:52.934\nAnd we're trying to figure that out,\n\n00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:54.934\nbecause it is an amazing capability.\n\n00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.934\nThe question is, what's the good\nyou can do with it?\n\n00:01:57.958 --> 00:01:59.934\nOK?\n\n00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:03.934\nThe theory of anti-access, area-denial\nasymmetrical strategies --\n\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.934\ngobbledygook that we sell to Congress,\n\n00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.934\nbecause if we just told them\nwe can kick anybody's asses\n\n00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.006\nthey wouldn't buy us\nall the stuff we want.\n\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.934\nSo we say, area-denial, anti-access\nasymmetrical strategies\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.934\nand their eyes glaze over.\n\n00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:22.934\nAnd they say, \"Will you\nbuild it in my district?\"\n\n00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.934\n(Applause)\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:29.934\nHere's my parody and it ain't much of one.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:30.934\nLet's talk about a battle space.\n\n00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:32.934\nI don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.934\nLet's talk about an enemy embedded\nwithin that battle space.\n\n00:02:35.958 --> 00:02:37.934\nI don't know, the Million Man Swim.\n\n00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:44.101\nThe United States has to access\nthat battle space instantaneously.\n\n00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.934\nThey throw up anti-access,\narea-denial asymmetrical strategies.\n\n00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:49.934\nA banana peel on the tarmac.\n\n00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:50.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.934\nTrojan horses on our computer networks\n\n00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.934\nreveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.\n\n00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:57.934\nWe say, \"China, it's yours.\"\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:00.934\nPrometheus approach, largely\na geographic definition,\n\n00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:02.934\nfocuses almost exclusively\non the start of conflict.\n\n00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.934\nWe field the first-half team in a league\n\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:07.934\nthat insists on keeping score\nuntil the end of the game.\n\n00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.934\nThat's the problem.\n\n00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.934\nWe can run the score up against anybody,\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.387\nand then get our asses\nkicked in the second half --\n\n00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.934\nwhat they call fourth generation warfare.\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.101\nHere's the way\nI like to describe it instead.\n\n00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.934\nThere is no battle space the U.S.\nMilitary cannot access.\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.934\nThey said we couldn't do Afghanistan.\nWe did it with ease.\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.934\nThey said we couldn't do Iraq.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.934\nWe did it with 150 combat\ncasualties in six weeks.\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.934\nWe did it so fast we weren't\nprepared for their collapse.\n\n00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.934\nThere is nobody we can't take down.\n\n00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.934\nThe question is, what do\nyou do with the power?\n\n00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:41.149\nSo there's no trouble\naccessing battle spaces.\n\n00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:43.934\nWhat we have trouble accessing\nis the transition space\n\n00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.934\nthat must naturally follow,\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.958\nand creating the peace space\nthat allows us to move on.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.054\nProblem is, the Defense\nDepartment over here\n\n00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.078\nbeats the hell out of you.\n\n00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.499\nThe State Department over here says,\n\n00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:58.523\n\"Come on boy, I know you can make it.\"\n\n00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.934\nAnd that poor country runs off that ledge,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.934\ndoes that cartoon thing and then drops.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:08.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.934\nThis is not about overwhelming\nforce, but proportional force.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:12.934\nIt's about non-lethal technologies,\n\n00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.934\nbecause if you fire real ammo into a crowd\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nof women and children rioting\n\n00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:20.934\nyou're going to lose friends very quickly.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.816\nThis is not about projecting\npower, but about staying power,\n\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.934\nwhich is about legitimacy with the locals.\n\n00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:28.006\nWho do you access in this\ntransition space?\n\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.650\nYou have to create internal partners.\nYou have to access coalition partners.\n\n00:04:31.674 --> 00:04:33.934\nWe asked the Indians\nfor 17,000 peace keepers.\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.934\nI know their senior leadership,\nthey wanted to give it to us.\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.934\nBut they said to us, \"You know what?\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nIn that transition space you're\nmostly hat not enough cattle.\n\n00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:43.934\nWe don't think you can pull it off,\n\n00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.934\nwe're not going to give you\nour 17,000 peace keepers for fodder.\"\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.934\nWe asked the Russians for 40,000.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:49.934\nThey said no.\n\n00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.934\nI was in China in August, I said,\n\n00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.934\n\"You should have 50,000\npeace keepers in Iraq.\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.958\nIt's your oil, not ours.\"\n\n00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.934\nWhich is the truth. It's their oil.\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:02.101\nAnd the Chinese said to me, \"Dr.\nBarnett, you're absolutely right.\n\n00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.934\nIn a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.934\nBut it's not a perfect world,\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nand your administration isn't\ngetting us any closer.\"\n\n00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.006\nBut we have trouble\naccessing our outcomes.\n\n00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.934\nWe lucked out, frankly, on the selection.\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.934\nWe face different opponents\nacross these three.\n\n00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:19.934\nAnd it's time to start admitting\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:23.934\nyou can't ask the same 19-year-old\nto do it all, day in and day out.\n\n00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.934\nIt's just too damn hard.\n\n00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.958\nWe have an unparalleled\ncapacity to wage war.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.934\nWe don't do the everything else so well.\n\n00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:34.934\nFrankly, we do it better than anybody\nand we still suck at it.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.934\nWe have a brilliant Secretary of War.\n\n00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.934\nWe don't have a Secretary\nof Everything Else.\n\n00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:42.816\nBecause if we did, that guy\nwould be in front of the Senate,\n\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.934\nstill testifying over Abu Ghraib.\n\n00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.934\nThe problem is he doesn't exist.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nThere is no Secretary of Everything Else.\n\n00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.934\nI think we have an unparalleled\ncapacity to wage war.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.934\nI call that the Leviathan Force.\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.934\nWhat we need to build is a force\nfor the Everything Else.\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.934\nI call them the System Administrators.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.934\nWhat I think this really represents\n\n00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.934\nis lack of an A to Z rule set\nfor the world as a whole\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.006\nfor processing politically\nbankrupt states.\n\n00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.934\nWe have one for processing\neconomically bankrupt states.\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.934\nIt's the IMF Sovereign\nBankruptcy Plan, OK?\n\n00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.934\nWe argue about it every time we use it.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:16.934\nArgentina just went through it,\nbroke a lot of rules.\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.149\nThey got out on the far end, we said,\n\"Fine, don't worry about it.\"\n\n00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:22.934\nIt's transparent.

--> 00:10:52.934\nand those who see a future\nthat starts to scare them,\n\n00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:54.934\nlike the U.S. submarine community,\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.339\nwhich watches the

desire\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nand they create their own special language\n\n00:11:06.982 --> 00:11:10.125\nto describe their voyage of self-discovery\nand self-actualization.\n\n00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:12.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.934\nThe problem is you need a big,\nsexy opponent to fight against.\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:17.435\nAnd if you can't find\none you've got to make one up.\n\n00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:19.934\nChina, all grown up, going to be a looker!\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.934\nThe rest of the military got\ndragged down into the muck\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:26.934\nacross the 1990s\n\n00:11:26.958 --> 00:11:29.720\nand they developed this very\nderisive term to describe it:\n\n00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:31.744\nmilitary operations other than war.\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.911\nI ask you, who joins the military\nto do things other than war?\n\n00:11:34.935 --> 00:11:36.934\nActually, most of them.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:39.934\nJessica Lynch never\nplanned on shooting back.\n\n00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:41.958\nMost of them don't pick up a rifle.\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.054\nI maintain this is code\ninside the Army for,\n\n00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:49.078\n\"We don't want to do this.\"\n\n00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:52.054\nThey spent the 1990s\nworking the messy scene\n\n00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.934\nbetween globalized parts of the world\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nWhat I call the core and the gap.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:00.934\nThe Clinton administration wasn't\ninterested in running this.\n\n00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.934\nFor eight years, after screwing\nup the relationship on day one --\n\n00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:05.934\ninauguration day with gays\nin the military --\n\n00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.934\nwhich was deft.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:09.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:11.934\nSo we were home alone for eight years.\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.934\nAnd what did we do home alone?\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.197\nWe bought one military\nand we operated another.\n\n00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:18.602\nIt's like the guy who goes\nto the doctor and says,\n\n00:12:18.626 --> 00:12:20.934\n\"Doctor, it hurts when I do this.\"\n\n00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:23.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.934\nThe doctor says, \"Stop\ndoing that you idiot.\"\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:28.934\nI used to give this brief\ninside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.\n\n00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.934\nI'd say, \"You're buying one military\nand you're operating another,\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.149\nand eventually it's going to hurt.\nIt's wrong.\n\n00:12:33.173 --> 00:12:34.934\nBad Pentagon, bad!\"\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:39.197\nAnd they'd say, \"Dr.\nBarnett, you are so right.\n\n00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:41.555\nCan you come back next year\nand remind us again?\"\n\n00:12:41.579 --> 00:12:46.934\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:48.934\nSome people say 9/11 heals the rift --\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:51.934\njerks the long-term transformation gurus\n\n00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.934\nout of their 30,000 foot view of history,\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:55.934\ndrags them down in to the muck and says,\n\"You want a networked opponent?\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.934\nI've got one, he's everywhere,\ngo find him.\"\n\n00:12:58.958 --> 00:13:01.934\nIt elevates MOOTW --\nhow we pronounce that acronym --\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.934\nfrom crap to grand strategy,\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:06.934\nbecause that's how you're\ngoing to shrink that gap.\n\n00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:07.934\nSome people put these two things together\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nand they call it empire, which I think\nis a boneheaded concept.\n\n00:13:10.982 --> 00:13:13.935\nEmpire is about the enforcement\nof not just minimal rule sets,\n\n00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:14.934\nwhich you cannot do,\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.934\nbut maximum rule sets which you must do.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.934\nIt's not our system of governance.\n\n00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.934\nNever how we've sought to interact\nwith the outside world.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:23.006\nI prefer that phrase\nSystem Administration.\n\n00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.934\nWe enforce the minimal rule sets\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:27.387\nfor maintaining connectivity\nto the global economy.\n\n00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:29.411\nCertain bad things you cannot do.\n\n00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:33.934\nHow this impacts the way we think\nabout the future of war.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:37.054\nThis is a concept which gets me\nvilified throughout the Pentagon.\n\n00:13:37.078 --> 00:13:38.934\nIt makes me very popular as well.\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:40.934\nEverybody's got an opinion.\n\n00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:43.101\nGoing back to the beginning\nof our country --\n\n00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:46.125\nhistorically, defenses meant\nprotection of the homeland.\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.934\nSecurity has meant everything else.\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:51.934\nWritten into our constitution,\n\n00:13:51.958 --> 00:13:54.934\ntwo different forces,\ntwo different functions.\n\n00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.934\nRaise an army when you need it,\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:01.934\nand maintain a navy\nfor day-to-day connectivity.\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.934\nA Department of War,\na Department of Everything Else.\n\n00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.958\nA big stick, a baton stick.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:11.958\nCan of whup ass,\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.934\nthe networking force.\n\n00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.006\nIn 1947 we merged these\ntwo things together\n\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.934\nin the Defense Department.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.934\nOur long-term rationale becomes,\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.934\nwe're involved in a hair trigger\nstand off with the Soviets.\n\n00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.934\nTo attack America is to risk\nblowing up the

global security to make\nthe world a lot more comfortable,\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:54.934\nand to embed and contextualize\nour employment\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nof force around the

00:15:52.471\nI knew we'd kick ass in the war\nwith the Leviathan Force.\n\n00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:54.780\nI knew we'd have a hard\ntime with what followed.\n\n00:15:54.804 --> 00:15:58.281\nBut I know this organization doesn't\nchange until it experiences failure.\n\n00:15:58.804 --> 00:16:00.947\nWhat do I mean by these\ntwo different forces?\n\n00:16:01.804 --> 00:16:03.780\nThis is the

I don't\nwant to see it go.\n\n00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:07.780\nThat plus nukes rules out great power war.\n\n00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:09.780\nThis is the military the rest\nof the world wants us to build.\n\n00:16:09.804 --> 00:16:12.995\nIt's why I travel all over the world\ntalking to foreign militaries.\n\n00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:15.780\nWhat does this mean?\n\n00:16:15.804 --> 00:16:17.780\nIt means you've got to stop pretending\n\n00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:21.281\nyou can do these two very disparate\nskill sets with the same 19-year-old.\n\n00:16:21.305 --> 00:16:23.780\nSwitching back, morning,\nafternoon, evening,\n\n00:16:23.804 --> 00:16:25.780\nmorning, afternoon, evening.\n\n00:16:25.804 --> 00:16:27.780\nHanding out aid, shooting back,\n\n00:16:27.804 --> 00:16:29.780\nhanding out aid, shooting back.\n\n00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:31.780\nIt's too much.\n\n00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:34.780\nThe 19-year-olds get tired\nfrom the switching, OK?\n\n00:16:34.804 --> 00:16:36.780\n(Laughter)\n\n00:16:36.804 --> 00:16:39.804\nThat force on the left, you can\ntrain a 19-year-old to do that.\n\n00:16:39.828 --> 00:16:42.780\nThat force on the right is more\nlike a 40-year-old cop.\n\n00:16:42.804 --> 00:16:44.804\nYou need the experience.\n\n00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.852\nWhat does this mean\nin terms of operations?\n\n00:16:49.804 --> 00:16:51.804\nThe rule is going to be this.\n\n00:16:52.804 --> 00:16:55.780\nThat Sys Admin force is the force\nthat never comes home,\n\n00:16:55.804 --> 00:16:57.780\ndoes most of your work.\n\n00:16:57.804 --> 00:17:00.780\nYou break out that Leviathan\nForce only every so often.\n\n00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:02.780\nBut here's the promise you\nmake to the American public,\n\n00:17:02.804 --> 00:17:04.780\nto your own people, to the world.\n\n00:17:04.804 --> 00:17:06.780\nYou break out that Leviathan Force,\n\n00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:09.780\nyou promise, you guarantee\nthat you're going to mount\n\n00:17:09.804 --> 00:17:13.780\none hell of a -- immediately\n-- follow-on Sys Admin effort.\n\n00:17:13.804 --> 00:17:16.471\nDon't plan for the war unless you\nplan to win the peace.\n\n00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:21.780\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:21.804 --> 00:17:23.780\nOther differences.

that.\n\n00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:47.780\nWhat we need to do\nis inter-agency operations,\n\n00:17:47.804 --> 00:17:49.804\nwhich frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.\n\n00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:53.114\nAnd I'm amazed nobody asked her\nthat question when she was confirmed.\n\n00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:55.780\nI call the Leviathan Force\nyour dad's military.\n\n00:17:55.804 -->

that.\n\n00:18:47.804 --> 00:18:49.780\nDo we need a bigger budget?\n\n00:18:49.804 --> 00:18:52.780\nDo we need a draft to pull this off?\n\n00:18:52.804 --> 00:18:54.804\nAbsolutely

00:19:11.780\nYou're going to build the Sys Admin\nForce inside the U.S. Military first.\n\n00:19:11.804 --> 00:19:15.780\nBut ultimately you're going\nto civilianize it, probably two thirds.\n\n00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:19.780\nInter agency-ize it, internationalize it.\n\n00:19:19.804 --> 00:19:21.780\nSo yes, it begins inside the Pentagon,\n\n00:19:21.804 --> 00:19:24.780\nbut over

00:20:16.780\nIt keeps it from being the U.N.\n\n00:20:16.804 --> 00:20:18.780\nYou shoot at these people the Marines\nare going to come over and kill you.\n\n00:20:18.804 -->

What does this all mean for us? What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again. It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world. With graphics, computing power, low latencies, these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives. So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives, are all about extending our current search metaphor.When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web, remembering URLs, saving favorites. As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings, the Web matching, the index crawling. But we want to use our brain! We want to navigate, explore, discover information. In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat. We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day? Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life? So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world. What we want to do is mix in all types of data. Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge. So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin? Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people. This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.Here is an example of our aerial camera. This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones. In addition, it's multi-spectral. We collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down. That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity. We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air. You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints, vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.We sit here \u2014 you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale \u2014 what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience. I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials, kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity. So a little unknown secret is \u2014 did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam? The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him. Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team. (Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here. But let me tell you \u2014 it doesn't affect his day job.We think a lot of good can come from this technology. This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone. We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue. Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth. We made it all freely available on the Web, just to \u2014 it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.When we think about how all this comes together, it's all about software, algorithms and math. You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images. We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points. Extract geometry from the images. This process is a very calculated process. In fact, it was always done manual. Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually. They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR. They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building. We do this all through software, algorithms and math \u2014 a highly automated pipeline creating these cities. We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities, and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.We think about the user interface. What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives? An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model? I'll wrap up by showing you the \u2014 this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth. What we're doing is \u2014 people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data. But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model. A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space. You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over. I can get the next image. I can blend and transition. By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history. The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image. I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.What we're trying to do is build a virtual world. We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with, and really derive insights from you, from all different directions. I thank you very much for your time.

I told you that the statistics of the world have not been made properly available. Because of that, we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong. And that animated graphics can make a difference. Things are changing and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page, it says, by first of May, full access to the databases. (Applause) And if I could share the image with you on the screen. So three things have happened. U.N. opened their statistic databases, and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net, so you don't have to download it any longer.And let me repeat what you saw last year. The bubbles are the countries. Here you have the fertility rate \u2014 the number of children per woman \u2014 and there you have the length of life in years. This is 1950 \u2014 those were the industrialized countries, those were developing countries. At that time there was a \"we\" and \"them.\" There was a huge difference in the world. But then it changed, and it went on quite well.And this is what happens. You can see how China is the red, big bubble. The blue there is India. And they go over all this \u2014 I'm going to try to be a little more serious this year in showing you how things really changed. And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it? Large families still, and the HIV epidemic brought down the countries like this. This is more or less what we saw last year, and this is how it will go on into the future.And I will talk on, is this possible? Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist. Because this is where we are. Will it be possible that this will happen? I cover my lifetime here, you know? I expect to live 100 years. And this is where we are today. Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world? And I would like to show that against child survival. We'll swap the axis. Here you have child mortality \u2014 that is, survival \u2014 four kids dying there, 200 dying there. And this is GDP per capita on this axis. And this was 2007.And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics \u2014 here we go, here we go, here we go \u2014 not so much statistics 100 years ago. Some countries still had statistics. We are looking down in the archive, and when we are down into 1820, there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers. (Laughter) But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year. And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world. How they got slowly richer and richer, and they add statistics. Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics? You see the importance of that? And here, children don't live longer. The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe, because most of this statistics is Europe. It was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year. This is India coming up, with the first data from India. And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money. And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here. And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health, not getting so rich. There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money. It moves this way over here. And the bubbles keep moving up there, and this is what the world looks like today. (Applause)Let us have a look at the United States. We have a function here \u2014 I can tell the world, \"Stay where you are.\" And I take the United States \u2014 we still want to see the background \u2014 I put them up like this, and now we go backwards. And we can see that the United States goes to the right of the mainstream. They are on the money side all the time. And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India \u2014 present, contemporary India. And that means United States was richer, but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally. And look here \u2014 compare to the Philippines of today. The Philippines of today has almost the same economy as the United States during the First World War. But we have to bring United States forward quite a while to find the same health of the United States as we have in the Philippines. About 1957 here, the health of the United States is the same as the Philippines. And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized, is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America, are much more ahead in being healthy, educated, having human resources than they are economically.There's a discrepancy in what's happening today in the emerging economies. There now, social benefits, social progress, are going ahead of economical progress. And 1957 \u2014 the United States had the same economy as Chile has today. And how long do we have to bring United States to get the same health as Chile has today? I think we have to go, there \u2014 we have 2001, or 2002 \u2014 the United States has the same health as Chile. Chile's catching up! Within some years Chile may have better child survival than the United States. This is really a change, that you have this lag of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.And behind the health is the educational level. And there's a lot of infrastructure things, and general human resources are there. Now we can take away this \u2014 and I would like to show you the rate of speed, the rate of change, how fast they have gone. And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan. And I want to look at Sweden and the United States. And I'm going to stage a race here between this sort of yellowish Ford here and the red Toyota down there, and the brownish Volvo. (Laughter) And here we go. Here we go. The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see, and the United States Ford is going off-road there. And the Volvo is doing quite fine. This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden \u2014 can you see that? And they are taking over Sweden, and they are now healthier than Sweden. That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota. (Laughter) And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan. They really caught up.And this changes gradually. We have to look over generations to understand it. And let me show you my own sort of family history \u2014 we made these graphs here. And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know? And this is my family. This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born. Sweden was like Sierra Leone today. And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863. And Sweden was like Mozambique. And this is when my grandma was born, 1891. She took care of me as a child, so I'm not talking about statistic now \u2014 now it's oral history in my family. That's when I believe statistics, when it's grandma-verified statistics. (Laughter) I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics. Sweden was like Ghana. It's interesting to see the enormous diversity within sub-Saharan Africa. I told you last year, I'll tell you again, my mother was born in Egypt, and I \u2014 who am I? I'm the Mexican in the family. And my daughter, she was born in Chile, and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore, now the healthiest country on this Earth. It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago, with better child survival. But they're very small, you know? They're so close to the hospital we can never beat them out in these forests. (Laughter) But homage to Singapore.Singapore is the best one. Now this looks also like a very good story. But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story. Because I have to show you one of the other facilities. We can also make the color here represent the variable \u2014 and what am I choosing here? Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita. This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person. And China was emitting 0.6, and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita. And what happens when we moved on? Well, you see the nice story of getting richer and getting healthier \u2014 everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide. There is no one who has done it so far. And we don't have all the updated data any longer, because this is really hot data today. And there we are, 2001.And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know, many say now the problem is that the emerging economies, they are getting out too much carbon dioxide. The Minister of the Environment of India said, \"Well, you were the one who caused the problem.\" The OECD countries \u2014 the high-income countries \u2014 they were the ones who caused the climate change. \"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it. But from now on, we count per capita. From now on we count per capita. And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.\"This really shows you, we have not seen good economic and health progress anywhere in the world without destroying the climate. And this is really what has to be changed. I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world, but I don't think it's like this. The world is quite a messy place. This we can call Dollar Street. Everyone lives on this street here. What they earn here \u2014 what number they live on \u2014 is how much they earn per day. This family earns about one dollar per day. We drive up the street here, we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day. And we drive away here \u2014 we find the first garden in the street, and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.And how do they live? If we look at the bed here, we can see that they sleep on a rug on the floor. This is what poverty line is \u2014 80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs, the food for the day. This is two to five dollars. You have a bed. And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see. I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see the sofa immediately here. (Laughter) And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there. And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama, you see the family still sitting on the floor there. Although there is a sofa, if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars. It comes beyond here, when you really can get good working conditions in the family. And if you really want to see the difference, you look at the toilet over here. This can change. This can change. These are all pictures and images from Africa, and it can become much better. We can get out of poverty.My own research has not been in IT or anything like this. I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers who were on the verge of famine. And this is the result of the farmers-needs research. The nice thing here is that you can't see who are the researchers in this picture. That's when research functions in poor societies \u2014 you must really live with the people.When you're in poverty, everything is about survival. It's about having food. And these two young farmers, they are girls now \u2014 because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS \u2014 they discuss with a trained agronomist. This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira, and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant \u2014 the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found. And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice, and that's to survive in poverty. That's one context. Getting out of poverty. The women told us one thing. \"Get us technology. We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours. Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour, then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.\" Technology will bring you out of poverty, but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty. And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market. But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market. She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market and doesn't have to stay home. And she wants the infrastructure \u2014 it is nice with a paved road. It's also good with credit. Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know. And information will tell her when to go to market with which product. You can do this.I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that the seemingly impossible is possible. Africa has not done bad. In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe, with a functioning nation and state. I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years. Because we don't consider where they came from. It's this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago, and says that Mozambique did worse. We have to know a little more about the world. I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine. He knows everything. He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything. I only know two types of wine \u2014 red and white. (Laughter) But my neighbor only knows two types of countries \u2014 industrialized and developing. And I know 200, I know about the small data. But you can do that. (Applause)But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious? You make a PowerPoint, you know? (Laughter) Homage to the Office package, no? What is this, what is this, what am I telling? I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development. Everyone wants your pet thing. If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit. If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization, you love equity between gender. Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on. On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing. We need everything. All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare.Now, what we need to think about is, what is a goal for development, and what are the means for development? Let me first grade what are the most important means. Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor, is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival. Governance. To have a government which functions \u2014 that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850. It was the government that made law function finally. Education, human resources are important. Health is also important, but not that much as a mean. Environment is important. Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.Now what about goals? Where are we going toward? We are not interested in money. Money is not a goal. It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal. Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing, but it's not a goal. And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean. Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy \u2014 at my age especially \u2014 you can stand here, you're healthy. And that's good, it gets two plusses. Environment is very, very crucial. There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up. But where are the important goals? Of course, it's human rights. Human rights is the goal, but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development. And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say, because that's what brings joy to life. That's the value of living.So the seemingly impossible is possible. Even African countries can achieve this. And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible. And remember, please remember my main message, which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible. We can have a good world. I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint, and I think I will convince you also by culture. (Laughter) (Applause) Bring me my sword! Sword swallowing is from ancient India. It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious. (Laughter) And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel \u2014 solid steel \u2014 this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850, in the last year we had war. And it's all solid steel \u2014 you can hear here. And I'm going to take this blade of steel, and push it down through my body of blood and flesh, and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible. Can I request a moment of absolute silence?

They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.\n\n00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nAnd they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.958\nSo this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.\n\n00:03:15.958 --> 00:03:18.958\nHow they got slowly richer and richer,\n\n00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nand they add statistics.\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nIsn't it beautiful when they get statistics?\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.958\nYou see the importance of that?\n\n00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nAnd here, children don't live longer.\n\n00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.958\nThe last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nbecause most of this statistics is Europe.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:34.958\nIt was only by the turn of the century\n\n00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nthat more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:40.958\nThis is India coming up, with the first data from India.\n\n00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.958\nAnd this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.\n\n00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.958\nAnd we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.\n\n00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nAnd it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nnot getting so rich.\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.958\nThere he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.\n\n00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:57.958\nIt moves this way over here.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.958\nAnd the bubbles keep moving up there,\n\n00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nand this is what the world looks like today.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:08.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nLet us have a look at the United States.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nWe have a function here -- I can tell the world, \"Stay where you are.\"\n\n00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.958\nAnd I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --\n\n00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.958\nI put them up like this, and now we go backwards.\n\n00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.958\nAnd we can see that the United States\n\n00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.958\ngoes to the right of the mainstream.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nThey are on the money side all the time.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:35.958\nAnd down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --\n\n00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.958\npresent, contemporary India.\n\n00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:40.958\nAnd that means United States was richer,\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nbut lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.\n\n00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.958\nAnd look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.958\nThe Philippines of today has almost the same economy\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:54.958\nas the United States during the First World War.\n\n00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.958\nBut we have to bring United States forward quite a while\n\n00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:01.958\nto find the same health of the United States\n\n00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:02.958\nas we have in the Philippines.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.958\nAbout 1957 here, the health of the United States\n\n00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:08.958\nis the same as the Philippines.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nAnd this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nis that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nare much more ahead in being healthy, educated,\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nhaving human resources than they are economically.\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nThere's a discrepancy in what's happening today\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nin the emerging economies.\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nThere now, social benefits, social progress,\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nare going ahead of economical progress.\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:39.958\nAnd 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.\n\n00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nAnd how long do we have to bring United States\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nto get the same health as Chile has today?\n\n00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nI think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nthe United States has the same health as Chile.\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:54.958\nChile's catching up!\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:57.958\nWithin some years Chile may have better child survival\n\n00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.958\nthan the United States.\n\n00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.958\nThis is really a change, that you have this lag\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nof more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.\n\n00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:09.958\nAnd behind the health is the educational level.\n\n00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958\nAnd there's a lot of infrastructure things,\n\n00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:14.958\nand general human resources are there.\n\n00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.958\nNow we can take away this --\n\n00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:21.958\nand I would like to show you the rate of speed,\n\n00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nthe rate of change, how fast they have gone.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.\n\n00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nAnd I want to look at Sweden and the United States.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nAnd I'm going to stage a race here\n\n00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nbetween this sort of yellowish Ford here\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:42.958\nand the red Toyota down there,\n\n00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:44.958\nand the brownish Volvo.\n\n00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:46.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nAnd here we go. Here we go.\n\n00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:51.958\nThe Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,\n\n00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.958\nand the United States Ford is going off-road there.\n\n00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.958\nAnd the Volvo is doing quite fine.\n\n00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nThis is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nthe Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:01.958\ncan you see that?\n\n00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:02.958\nAnd they are taking over Sweden,\n\n00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:04.958\nand they are now healthier than Sweden.\n\n00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:06.958\nThat's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:09.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:13.958\nAnd now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.\n\n00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.958\nThey really caught up.\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nAnd this changes gradually.\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.958\nWe have to look over generations to understand it.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nAnd let me show you my own sort of family history --\n\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nwe made these graphs here.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:31.958\nAnd this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:33.958\nAnd this is my family.\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:38.958\nThis is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.958\nSweden was like Sierra Leone today.\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.958\nAnd this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd Sweden was like Mozambique.\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd this is when my grandma was born, 1891.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:52.958\nShe took care of me as a child,\n\n00:07:52.958 --> 00:07:54.958\nso I'm not talking about statistic now --\n\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.958\nnow it's oral history in my family.\n\n00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:58.958\nThat's when I believe statistics,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nwhen it's grandma-verified statistics.\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:04.958 --> 00:08:07.958\nI think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.\n\n00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nSweden was like Ghana.\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:11.958\nIt's interesting to see the enormous diversity\n\n00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nwithin sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nI told you last year, I'll tell you again,\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:19.958\nmy mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?\n\n00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nI'm the Mexican in the family.\n\n00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.958\nAnd my daughter, she was born in Chile,\n\n00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.958\nand the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,\n\n00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:27.958\nnow the healthiest country on this Earth.\n\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.958\nIt bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,\n\n00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.958\nwith better child survival.\n\n00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:32.958\nBut they're very small, you know?\n\n00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nThey're so close to the hospital we can never\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nbeat them out in these forests.\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nBut homage to Singapore.\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nSingapore is the best one.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nNow this looks also like a very good story.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:49.958\nBut it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.\n\n00:08:49.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nBecause I have to show you one of the other facilities.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nWe can also make the color here represent the variable --\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nand what am I choosing here?\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nCarbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nThis is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:10.958\nAnd China was emitting 0.6,\n\n00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nand India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.958\nAnd what happens when we moved on?\n\n00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.958\nWell, you see the nice story of getting richer\n\n00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:20.958\nand getting healthier --\n\n00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.958\neveryone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.\n\n00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:28.958\nThere is no one who has done it so far.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nAnd we don't have all the updated data\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nany longer, because this is really hot data today.\n\n00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd there we are, 2001.\n\n00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:41.958\nAnd in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,\n\n00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.958\nmany say now the problem is that the emerging economies,\n\n00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:48.958\nthey are getting out too much carbon dioxide.\n\n00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:50.958\nThe Minister of the Environment of India said,\n\n00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.958\n\"Well, you were the one who caused the problem.\"\n\n00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.958\nThe OECD countries -- the high-income countries --\n\n00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.958\nthey were the ones who caused the climate change.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.958\n\"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.\n\n00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:04.958\nBut from now on, we count per capita.\n\n00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nFrom now on we count per capita.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:09.958\nAnd everyone is responsible for the per capita emission.\"\n\n00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:12.958\nThis really shows you, we have not seen good economic\n\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:14.958\nand health progress anywhere in the world\n\n00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nwithout destroying the climate.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.958\nAnd this is really what has to be changed.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nI've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.958\nbut I don't think it's like this.\n\n00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.958\nThe world is quite a messy place.\n\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:31.958\nThis we can call Dollar Street.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:33.958\nEveryone lives on this street here.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:36.958\nWhat they earn here -- what number they live on --\n\n00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nis how much they earn per day.\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:40.958\nThis family earns about one dollar per day.\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:42.958\nWe drive up the street here,\n\n00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nwe find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.\n\n00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nAnd we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:51.958\nand they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.\n\n00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nAnd how do they live?\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:56.958\nIf we look at the bed here, we can see\n\n00:10:56.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nthat they sleep on a rug on the floor.\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nThis is what poverty line is --\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.958\n80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthe food for the day.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nThis is two to five dollars. You have a bed.\n\n00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:11.958\nAnd here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.958\nI lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see\n\n00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.958\nthe sofa immediately here.\n\n00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:22.958\nAnd this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.\n\n00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nAnd the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:27.958\nyou see the family still sitting on the floor there.\n\n00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.958\nAlthough there is a sofa,\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.958\nif you watch in the kitchen, you can see that\n\n00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nthe great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.\n\n00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:38.958\nIt comes beyond here, when you really can get\n\n00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.958\ngood working conditions in the family.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:43.958\nAnd if you really want to see the difference,\n\n00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nyou look at the toilet over here.\n\n00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThis can change. This can change.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nThese are all pictures and images from Africa,\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nand it can become much better.\n\n00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nWe can get out of poverty.\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.958\nMy own research has not been in IT or anything like this.\n\n00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nI spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:04.958\nwho were on the verge of famine.\n\n00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.958\nAnd this is the result of the farmers-needs research.\n\n00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:08.958\nThe nice thing here is that you can't see\n\n00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nwho are the researchers in this picture.\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nThat's when research functions in poor societies --\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nyou must really live with the people.\n\n00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nWhen you're in poverty, everything is about survival.\n\n00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.958\nIt's about having food.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnd these two young farmers, they are girls now --\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:29.958\nbecause the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --\n\n00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.958\nthey discuss with a trained agronomist.\n\n00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:35.958\nThis is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:37.958\nand he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nthe best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:44.958\nAnd they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,\n\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.958\nand that's to survive in poverty.\n\n00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:48.958\nThat's one context.\n\n00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nGetting out of poverty.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.958\nThe women told us one thing. \"Get us technology.\n\n00:12:53.958 --> 00:12:56.958\nWe hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.\n\n00:12:56.958 --> 00:12:59.958\nGet us a mill so that we can mill our flour,\n\n00:12:59.958 --> 00:13:02.958\nthen we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.\"\n\n00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nTechnology will bring you out of poverty,\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:09.958\nbut there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.\n\n00:13:09.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nAnd this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nBut she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.958\nso she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.\n\n00:13:17.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nShe wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nand doesn't have to stay home.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:25.958\nAnd she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.\n\n00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:27.958\nIt's also good with credit.\n\n00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nMicro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:33.958\nAnd information will tell her when to go to market with which product.\n\n00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nYou can do this.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nI find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:41.958\nthe seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:43.958\nAfrica has not done bad.\n\n00:13:43.958 --> 00:13:46.958\nIn 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:49.958\nto a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,\n\n00:13:49.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nwith a functioning nation and state.\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nI would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:56.958\nduring the last 50 years.\n\n00:13:56.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nBecause we don't consider where they came from.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:01.958\nIt's this stupid concept of developing countries\n\n00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:04.958\nthat puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,\n\n00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nand says that Mozambique did worse.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.958\nWe have to know a little more about the world.\n\n00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nI have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nHe knows everything.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:15.958\nHe knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.\n\n00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nI only know two types of wine -- red and white.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nBut my neighbor only knows two types of countries --\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nindustrialized and developing.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.958\nAnd I know 200, I know about the small data.\n\n00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nBut you can do that.\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:33.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nBut I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nYou make a PowerPoint, you know?\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:42.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:44.958\nHomage to the Office package, no?\n\n00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nWhat is this, what is this, what am I telling?\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:51.958\nI'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.\n\n00:14:51.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nEveryone wants your pet thing.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nIf you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nIf you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:01.958\nyou love equity between gender.\n\n00:15:01.958 --> 00:15:03.958\nOr if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.\n\n00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.958\nOn the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:07.958\nWe need everything.\n\n00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:09.958\nAll these things are important for development,\n\n00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:11.958\nespecially when you just get out of poverty\n\n00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:14.958\nand you should go towards welfare.\n\n00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:16.958\nNow, what we need to think about\n\n00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:19.958\nis, what is a goal for development,\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:20.958\nand what are the means for development?\n\n00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:23.958\nLet me first grade what are the most important means.\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nEconomic growth to me, as a public-health professor,\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nis the most important thing for development\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nbecause it explains 80 percent of survival.\n\n00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nGovernance. To have a government which functions --\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:40.958\nthat's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.\n\n00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nIt was the government that made law function finally.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nEducation, human resources are important.\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:50.958\nHealth is also important, but not that much as a mean.\n\n00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nEnvironment is important.\n\n00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:54.958\nHuman rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.\n\n00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.958\nNow what about goals? Where are we going toward?\n\n00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.958\nWe are not interested in money.\n\n00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:00.958\nMoney is not a goal.\n\n00:16:00.958 --> 00:16:03.958\nIt's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.\n\n00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:07.958\nGovernance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,\n\n00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:09.958\nbut it's not a goal.\n\n00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.958\nAnd going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.\n\n00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.958\nHealth I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy\n\n00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.958\n-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.\n\n00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:19.958\nAnd that's good, it gets two plusses.\n\n00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nEnvironment is very, very crucial.\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nThere's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:25.958\nBut where are the important goals?\n\n00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nOf course, it's human rights.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:29.958\nHuman rights is the goal,\n\n00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nbut it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.\n\n00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.958\nAnd culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nbecause that's what brings joy to life.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.958\nThat's the value of living.\n\n00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.958\nSo the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.958\nEven African countries can achieve this.\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:53.958\nAnd I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:16:53.958 --> 00:16:57.958\nAnd remember, please remember my main message,\n\n00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nwhich is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:02.958\nWe can have a good world.\n\n00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:05.958\nI showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,\n\n00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:11.958\nand I think I will convince you also by culture.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:16.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:17:16.958 --> 00:17:18.958\nBring me my sword!\n\n00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.958\nSword swallowing is from ancient India.\n\n00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:32.958\nIt's a cultural expression that for thousands of years\n\n00:17:32.958 --> 00:17:38.958\nhas inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.\n\n00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:40.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:17:40.958 --> 00:17:45.958\nAnd I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible\n\n00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:48.958\nby taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --\n\n00:17:49.958 --> 00:17:52.958\nthis is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,\n\n00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.958\nin the last year we had war.\n\n00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.958\nAnd it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.\n\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:04.958\nAnd I'm going to take this blade of steel,\n\n00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:09.958\nand push it down through my body of blood and flesh,\n\n00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:13.958\nand prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.\n\n00:18:14.958 --> 00:18:18.958\nCan I request a moment of absolute silence?\n\n00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:51.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "I'm going to the moon. Who's with me?", "duration": "1063", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_stone_explores_the_earth_and_space", "transcript": "First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss. And I say believe because this process is still ongoing. Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about.One of the things that's changed here, in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like, is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months, with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.And a lot of people ask me, you know, what kind of people do you get for a project like this? While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough. We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength. In case you're wondering, this is our strength test. (Laughter) But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations.We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance. From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave. You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2. We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point. And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse, except that you're now running a string of these things down. The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places. I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way, is artificially illuminated at great effort. Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water. It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down. And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s. So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico. (Video) Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous. We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. (Laughter)Along that same line, I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year, we have never seen monsters underground \u2014 at least the kind that eat you. If there is a monster underground, it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2. We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters \u2014 that's a little over 8,600 feet down \u2014 at 30 kilometers from the entrance. The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight. I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.Eventually, if you keep going down in these things, probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof. And when you used to find these things, they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon. Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second, is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle. And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater. When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space, but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril. So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range, away from a safe haven.Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in 1999.(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before. This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet. To experience it is a privilege.Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida. Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999. It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects. This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper, and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world.This is Europa. Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day. This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. For those who have never seen this story, Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago, called \"Aliens of the Deep.\" There was a brief clip \u2014(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge. Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. Now we have to get through the ice. You need a melt probe. It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo. The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep. Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice, until finally \u2014 Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean? You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle. It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX \u2014 Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy. It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers, 100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code, packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.This is the target site, the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico. It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters and beyond that nobody knows anything. This is part of DEPTHX's mission.There are two primary targets we're doing here. One is, how do you do science autonomy underground? How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist? There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables \u2014 sulphide, halide, things like that. We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life. We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations, looking for changes in color. If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope. If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection. We either draw in a liquid sample, or we can actually take a solid core from the wall. No hands at the wheel. This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own.The real hat trick for this vehicle, though, is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed, known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping. DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball. Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time, allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock on what it's gone through already.What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton, and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria. The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then, if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go, we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.What then of manned space exploration? The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024. The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots. It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago. Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas. And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. There are three underpinnings of working in space privately. One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport. The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. Go, go, go.The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on. The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this: a gas station on orbit. It's not going to look like that. If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.Now, to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement, I've got to give you the basics of Space 101. And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. Anybody drink one of these here this week? You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit. That's more than you pay for TED, if Google dropped their sponsorship. (Laughter) The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space, you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator. Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price? There is a place where you can. In fact, you can get it better \u2014 you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. There is a little-known mission that was launched by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine. And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material.If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible, we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. We can't do that right now. The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground, and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces. We have to beat that. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989, with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. And we can extend that now to just about everything. Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit. We can go much further. We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. There's another thing. When you're coming back from the moon, you have to deal with orbital mechanics. It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.You got two choices. You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible. You can dive into the stratosphere, and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station. It has never been done. It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride \u2014 better than Disney. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. If you try to do that for the moon, you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. But if you send a mining team there, without the return propellant, first \u2014 (Laughter) Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez? This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty. I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it, and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years. That's not true. In seven years, we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space. The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed. We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater, to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing. I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED. I intend to lead that expedition. (Applause) It can be done in seven years with the right backing. Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. We have collectively forgotten that lesson. Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward. 100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words, I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us. Thank you.

down.\n\n00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nThe idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:12.958\nwhile you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.\n\n00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.958\nI should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,\n\n00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:18.958\nis artificially illuminated at great effort.\n\n00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:20.958\nOtherwise it is completely dark in these places.\n\n00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:25.958\nThe deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.\n\n00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.958\nIt's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.\n\n00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nAnd eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous\n\n00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:36.958\nand unfortunately slides just don't do justice.\n\n00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.958\nSo I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.\n\n00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.958\nSo descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:48.958\n(Video)\n\n00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.958\nNow I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.958\nare obsolete and dangerous.\n\n00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nWe would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.\n\n00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.958\nAlong that same line, I have to tell you\n\n00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.958\nthat with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,\n\n00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.958\nwe have never seen monsters underground --\n\n00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.958\nat least the kind that eat you.\n\n00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:16.958\nIf there is a monster underground,\n\n00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:19.958\nit is the crushing psychological remoteness\n\n00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.958\nthat begins to hit every member of the team\n\n00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.958\nonce you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.\n\n00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.958\nNext year I'll be leading an international team to J2.\n\n00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.958\nWe're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --\n\n00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nthat's a little over 8,600 feet down --\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\nat 30 kilometers from the entrance.\n\n00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThe lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:43.958\nI don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.958\nEventually, if you keep going down in these things,\n\n00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.958\nprobability says that you're going to run into a place like this.\n\n00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:53.958\nIt's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum\n\n00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nthat collects water and fills to the roof.\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nAnd when you used to find these things,\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:01.958\nthey would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.\n\n00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.958\nNow I remember that term really well for two reasons.\n\n00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.958\nNumber one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,\n\n00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nis because the confrontation of these things\n\n00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:11.958\nforced me to become an inventor.\n\n00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nAnd we've since gone on to develop\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nmany generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.\n\n00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nAnd you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:26.958\nunderwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:30.958\nWhen you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.\n\n00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.958\nIt's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,\n\n00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.958\nbut at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.\n\n00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:39.958\nSo it makes you think about how to design your equipment\n\n00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:41.958\nfor long range, away from a safe haven.\n\n00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.958\nHere's a clip from a National Geographic movie\n\n00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:46.958\nthat came out in 1999.\n\n00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.958\n(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process\n\n00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:52.958\nof putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.\n\n00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nThis is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.958\nTo experience it is a privilege.\n\n00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:07.958\nBill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.\n\n00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.958\nCouple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment\n\n00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.958\nthat you saw in there did not exist before 1999.\n\n00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:19.958\nIt was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.\n\n00:05:19.958 --> 00:05:22.958\nThis gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,\n\n00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.958\nand it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done\n\n00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.958\nof a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.\n\n00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.958\nIt was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door\n\n00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nto another unexplored world.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:38.958\nThis is Europa.\n\n00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.958\nCarolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.\n\n00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.958\nThis is one of the places where planetary scientists\n\n00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nbelieve there is a highest probability of the detection\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:51.958\nof the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.\n\n00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.958\nFor those who have never seen this story,\n\n00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.958\nJim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie\n\n00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:58.958\ncouple of years ago, called \"Aliens of the Deep.\"\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:00.958\nThere was a brief clip --\n\n00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.958\n(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa\n\n00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:07.958\nwould be the ultimate robotic challenge.\n\n00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:16.958\nEuropa is so far away that even at the speed of light,\n\n00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.958\nit would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.\n\n00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.958\nIt has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards\n\n00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:25.958\nand to find a good landing site on the ice.\n\n00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.958\nNow we have to get through the ice.\n\n00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.958\nYou need a melt probe.\n\n00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.958\nIt's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.958\nThe ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nWeek after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nthrough the ancient ice, until finally --\n\n00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.958\nNow, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?\n\n00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:19.958\nYou need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.\n\n00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:22.958\nIt needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate\n\n00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.958\nand make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie\n\n00:07:29.958 --> 00:07:34.958\nwas that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled\n\n00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:37.958\nto develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.\n\n00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:42.958\nI mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design\n\n00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nand system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --\n\n00:07:45.958 --> 00:07:47.958\nDeep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.\n\n00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.958\nAnd as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.\n\n00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nIt's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:58.958\n100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,\n\n00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:03.958\npacks more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.\n\n00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nThis is the target site,\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:10.958\nthe world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.\n\n00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.958\nIt's been explored to a depth of 292 meters\n\n00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:15.958\nand beyond that nobody knows anything.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.958\nThis is part of DEPTHX's mission.\n\n00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:20.958\nThere are two primary targets we're doing here.\n\n00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nOne is, how do you do science autonomy underground?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.958\nHow do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?\n\n00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThere are more stages involved here\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nthan I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:34.958\nthrough the space, we populate it with environmental variables --\n\n00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:36.958\nsulphide, halide, things like that.\n\n00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nWe calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.958\nwhere there's a high probability of life.\n\n00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:43.958\nWe move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,\n\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.958\nlooking for changes in color.\n\n00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.958\nIf we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.\n\n00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.958\nIf it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.\n\n00:08:52.958 --> 00:08:54.958\nWe either draw in a liquid sample,\n\n00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:57.958\nor we can actually take a solid core from the wall.\n\n00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:58.958\nNo hands at the wheel.\n\n00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:00.958\nThis is all behavioral autonomy here\n\n00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nthat's being conducted by the robot on its own.\n\n00:09:03.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nThe real hat trick for this vehicle, though,\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:08.958\nis a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,\n\n00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.958\nknown as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.\n\n00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.958\nDEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.\n\n00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:18.958\nIts sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,\n\n00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.958\nallowing it to do new exploration\n\n00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nwhile it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:24.958\non what it's gone through already.\n\n00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.958\nWhat I'm going to show you next\n\n00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nis the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:34.958\nthat's ever been done.\n\n00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThis May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,\n\n00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nand if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.958\nrobotically-discovered division of bacteria.\n\n00:10:31.958 --> 00:10:34.958\nThe next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,\n\n00:10:34.958 --> 00:10:37.958\nif the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,\n\n00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:41.958\nwe could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019\n\n00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.958\nwe may have the first evidence of life off this planet.\n\n00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.958\nWhat then of manned space exploration?\n\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nThe government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.\n\n00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:57.958\nThe successful conclusion of that mission will result\n\n00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:01.958\nin infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number\n\n00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.958\nof government scientists and pilots.\n\n00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:07.958\nIt will leave us no further along in the general expansion\n\n00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.958\nof humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.\n\n00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958\nSomething fundamental has to change\n\n00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nif we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nWhat I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.\n\n00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nAnd I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.958\nthat there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.\n\n00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:32.958\nThere are three underpinnings of working in space privately.\n\n00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nOne of them is the requirement\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.958\nfor economical earth-to-space transport.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nThe Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world\n\n00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:42.958\nhave got this in their sights and I salute them.\n\n00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:44.958\nGo, go, go.\n\n00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.958\nThe next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.\n\n00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nOrbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:56.958\nThe final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:\n\n00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:58.958\na gas station on orbit.\n\n00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.958\nIt's not going to look like that.\n\n00:12:01.958 --> 00:12:07.958\nIf it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.\n\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.958\nNow, to give you a chance to understand\n\n00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:13.958\nwhy there is power in that statement,\n\n00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:15.958\nI've got to give you the basics of Space 101.\n\n00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:21.958\nAnd the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.\n\n00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nAnybody drink one of these here this week?\n\n00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.958\nYou'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.958\nThat's more than you pay for TED,\n\n00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:34.958\nif Google dropped their sponsorship.\n\n00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:42.958\nThe second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.\n\n00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:46.958\nThus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,\n\n00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nyou are literally blowing away enormous sums of money\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nevery time you hit the accelerator.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:55.958\nNot even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.\n\n00:12:55.958 --> 00:13:00.958\nSo, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?\n\n00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.958\nThere is a place where you can.\n\n00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.958\nIn fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower\n\n00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.958\nif you can find propellant on the moon.\n\n00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.958\nThere is a little-known mission that was launched\n\n00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.958\nby the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.\n\n00:13:16.958 --> 00:13:18.958\nAnd the most amazing thing that came out of that mission\n\n00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nwas a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\non the south pole of the moon.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.958\nThat signal was so strong,\n\n00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.958\nit could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water\n\n00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:34.958\nburied in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years\n\n00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nby the impact of asteroids and comet material.\n\n00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.958\nIf we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,\n\n00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.958\nwe have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.\n\n00:13:48.958 --> 00:13:50.958\nWe can't do that right now.\n\n00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.958\nThe way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack\n\n00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nthat has to be launched from the ground,\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.958\nand resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.\n\n00:13:57.958 --> 00:13:59.958\nWe have to beat that.\n\n00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWe can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:06.958\nWe can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.\n\n00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:10.958\nThis is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,\n\n00:14:10.958 --> 00:14:12.958\nwith Dr. Lowell Wood's group.\n\n00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:16.958\nAnd we can extend that now to just about everything.\n\n00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:18.958\nBob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.\n\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:19.958\nWe can go much further.\n\n00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:24.958\nWe can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.\n\n00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nThere's another thing.\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:28.958\nWhen you're coming back from the moon,\n\n00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.958\nyou have to deal with orbital mechanics.\n\n00:14:30.958 --> 00:14:32.958\nIt says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster\n\n00:14:32.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nthan you really want to be to get back to your gas station.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.958\nYou got two choices.\n\n00:14:37.958 --> 00:14:41.958\nYou can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.\n\n00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nYou can dive into the stratosphere,\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.958\nand precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.\n\n00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:48.958\nIt has never been done.\n\n00:14:48.958 --> 00:14:52.958\nIt's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --\n\n00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.958\nbetter than Disney.\n\n00:14:54.958 --> 00:14:56.958\nThe traditional approach to space exploration\n\n00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.958\nhas been that you carry all the fuel you need\n\n00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.958\nto get everybody back in case of an emergency.\n\n00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:02.958\nIf you try to do that for the moon,\n\n00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:06.958\nyou're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.\n\n00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.958\nBut if you send a mining team there,\n\n00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:10.958\nwithout the return propellant, first --\n\n00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:14.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nDid any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?\n\n00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nThis is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.\n\n00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.958\nI like this equipment, you know, and I really value it\n\n00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.958\nso we're not going to burn the gear.\n\n00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:30.958\nBut, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,\n\n00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:32.958\nand it would be the most dramatic demonstration\n\n00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:34.958\nthat you could do something worthwhile off this planet\n\n00:15:34.958 --> 00:15:36.958\nthat has ever been done.\n\n00:15:36.958 --> 00:15:39.958\nThere's a myth that you can't do anything in space\n\n00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.958\nfor less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.\n\n00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:44.958\nThat's not true.\n\n00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.958\nIn seven years, we could pull off\n\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.958\nan industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate\n\n00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.958\nthat you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.\n\n00:15:53.958 --> 00:15:56.958\nWe're living in one of the most exciting times in history.\n\n00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.958\nWe're at a magical confluence where private wealth\n\n00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.958\nand imagination are driving the demand for access to space.\n\n00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:05.958\nThe orbital refueling stations I've just described\n\n00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.958\ncould create an entirely new industry and provide the final key\n\n00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:12.958\nfor opening space to the general exploration.\n\n00:16:12.958 --> 00:16:16.958\nTo bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.\n\n00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.958\nWe can do it by jump-starting with an industrial\n\n00:16:18.958 --> 00:16:21.958\nLewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,\n\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:23.958\nto mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate\n\n00:16:23.958 --> 00:16:27.958\nthey can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.\n\n00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:30.958\nTalk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities\n\n00:16:30.958 --> 00:16:32.958\nof purpose and timing.\n\n00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.958\nI would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.\n\n00:16:37.958 --> 00:16:39.958\nI intend to lead that expedition.\n\n00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:47.958\n(Applause)\n\n00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:50.958\nIt can be done in seven years with the right backing.\n\n00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:54.958\nThose who join me in making it happen will become a part of history\n\n00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.958\nand join other bold individuals from time past\n\n00:16:56.958 --> 00:17:00.958\nwho, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.\n\n00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:06.958\nThere was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.\n\n00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.958\nWe have collectively forgotten that lesson.\n\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.958\nNow we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.\n\n00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:21.958\n100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,\n\n00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.958\nI intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon\n\n00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.958\nand complete the final piece\n\n00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:30.958\nthat will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.\n\n00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:31.958\nThank you.\n\n00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:39.958\n(Applause)"}, {"title": "Dangerous memes", "duration": "926", "url": "https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_on_dangerous_memes", "transcript": "How many Creationists do we have in the room? Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians. And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy \u2014 would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes. It's all right. You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution. The World Wide Web? Not so sure. Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no. What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life, and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules? And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking \u2014 to our thinking.And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here. So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture, and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass. It climbs up to the top, and it falls, and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs \u2014 trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass. What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of? What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass? What's in it for the ant? And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant. Well then, why is it doing this? Is it just a fluke? Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke. It's a little brain worm. It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle. Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds, and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant, crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle. So there's nothing in it for the ant. The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain, inducing suicidal behavior. Pretty scary.Well, does anything like that happen with human beings? This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course. Well, it may already have occurred to you that Islam means \"surrender,\" or \"submission of self-interest to the will of Allah.\" Well, it's ideas \u2014 not worms \u2014 that hijack our brains. Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas? No, it's worse than that. Most people have. (Laughter) There are a lot of ideas to die for. Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire. (Laughter) Justice. Truth. Communism. Many people have laid down their lives for communism, and many have laid down their lives for capitalism. And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam. These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for. They're infectious.Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about \"infectious repititis.\" It was a term of abuse, in effect. This is unthinking engineering. Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking. It's \"infectious repetitis,\" and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection. Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others. I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is. And you have to have a bumper sticker, you know. You have to have a statement. So, this is mine.The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it. Most of us \u2014 now that the \"Me Decade\" is well in the past \u2014 now we actually do this. One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives. This is what our summum bonum is. It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have. Now, this is a profound biological effect. It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests. And no other species does anything at all like it.Well, how are we going to think about this? It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one. Unmistakable. Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this? Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together? The idea of replicating ideas; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain. Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term \"memes,\" and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book \"The Selfish Gene.\" Now here am I talking about his idea. Well, you see, it's not his. Yes \u2014 he started it. But it's everybody's idea now. And he's not responsible for what I say about memes. I'm responsible for what I say about memes.Actually, I think we're all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas, but for their likely misuses. So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me, that these ideas not be abused and misused. They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous. And it's just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another. So we have to keep plugging away, trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread. But it is a problem. We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out, because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.So let me just point out: memes are like viruses. That's what Richard said, back in '93. And you might think, \"Well, how can that be? I mean, a virus is \u2014 you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?\" Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but \u2014 what's a virus? A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude. (Laughter) That is, there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does. And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude. What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom? Not silicon. They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium. What's a word made of? Sometimes when people say, \"Do memes exist?\" I say, \"Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?\" If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced. There are different species of memes. Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple? Simple, beautiful furniture? And, of course, they're basically extinct now. And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom is that one should be celibate. Not just the priests. Everybody. Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter) But in fact that's not why they went extinct. They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren't there. And there were lots of widows and orphans, people like that, who needed a foster home. And so they had a ready supply of converts. And they could keep it going. And, in principle, it could've gone on forever, with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts. The idea being passed on through proselytizing, instead of through the gene line.So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they're not being passed on genetically. A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness. After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite. There are other parasites that do this \u2014 which render the host sterile. It's part of their plan. They don't have to have minds to have a plan.I'm just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend. I've not time to go into more of it. In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, \"Guns, Germs and Steel,\" he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel, that conquered the new hemisphere \u2014 the Western hemisphere \u2014 that conquered the rest of the world. When European explorers and travelers spread out, they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to, that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years, of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens. And they just wiped out \u2014 these pathogens just wiped out the native people, who had no immunity to them at all.And we're doing it again. We're doing it this time with toxic ideas. Yesterday, a number of people \u2014 Nicholas Negroponte and others \u2014 spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out, thanks to all the new technology all over the world. And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful. But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas. Now, this has been realized for some time. Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam, one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden. \"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests, ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations.\" Memes.These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures. They are wiping out languages. They are wiping out traditions and practices. And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven't developed the immunity. We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture. We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things \u2014 we shrug them off. They're like a mild cold. They're not a big deal for us. But we should recognize that for many people in the world, they are a big deal. And we should be very alert to this. As we spread our education and our technology, one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes \u2014 the memes that they are prepared to die for.Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes? That is not the job of the science of memetics. Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be. This is not the place for hate and anger. If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV. But the way to deal with that is to do science, and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.Get the facts. Work out the implications. There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do. And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them. You will never annihilate the germs. What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence. That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties. That's all the time I have, so thank you very much for your attention.", "id": 116, "subtitle": "WEBVTT\nX-TIMESTAMP-MAP=MPEGTS:900000,LOCAL:00:00:00.000\n\n00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.958\nHow many Creationists do we have in the room?\n\n00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.958\nProbably none.

It's a lancet fluke.\n\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.958\nIt's a little brain worm.\n\n00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.958\nIt's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow\n\n00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.958\nin order to continue its life cycle.\n\n00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.958\nSalmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,\n\n00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.958\nand lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,\n\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958\ncrawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.\n\n00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.958\nSo there's nothing in it for the ant.\n\n00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:40.958\nThe ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,\n\n00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.958\ninducing suicidal behavior.\n\n00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:46.958\nPretty scary.\n\n00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.958\nWell, does anything like that happen with human beings?\n\n00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:56.958\nThis is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.\n\n00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:01.958\nWell, it may already have occurred to you\n\n00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:11.958\nthat Islam means \"surrender,\" or \"submission of self-interest to the will of Allah.\"\n\n00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:17.958\nWell, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.\n\n00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.958\nNow, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population\n\n00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:28.958\nhas had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?\n\n00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.958\nNo, it's worse than that.\n\n00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.958\nMost people have.\n\n00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.958\nThere are a lot of ideas to die for.\n\n00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:44.958\nFreedom, if you're from New Hampshire.\n\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:52.958\nJustice. Truth. Communism.\n\n00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.958\nMany people have laid down their lives for communism,\n\n00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.958\nand many have laid down their lives for capitalism.\n\n00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:02.958\nAnd many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.\n\n00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:07.958\nThese are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.\n\n00:04:07.958 --> 00:04:09.958\nThey're infectious.\n\n00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958\nYesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about \"infectious repititis.\"\n\n00:04:14.958 --> 00:04:17.958\nIt was a term of abuse, in effect.\n\n00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.958\nThis is unthinking engineering.\n\n00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.958\nWell, most of the cultural spread that goes on\n\n00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:27.958\nis not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:29.958\nIt's \"infectious repetitis,\"\n\n00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:34.958\nand we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens\n\n00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:38.958\nso that we can understand the conditions of infection.\n\n00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:47.958\nHosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.\n\n00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:53.958\nI myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards\n\n00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:57.958\nis that people ask us what the meaning of life is.\n\n00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.958\nAnd you have to have a bumper sticker,\n\n00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.958\nyou know. You have to have a statement.\n\n00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.958\nSo, this is mine.\n\n00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.958\nThe secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are\n\n00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:11.958\nand dedicate your life to it.\n\n00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:15.958\nMost of us -- now that the \"Me Decade\" is well in the past --\n\n00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:17.958\nnow we actually do this.\n\n00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:20.958\nOne set of ideas or another\n\n00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.958\nhave simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.\n\n00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.958\nThis is what our summum bonum is.\n\n00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:30.958\nIt's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.\n\n00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:34.958\nNow, this is a profound biological effect.\n\n00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:37.958\nIt's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.\n\n00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:41.958\nAnd no other species does anything at all like it.\n\n00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:43.958\nWell, how are we going to think about this?\n\n00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.958\nIt is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.\n\n00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.958\nUnmistakable.\n\n00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.958\nNow, what theories do we want to use to look at this?\n\n00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.958\nWell, many theories. But how could something tie them together?\n\n00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.958\nThe idea of replicating ideas;\n\n00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:03.958\nideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.\n\n00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:08.958\nRichard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term \"memes,\"\n\n00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:13.958\nand put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea\n\n00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.958\nin his book \"The Selfish Gene.\"\n\n00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.958\nNow here am I talking about his idea.\n\n00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:24.958\nWell, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.\n\n00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.958\nBut it's everybody's idea now.\n\n00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.958\nAnd he's not responsible for what I say about memes.\n\n00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958\nI'm responsible for what I say about memes.\n\n00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:39.958\nActually, I think we're all responsible\n\n00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:45.958\nfor not just the intended effects of our ideas,\n\n00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.958\nbut for their likely misuses.\n\n00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:53.958\nSo it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,\n\n00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:57.958\nthat these ideas not be abused and misused.\n\n00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.958\nThey're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.\n\n00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.958\nAnd it's just about a full-time job\n\n00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.958\ntrying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas\n\n00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:14.958\nfrom caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.\n\n00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.958\nSo we have to keep plugging away,\n\n00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:19.958\ntrying to correct the misapprehensions\n\n00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:27.958\nso that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.\n\n00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:29.958\nBut it is a problem.\n\n00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.958\nWe don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,\n\n00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.958\nbecause there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.\n\n00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:44.958\nSo let me just point out: memes are like viruses.\n\n00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.958\nThat's what Richard said, back in '93.\n\n00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.958\nAnd you might think, \"Well, how can that be?\n\n00:07:48.958 --> 00:07:55.958\nI mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?\"\n\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:08:00.958\nYesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications\n\n00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:01.958\nbut -- what's a virus?\n\n00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:05.958\nA virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.\n\n00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:06.958\n(Laughter)\n\n00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.958\nThat is, there is something about it\n\n00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:12.958\nthat tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.\n\n00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:16.958\nAnd that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.\n\n00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:22.958\nWhat's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?\n\n00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.958\nNot silicon.\n\n00:08:24.958 --> 00:08:28.958\nThey're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.\n\n00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.958\nWhat's a word made of?\n\n00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:35.958\nSometimes when people say, \"Do memes exist?\"\n\n00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:39.958\nI say, \"Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?\"\n\n00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:44.958\nIf they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.\n\n00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:47.958\nThen there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.\n\n00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:50.958\nThere are different species of memes.\n\n00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.958\nRemember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?\n\n00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.958\nSimple, beautiful furniture?\n\n00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.958\nAnd, of course, they're basically extinct now.\n\n00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:11.958\nAnd one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom\n\n00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:13.958\nis that one should be celibate.\n\n00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:15.958\nNot just the priests. Everybody.\n\n00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:23.958\nWell, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)\n\n00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.958\nBut in fact that's not why they went extinct.\n\n00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:31.958\nThey survived as long as they did\n\n00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.958\nat a time when the social safety nets weren't there.\n\n00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:36.958\nAnd there were lots of widows and orphans,\n\n00:09:36.958 --> 00:09:39.958\npeople like that, who needed a foster home.\n\n00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958\nAnd so they had a ready supply of converts.\n\n00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958\nAnd they could keep it going.\n\n00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:46.958\nAnd, in principle, it could've gone on forever,\n\n00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:49.958\nwith perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.\n\n00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.958\nThe idea being passed on through proselytizing,\n\n00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.958\ninstead of through the gene line.\n\n00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:03.958\nSo the ideas can live on in spite of the fact\n\n00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.958\nthat they're not being passed on genetically.\n\n00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:10.958\nA meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.\n\n00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:18.958\nAfter all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.\n\n00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:25.958\nThere are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.\n\n00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.958\nIt's part of their plan.\n\n00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:32.958\nThey don't have to have minds to have a plan.\n\n00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:38.958\nI'm just going to draw your attention to just one\n\n00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:46.958\nof the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.\n\n00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:49.958\nI've not time to go into more of it.\n\n00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:53.958\nIn Jared Diamond's wonderful book, \"Guns, Germs and Steel,\"\n\n00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:59.958\nhe talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,\n\n00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:04.958\nthat conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --\n\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:06.958\nthat conquered the rest of the world.\n\n00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:13.958\nWhen European explorers and travelers spread out,\n\n00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.958\nthey brought with them the germs\n\n00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.958\nthat they had become essentially immune to,\n\n00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.958\nthat they had learned how to tolerate over\n\n00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.958\nhundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,\n\n00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.958\nof living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.\n\n00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:34.958\nAnd they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,\n\n00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:37.958\nwho had no immunity to them at all.\n\n00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.958\nAnd we're doing it again.\n\n00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.958\nWe're doing it this time with toxic ideas.\n\n00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:50.958\nYesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --\n\n00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.958\nspoke about all the wonderful things\n\n00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.958\nthat are happening when our ideas get spread out,\n\n00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.958\nthanks to all the new technology all over the world.\n\n00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:03.958\nAnd I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.\n\n00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:11.958\nBut among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world\n\n00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.958\nthanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.\n\n00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:19.958\nNow, this has been realized for some time.\n\n00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:25.958\nSayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,\n\n00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:30.958\none of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.\n\n00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:35.958\n\"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,\n\n00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:41.958\nballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations.\" Memes.\n\n00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:45.958\nThese memes are spreading around the world\n\n00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:50.958\nand they are wiping out whole cultures.\n\n00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:52.958\nThey are wiping out languages.\n\n00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:57.958\nThey are wiping out traditions and practices.\n\n00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:05.958\nAnd it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste\n\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:08.958\nto people that haven't developed the immunity.\n\n00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:14.958\nWe have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.\n\n00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:20.958\nWe're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off.\n\n00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.958\nThey're like a mild cold.\n\n00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.958\nThey're not a big deal for us.\n\n00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:28.958\nBut we should recognize that for many people in the world,\n\n00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:32.958\nthey are a big deal.\n\n00:13:32.958 --> 00:13:35.958\nAnd we should be very alert to this.\n\n00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:38.958\nAs we spread our education and our technology,\n\n00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:46.958\none of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes\n\n00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:52.958\nthat are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes\n\n00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.958\nas a dire threat to their favorite memes --\n\n00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:58.958\nthe memes that they are prepared to die for.\n\n00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:02.958\nWell now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?\n\n00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:07.958\nThat is not the job of the science of memetics.\n\n00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:13.958\nMemetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.\n\n00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:17.958\nThis is not the place for hate and anger.\n\n00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:22.958\nIf you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.\n\n00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.958\nBut the way to deal with that is to do science,\n\n00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:33.958\nand understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.\n\n00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.958\nGet the facts.\n\n00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.958\nWork out the implications.\n\n00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.958\nThere's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts\n\n00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:45.958\nand can figure out the best thing to do.\n\n00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:50.958\nAnd, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.\n\n00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.958\nYou will never annihilate the germs.\n\n00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:59.958\nWhat you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like\n\n00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:04.958\nthat will encourage the evolution of avirulence.\n\n00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:12.958\nThat will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations\n\n00:15:12.958 --> 00:15:15.958\nof the most toxic varieties.\n\n00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.958\nThat's all the time I have,\n\n00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.958\nso thank you very much for your attention."}]

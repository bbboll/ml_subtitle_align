\chapter{Feature extraction}

The state of the art method for feature extraction from audio for speech recognition purposes is to use Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Based on the underlying assumption, that audio frequencies change very little over very short intervals of time, the signal is divided into 10ms intervals. For each interval, a sequence of transformations is applied, resulting in 13 coefficients.

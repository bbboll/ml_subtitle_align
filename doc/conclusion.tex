In summary, we could successfully tackle the problem of automatic subtitle alignment. The results depend on the class of neural network and the loss function that was used during the training process. At the end, the most difficult parts to implement were the nearly exact extraction of the timings of each spoken word as well as the optimization part after the neural network training. \\

For training the classifier, we used an Intel(???) machine with ???.

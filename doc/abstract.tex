The synchronization of subtitles is very expensive in time when aligning all timestamps by hand. That is why known video-sharing websites like YouTube and others use machine learning systems to generate subtitles automatically. However, solving the general speech-to-text problem is a big problem for itself. Fortunately, in most cases where subtitles are considered as an important role, transcripts are still be used. \\

For this work we implemented and trained a convolutional neural network to automatically align a transcript to its given audio file. This problem is much easier to solve than general speech-to-text, but the result is still a usefull tool for generating subtitles as aligning a given transcript by hand is an expensive and error-prone process.

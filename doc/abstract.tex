The synchronization of subtitles is very time consuming when aligning all timestamps by hand. That is why known video-sharing websites like YouTube and others use machine learning systems to generate subtitles automatically. However, solving the general speech-to-text problem is very challenging. Fortunately, in most cases where subtitles are considered particularly important, transcripts are still being used, so the speech-to-text part is not necessary. \\

For this work we implemented and trained neural networks to automatically align a transcript to its given audio file. This problem is much easier to solve than general speech-to-text, but the result is still a useful tool for generating subtitles as aligning a given transcript by hand is an expensive and error-prone process. \\

We discuss a simple as well as a deep convolutional neural network and a convolutional LSTM neural network in this project. The model structure and its training result are listed at the end of this work.

Manual transcription and alignment of subtitles to audio is very time consuming. For this reason, machine learning systems are employed to perform this task for large video-sharing websites. However, solving the general speech-to-text problem is very challenging and manual transcription is still prevalent for high profile usecases such as movie captions. For these applications, automated alignment of the finished transcripts to the audio presents opportunity to reduce manual labour.\\

In the present work, we implemented and trained neural networks to automatically align a transcript to its given audio file. This problem is much easier to solve than general speech-to-text, but the result is still a useful tool for generating subtitles for the reasons outlined above. \\

We discuss multiple different network architectures as well as cost functions and modelling approaches. Notably, deep convolutional neural networks and a convolutional LSTM neural network were employed. The model structure and corresponding training results are listed at the end of this work.
